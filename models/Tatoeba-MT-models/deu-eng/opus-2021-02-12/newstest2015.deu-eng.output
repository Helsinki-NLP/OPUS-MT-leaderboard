The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi has met his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko on his first important foreign visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the world's third largest economic nation.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
India is also reported to be hoping for a defence cooperation treaty between the two nations.
Police of Karratha arrested 20-year-old after fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver had driven it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police reported that the driver ignored the stop signals and continued driving on Burgess Road before taking off to the bushland, where the officers lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who corresponded to the driver's description were later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The Karratha police accused a 20-year-old man of disregarding a stop signal and reckless driving.
He is scheduled to appear before the District Court in Karratha on September 23rd.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read out at a hearing by the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "conscious, asleep, and could not signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the trial date for November 17th at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Returning to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have put forward a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil rights.
"Just as unions die, so do middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and deputy chairman of Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, I proudly present the Employee Empowerment Act together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities in the case of discrimination on the basis of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces.
Complementing the National Labour Law to create an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organise a trade union representation, to sue for justice before a civil court - and to obtain compensation or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks experienced by trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand, and comply with labor laws.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
Aware that the workers and their trade unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the workers' rights to union and collective bargaining and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would replace Adolf Hitler's fascism with a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements restricting this right or aimed at reducing it are null and void; measures aimed at this are unlawful.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other writers provided a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join unions to protect his interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans stated that the right to establish a trade union - and that this union should then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - must be protected.
After these rights have come under fire in America, it is indeed very wise to recall the American ideal, according to which working people must have the right to unite and make themselves heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but enlarged it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history keeps them.
History remembers, and that's what we should do.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representation - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and fulfilled the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
On Sunday, a U.S. federal judge provisionally stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, which lawyers say would have probably led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was made law by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and is due to enter into force on Sept. 1, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient admission right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles around their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions for the time being while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while they seek to obtain these rights," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his judgment.
Within one month a hearing shall be held for the judge in order to bring about a more lasting decision on the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the most recent in a series of judgments against similar measures, saying that doctors allowed so more time to obtain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana are escaping a swindling law that wants to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Centre for Reproduction Rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for rights of introduction.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
Key areas of a Texas law that would have forced most of the state's remaining clinics to shut down were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that admission rights require unnecessary restrictions on doctors.
Opponents of abortion oppose the fact that the measures are designed to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of the closure of clinics.
Only a doctor performing abortions in Louisiana has a patient’s right to be referred to the Centre for Reproductive Rights.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the surgery for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the verdict, state officials said that they would not punish doctors for performing abortions while their applications for patient referral rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have made a video hommage for her mother online, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
SMALL STUDIES: New medicines could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-existing diseases, as well as social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
The survival rate was lowest for older women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the time of diagnosis.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services in order to counter the distances, it proposed, as a possible remedy, a reinforcement of the service of inbound doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide more intensive care for women at their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study showed poor long-term survival rates in women in ovarian cancer regardless of their geographical status and stressed the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33, learned from the Gold Coast that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret declining number of homeowners
The decline, together with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could result in garden centres losing tens of thousands of pounds a year if today's young consumers reach the "nuclear age group for garden products" according to a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend on average 55 percent of the amount spent by people with a home for their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting front gardens for park purposes, and the declining garden size are further factors that threaten the industry in which an estimated £5 billion is being sold annually.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for RHS, said: "Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them when moving."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retailing due to rising numbers of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also forecast an improved market situation for this year due to better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by opposition politician Imran Khan and clergyman Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital Islamabad about 1000 demonstrators stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The transmitter stopped operation for about 40 minutes, but now broadcasts again.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away they delivered themselves equipped with sticks and stones clashes with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refused.
Meanwhile, the country's army calls for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and without using violence."
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday evening, the military announced: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already played more often.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in the parliamentary elections last May.
The protests escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their followers to advance to Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey appoints US diplomat for spy report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has summoned the country's senior US diplomats for information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the US Embassy's Managing Director and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and British intelligence.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report, which was also targeted by Germany's most important secret service, caused a much more angry reaction by the Turkish government.
Warnstrike: Locomotive drivers threaten with consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike of the locomotive drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The stand announced for 6 pm to 9 pm concerns all transport companies nationwide, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn traffic,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

said Sven Schmitte, district chairman of the union of German locomotive drivers (GDL), in Düsseldorf.
We're expecting significant failures.
There were no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike was freight transport.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL had not said where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to foresee the consequences in concrete terms.
Chief of Police of Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the District Attorney of Mallorca.
The chief of the Calvià police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious Binge Drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested after allegations of corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the Mallorcan Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the allegations of corruption and are interrogated by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners testified that the nepotism of the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our livelihood out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
This summer, Magaluf made international headlines due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing on 24 men during a drunken tour of Feltatio.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the disorderly behaviour of alcoholic tourists in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the notorious alcoholic-drinked pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the pub tour organizer Carnage have to pay a penalty of €55,000 (73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for many alcohol-related accidents, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The EARLY has brought a winter surprise to South Australia, with heavy showers and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9pm another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6,6mm, which had already fallen on Sunday night.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a casting that started just before 8 p.m. and caused almost 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After last week’s winter provided an early dose of spring, the city’s temperatures fell back to a peak of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The bad weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a shear wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off.
At this point, winds reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to take off on a second approach and finally set up at about 20.40.
The delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: High time for big networking
In view of the galloping technical progress, which threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech control panels, our columnist Bernd Matthies consoles himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
While I'm writing this, I'm looking at the spiral cable that connects the phone to the phone, and I think, "Boah, how retro is that?
But there's a thought behind it: if the cable weren't, all the listeners would fly around the house in no time, and that would be much more retro.
In any case, the Ekeltronic (Ekeltronic?
No, typos: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electronic scrap of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And those who still have a tube TV in the living room today, for example, simply say that they reject television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the push of the Ifa at the Funkturm this week once again shows us our absolute incompetence in electronics.
The layman, who used to dominate washing machine and CD player blindly, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are being spread out in front of him with incomprehensible expert talk: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" the press office promises us.
Yeah, are you okay?
What do you want to talk about with people who obviously volunteer to spread such quarks?
Basically, for about 20 years now, the main issue is that we should network our house.
So that the yogurt can reorder itself, so that the fire detector informs us on holiday in the Maldives that it is burning in the study.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we had air conditioning from the office on our early arrival...?
Yes, but that requires air conditioning.
But a dream will surely come true soon: We lift our wristwatch, tell her loudly "Saugen!" - and at home the vacuum robot starts.
Crazy.
It all boils down to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurring", an industry expert raves, you can connect the washing machine to a headphone, the steam cooker sends the weather report and the data glasses indicate how long the pizza in the oven still takes, which is of no use because we are stuck in traffic.
We also know from daily practice that when a new-fashioned device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
What is another reason for this is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio shows.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday after spending the summer in air raid shelters, while rocket and mortar fire hit their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools in Gaza remained closed, while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in southern Israel marked by rocket bullet holes, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed grenade fragments from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit weird" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a cease-fire stopped the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gazan border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza, which is heavily marked by Palestinian fire.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on an indefinite ceasefire.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas' call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to start this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and struggles continue, the education authorities postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will be reopened soon, so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy currently living in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl challenges NPD ban proceedings
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has called for an end to the ongoing NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should come to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is doing worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU country chief in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a gratifying development in the right direction and a development that rather leads me to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had barely failed at the five-percent hurdle in the Sunday vote.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party had failed in 2003, because the protection of the constitution also had informants in the NPD top.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long period of preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At Neuländer Platz, refugees are now housed in tents.
The central reception for refugees in Harburg bursts at the seams.
Now the Interior Department has put up three tents of the Red Cross next to it.
The district politicians were only informed shortly before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to stir up reservations among citizens and do not give district politicians the opportunity to participate constructively in the humane housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Green Party in the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party demands that the Harburg district administration currently provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the initial reception are the rush of people looking for help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough space in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, with a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for home ownership in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to Monday's RP data.
Due to this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
Research leader Tim Lawless of RP Data announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-tiered market.
The figures from RP Data show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne they rose by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by government spending cuts and where prices rose by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr Lawless also said that with the beginning of spring, there would now be an increase in the number of properties for sale for the next few months, which would subject the market to "a real test".
"Looking at the ever-high auction price rate, a generally fast sales rate, and the ever-low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts statements of the managing director Peer Medau and attests to him to pose "like a general".
This is not the style of the university, according to the communication.
Thus, the Medau family had already been informed verbally about the idea of the university in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July is definitely wrong," says Pötzl.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans were not "preliminaries or even decisions", but that there were "preferences".
The development of the narrow road up to the castle is also less dramatic than was feared by the Medaus.
There was no mention of a nine-metre-wide road.
According to the current level, the distance is 5.50 metres, which is one metre wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The Medau-operators' argument that their free and school-owned parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future, Pötzl does not want to apply.
Train parking is not possible at all, because this can now be solved intelligently, as with other public parking spaces.
Think of the locals
According to the president of the university, the nursery Bergwichtel, which is located on the grounds and at the front door would lead the access to the parking deck, should "not be affected".
Rather, he points out that "it is not only about the nursery, but also about the residents at the entrance to Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring secondary school.
So it's much more about than about the particular interests of the Medau gentlemen," says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parents' advisory board of the crèche, the extension of the street would justify a "losing of the few natural spots of Coburg", "the reader can decide for himself".
In early October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Office, intends to inform the city councils about the structural development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Last week, Peer Medau informed the parents of the nursery about the university's plans.
According to this, the access for the new parking deck should not lead over the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Straße as before, but over the Medau mountain.
This would mean that the narrow road would have to be extended two-lane over a length of about one kilometre.
According to estimates by the Medaus, traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase tenfold.
About 2000 vehicles are mentioned every day.
The city did not want to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga SG Flensburg-Handewitt led for this decision above all health problems.
The decision was not easy for me, it has matured for several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team," said the 2007 World Champion on his Facebook page.
He thus retires internationally with a balance sheet of 167 international matches and 576 goals for Germany.
Because he wants to go for several more years on goal hunting for the Champions League winner from Flensburg, he is no longer available to the new national coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf conducted a "long and good conversation" with Icelander, who announced his squad for the international matches against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me just as much as they will inspire my long-standing fellow players and my successors.
But for my club I would like to be available healthy over the next few years, which requires longer regeneration breaks, which does not allow the current double load.
The left-handed had to fear the end of his career in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which had later caused a strong inflammation.
An emergency surgery and two further procedures followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a settlement.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass any body without a trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot operations, which took place at short intervals in 2012, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
In addition, there are some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year I noticed that I control my head, but I can't fool my body," Glandorf explained in an interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
For a comeback, he would only be ready in an absolute emergency.
"When all the ropes are torn, I am always ready to talk," explained the two-time father of the family to the specialist magazine.
However, I can count the years when I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I also became rather humble in terms of my health.
After my career, I want to be able to walk at least fairly straight.
In addition to the World Cup title in 2007 and winning the Champions League in 2014, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he won the European Cup with Flensburg.
German economy shrunk by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was announced by the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong start of the year, the total GDP increase for the first half of the year is 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmann town of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
This is the largest bike tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne with their registration for the organization of this tour through the Münsterland.
This tour was offered to interested parties in various trade journals.
We come from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland in this way", the cyclists were happy about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the club home of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace journey" through the city over the wall, where the start was also made.
Further, the route, which was advertised for three different categories, led towards Herrenholz via the Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were fed on the way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organiser Jos ter Huerne and mayor's representative Heinz Lölfing were very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for everyone involved.
The organisation went without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, there were not as many participants as the organiser had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see each other again in 2015 in hopefully nice weather on 30 August or during another weekend", the cyclists promised to come back to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's ruthlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, what Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political-proof activist, ex-prisoner, in "Monk and Warrior" on 287 pages on paper.
The Munich-born on June 1, 1947, wrote down his memoirs, not chronologically, but more scraps of thought for shreds of thought, each chapter initiated by a suitable lyrics.
And he is ruthlessly honest about it: From onanie as a gymnasiast to shoplifting and drug use, he does not omit human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad space also takes on abstract but even more important concepts: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all this he tries to get to the bottom, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and how he was influenced not only by music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also by his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the living man Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who is created "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving out all unnecessary things".
Between all the high-spirited views there are also short anecdotes to the earth: about fights in a pub frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride, in which he aimed at a tree frontally.
Again, he is ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants at Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful of his relationship with his father.
It was hard knowing him.
You never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already adults when I was a child - went with him to the pub and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I never had such a conversation with him.
For most of my life, he was that serious guy in the corner who read the paper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father's time, he nevertheless gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a little lighter now, but they're dark, smoky, deep stygic mazes with flames and smoke and lots of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could slowly hear him start singing because he was able to wash the foundry away.
As I walked around, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew.
However, Henry grew up as a child without the love of his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said, "I love you."
It wasn't until my mother was ill by the end of her life that we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I did this fitness thing and had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
Nobody likes carrots.
Henry's career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since being praised by critics for his Othello, he has been taken over by the theatre.
It followed The Comedy of Mistakes, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He began working in a factory when he was only 16 years old.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote about him to New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black imitator/commedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I also had to learn from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right to stage at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
It was very unpleasant for my family.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-long award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
Through the introduction of figures that both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the 1980s.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertisements, documentary films, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought to himself, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just bringing time around or kicking a little bit."
After that came a documentary series for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought he was mostly a middle-class domain, whites in tights and a cabbage in the front.
So I was very scared of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Put a few words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I had the feeling that I could do it.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head on properly.
"That's what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your lyrics, do some research.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of delusions.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical mistake and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice told me, "You have to bridge 10 minutes while they repair the computer."
Instead, the stage director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I left the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for this.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
That was a good thing, too, so it's like a big shield of the gods telling me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a DONNERNING voice.
So I'll stick with it.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
Henry, however, still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is haunted by humorous outbreaks, while he imitates people over and over again.
I decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think that this kind of instant satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for this, you're driving it in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live at Apollo when I want to, but overall it doesn't give me as much as before.
I'll ask him if he'll ever make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I ever want to give it up again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Huthi Party said "Ansar Allah".
The access to Parliament had also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
According to the paper, Houthi threatened a further escalation of the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and demand the resignation of the government.
The Houthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there are always bloody fights with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers civil servants to contain "spirit workers"
Kenya has started to register all state officials biometrically to delete "ghost workers" from government payrolls.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salary payments after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service when he took office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month in payments for "ghost workers" and other abusive financial practices were lost.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid out to accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from Nairobi, the capital.
All officials must now appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, was communicated in a government message.
All those who would not do so without a credible apology were removed from the payroll, the message went on.
"This approach contributes significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by establishing the actual number of officials and also by adjusting the payroll at both levels of government - thus eliminating the "ghost employees," said Anne Waiguru, Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be tried in court for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, claim 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings at the Düsseldorf Regional Court.
This was announced by a court spokesman on Monday.
The application states that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and that Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach has purchased valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
For 44 years he was in school service, 23 of them as headmaster.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many confessed Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as pupils.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his striving to see the human being in the disciple.
The Schneekoppe is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home country.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau, North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became interested in the teaching profession after four years of secondary school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp we went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
That's how Judges went to the Upper Franconian village of Senkendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
For this Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week ten kilometers to the next station, take the train to Bamberg, go there three kilometers across the whole city to school and return in the evening.
After two months Manfred Richter got a bed in a Rot-Kreuz-Heim in Bamberg: together with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.
In 1951, he took the first and in 1954, after three years, the second state examination.
Since Oberfranken did not have a free teaching position for him, he applied to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Fräulein-Zimmer" was his first "office apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958 he moved into a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980 after the school in Kollbach had been dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach school association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69, these were combined in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the Indersdorf School Association was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and from September 1982 the children and their teachers were able to move into the current building, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had an additional work room built on municipal costs and cellar rooms built during the expansion in 1997, although this was not eligible for funding according to the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Richter remembered gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who replied to a presentation by a school council on law and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old.
And he had to learn: "That's not always possible." Whether he means only his pupils or just as his own six children, is not quite clear.
In any case, Richter's doing was sometimes unconventional.
When students beat each other, they didn't get a punitive job from him and were not forced to sit down.
At the expense of the community, Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves purchased and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there was to be a violet.
As rector, Richter maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU) for the good of the school.
After his retirement, he persuaded the non-party judge to run for the municipal council at least as the last member of the CSU list in 1996.
But Richter was pre-elected to sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists stop at the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of racers alone made an impression: the 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour and the accompanying trouser enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Radling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, the 60 kilometers via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started his bike in Bad Vilbel, and Petra Schwing-Döring, head of the company Bad Salzhausen.
All kinds of good things had been prepared for the refreshment of body and spirit: the rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 tins of apple, plum, sprinkle and cheese cake, which were wonderfully mouthful for the skilled cyclists.
"Only country women can bake such cakes," praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be obtained at the drink booth of the Gymverein Geiß-Nidda.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and reaped enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he has already fixed down bicycle chains today".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the company manager still had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the drinking spa by reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to advertise for Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Also promotion manager Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 bike tour 2004 as tour leader, could only catch a breath, since he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated via three telephones and a radio with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle squadron of the police Hessen, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available accommodation capacity.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
The cyclists had a good impression of the spa when they left after one and a half hours: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Schotten, the group was allowed to take a short breather.
But in the evening the cyclists were called for in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottener Gesellschaft für Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festive atmosphere and, of course, had prepared treats, such as flame cake with well-cooled feather whitener.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as board member of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operations in Schotten".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to swing under the open air was eagerly used despite the sportive activity on the bike.
Among the guests were increasingly mixed citizens, who were just as impressed with the good mood as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day the cycling stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the programme.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," reports local media agencies.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, Hürriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized criminal organization and tapping telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist clergyman Fethulla Güllen against him and other persons in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told journalists waiting that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian People's Front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of the school in Slavyansk, who visited Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their future lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It arrives with a proud drag of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And she has her own front-page experience.
Her career began with Bain and Co., a global management consulting firm, where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearson's media world.
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top position of the parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Their severance payment was said to be nearly £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private business skills in Whitehall: she became a cabinet advisor.
Her husband is a former Tory councilman.
As early as May, I described the chairman's task with a poisoned cup.
Not only does the BBC stand at the heart of public life as a huge and complex entity, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust acts in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of one's own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This creates an almost untenable duopoly, which calls for a complete comprehensive reform.
But which new incoming chairman would risk taking on everything and taking apart an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps killing himself.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC reduced in size - power, money and status overtaken.
As competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, convenient collateral, the forthcoming negotiations on royalties for the BBC are particularly dangerous.
For the modest sum of £145.50 per year, the British public buys into what is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and only costs 40 pence per day for each of them.
And apparently the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone these days and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that disparaging tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official account of Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry on Sunday contained a disparaging remark about the Democratic District Attorney, who is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of authority.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another one from Perry's account that denied the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve of the tweet and have deleted it," said the later news.
Perry employees did not respond promptly to requests for comments.
Although Perry's official user account ran out of tweets, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the previous tweet, an unfavorable image was drawn of the District Attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of driving drunkenness in April 2013.
Perry vetoed funding for her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment against Perry, who might be a 2016 presidential candidate, in front of a grand jury in Austin this month.
The text of the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk with the triple permissible alcohol level ... but when I do, I accuse Governor Perry when he talks it out."
I'm the most drunken Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not in charge of the Grand Jury's investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the prosecution a political trick.
His high-ranking team of legal advisers asked the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the prosecution and argued that the law against the senior governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconscionably diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit, which is located in Travis County and investigated in Texas state corruption cases, when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint on the part of a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at the Iowa election meetings during his 2012 presidential nomination, Perry responded to speculation that he would stop posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, saying, "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley once again declares housing market "normal"
One of London's most prominent builders pointed out that the housing market in south-eastern England had returned to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were highly sought after and subject to huge price increases, which prompted the Bank of England to set ceilings for mortgage loans in June due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Piggley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013", adding that this provides a "stable environment for action".
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the cadastral office, prices in the urban area rose by 18.5 percent last year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, low-cost and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year and were around £423,000 at the end of April.
A stronger pound, however, has made property ownership in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "ville tax" before the general elections next May.
Last week, Foxtons, a London real estate agent, warned that the mortgage market report for April, which presented stronger lending regimes, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New Monday data from the Bank of England show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the rise in real estate prices in London in 2015 downwards to 3 percent, on the basis of an already weakening house price awareness.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now fallen by a quarter year after year, according to the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, as the amounts due for future sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Piggley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result the forward sales remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the peak in 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings rose by 40 percent to £280 million per year, and sales by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday before the Company's annual meeting, Mr. Piggley said that the income for Berkeley this year is expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree on the annual pre-tax result at £450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed at £23.96 in London trading in the afternoon.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence by hackers published on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appearance at the 85th Oscar ceremony.
Nude photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images from another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and charged the hacker with "serious violation of privacy."
The authorities have been notified and will pursue all those who have continued to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on Photo Sharing page 4chan were allegedly procured by a gap in Apple's iCloud online storage system. The alleged "master list" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It's not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim vs. the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who are looking at photos my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are really happy with yourselves," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied, however, that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are FALSE, people.
Let's fight back at the beginning. *Wordplay intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a speaker of pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They melted, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard box that you left in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distant, and maybe a little scratchy.
And then shook his hand.
He knew Kratzbürstig.
He was prickly, like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this stinginess was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising for relieving the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion, whom Kevern thought to be her aunt, and who had inherited a property in a damp but paradisiacal valley named Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were licked, there were spiders in the bathrooms, nudibranches had left their marks on all the windows, and believed they owned all this, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbage heads.
It was like the house of a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn holding hands on the broken deckchairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both of them had hooked up in the service console away from the mind, providing the country with soothing music and soothing news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had liked to listen to while blinds were closed in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their original aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsolescent, just as the word obsolescent.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations would never have done, and how people choose the From Plate Washer to Millionaire Memoires, Cooking Books and Love Novels in books, so they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing great feet in a grossly comic Serenade of Ailinn.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he told her and automatically put two fingers to his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers on your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It had not been a very funny game back then, and it was not very funny now either.
He knew this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard one before.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not strictly forbidden.
Improvising was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
At the beginning of a melody, people wanted to be sure where it would end.
So is the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without hearing about Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or constraints applied.
A conforming society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent - gratefully as those spared from fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport through temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were, like nature, blessed with electronic talent and cared for with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a working phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewers; what was left of the Greeks broke plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as WHAT WAS Gone, IF IT WAS DONE, were afraid of being accused of firing, even for fear that the flames would consume them next - had opened labneh and shisha whistling restaurants, kept in mind, and became depressed with inactivity.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just sung to her could ever be set to music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge carbon-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father have loved such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She thought he was a little weird anyway.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern's sight.
There was nothing else to see all over the world but her uncombed raven-black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say so," she means without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me yet.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't that direct.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your big ankles are exactly the reason I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he didn't have the soothing charm that was needed to tame the intrinsic cruelty in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and rose from her deck chair, overturned the console and spilled the wine they had drunk.
Elderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her arousal she seemed to tremble, like Palmwedel in a storm.
"And your stubbornness is exactly why I'm attracted to you perversely," she said...
Except I'm not.
He felt sorry for her, both for the unnecessary unkindness of his words and for the fear she felt when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more dreary after WHAT had happened than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hands against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a big fist if she wasn't careful!
First kissing them - kissing was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the meaningless love ballads from the console - first kissing them and then hitting them.
According to Kevern, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the kissing itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He rose from the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt leady, but the force of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
You hardly knew each other.
She watched him walk away - as she watched her companion from a room on the upper floor - a man complaining about something he himself had conjured up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bent his back, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was this a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember once, when she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, was working on a short presentation on the continuing violence at low and medium levels in precisely those parts of the country where their reduction, if not abolition, was most likely to be expected, given the funds and energy invested in eradicating this violence.
"A lot has already been done, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that has waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human kindness has been historically rarely felt despite the high-enquiring church towers between the hedges.
But some qualities turn out to be inexorable.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the lower the passion it continues to arouse.
The population cries while listening to sentimental ballads, intoxicates itself with stories of overcome difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless not only the former rawness holds the rural communities as well as our urban structures firmly in hand, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and insidious contentious addiction at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum answered.
Are you a lesbian?
Once again, Esme invoked her right to privacy and refusal to testify.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
This is a non-prejudiced workplace.
We serve a non-judgmental society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and commendable, can occasionally distort results as you have presented them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "remaining" and "raw", could just as well be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural strength and vitality.
If you continue to ride on what has happened, if it has happened, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking away the essential life force of the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you're getting at," Esme Nussbaum answered with a calm voice when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I'm saying nothing but that we are not yet healed as effectively as we pretend to be.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that have been made at all when it has been done.
But this time it's not the others we're taking our anger and our distrust out of.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an angelic patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "when you call actions "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far when you speak of them having omitted their "wrath" and their "mistrust" in "others."
It should not be necessary to remind anyone in your position that, in understanding the past as well as in protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "others".
There was no "we" and there were no "others".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to insinuate, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not suing anyone.
Whether it has been done badly or well, what has happened has happened.
That was back then.
There is no need to say anything about this - we agree on that.
And just as no debt has to be allocated, so no debt has to be repaid if such repayment is appropriate and if there is a way to repay it.
But what does the past serve if we don't learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget them.
If there's anything I can say,
Luther Rabinowitz let his pyramid collapse.
"I will consider her report," he said, dismissing her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, had driven on foot in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Officials of the military in Lesotho denied having planned a coup to overthrow the government and said they were acting against policemen accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the country's army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa after reporting of assassination threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was no de facto coup d'état, but that the military responded to the threat of "political fanatics" whose arming by the police was imminent.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho's defense forces acted after receiving several intelligence reports that some elements were operating within the police who actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that the military action had made the impression of a overthrow.
"Although no one has claimed to have taken the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defense forces have so far shown signs of a coup d'état," he said.
On Sunday, spokesmen of the military of Lesotho announced that the soldiers were retreating to their barracks and that the situation in the capital was calm.
In the meantime, Vice Premier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the leadership during Thabane's absence.
Thabane announced that he believed he had become a target for his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
In Lesotho there has been great tension since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the clashes in his unity government.
He said that his actions did not undermine the government, despite other accusations.
Production in the euro-zone at a 13-month low
The rise in production in the euro-zone slowed to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, according to a closely observed study.
The final markit purchasing manager index of manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went down and factories experienced collapses in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will arrive before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets expect the bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone, as well as the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information later this week as to whether he is considering a quantitative easing for the eurozone, in line with those made by Britain and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the restraining effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as does the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism no longer affect Germany, as well as Spain and the Netherlands, is also not reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts expecting further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economics Expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say for the August Euro-zone Purchasing Managers' Index is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the eurozone seem to find life quite difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that it was "always more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to initiate a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The Hell Decade of Beslan's Survivors: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan School, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now haunting Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end.
The girl photographed in the attempt to climb back into the shot-up school sports hall
She was photographed by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famous when she only tried to climb back into the shot school sports hall in her underwear after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida was looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said back then.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier took her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she was completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I need surgery again.
Some grenade fragments are still in my knee.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says.
"That's what happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I'll think about a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, even though the memory becomes a little weak every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself climbing back to school online, I think that this is the first time that many people see it, understand our catastrophe and help to prevent it from happening again.
The boy who fled through the hail of the bullet, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying infant on the way, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son in his arms outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside with leg injuries in the hospital, assuming that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now dissolved News of the World) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's getting paler in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard, and they didn't make it out.
We never say they've been killed or they're dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open-top car.
But now he is afraid for place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the atrocities," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to go to the police one day and hope that they will take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat Borshch and called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot at her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't gotten any better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They're just like our kids.
I think that for many, the war is part of the news they hear when they're bored or busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past abominations.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes lay down on the sofa, turned his face away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, taller than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around and saw the hell around me, with parts of my body lying all around.
I was absolutely certain that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember calling him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard, and he ran away.
And so life goes on for us, unlike that of many others.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the abominations of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His bloodstained face was scarred when he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day at school before she hurried to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgy managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean, it happened yesterday, some scenes from those days are haunting me all the time.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intrusive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attacks and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day. He said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden in the bookshelf at home.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People repeatedly examine such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is turning into something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing at all with such pain.
It takes us dozens of years to forget about it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had some nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when September 1st approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and attend a medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health wouldn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgij Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgy Faniyev was trapped at the foot of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gym and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time that I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgy Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB Intelligence Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, even the medical ones, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about this, and they should not suffer it, of course.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary draws near.
I'll go to the memorial celebrations.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan, all of them are drawn.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't take part because of his knee.
He's been operated on a number of times, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I would say that he has overcome the horror 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always haunt us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege, and that only adds to my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart weeps for the dead.
I know of families where new children were born, but also widows who never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped inside me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country, and I almost can't believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could reach all these rebels and throw them out as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskaeva, 10
The baby so poignantly carried to safety by a special task force
Saved: Aljona Tskayeva is taken to safety by a Russian special task force (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall in their cruelty.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has with his new wife Svetlana a little girl that he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family, and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of running over girls on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for driving over a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of hitting a girl on the passage at Pittenween in East Neuk.
The indictment states that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, dismissed the charge before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC instituted the trial for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family festival with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also adjust your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Look in our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Do multiple shots - because many will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams usually don't.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this underwater, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So you take a lot of shots.
If your camera has a row mode that takes a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse as you move away from the surface.
If possible, stay close to the surface when you take shots in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor light conditions.
It's especially important when you're working with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you need to get closer to your objects when they're supposed to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the agony of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors care about diagnoses and diseases, while the patients are mostly occupied with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble picking myself up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently accusing his wife Juliet.
"I want everything right now rather than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and disturbed for no reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray were available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the pectoral skin, i.e. the skin covering the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers have lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have been smokers in the past.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos exposure - contact with the fibre building material, which was once considered a "miracle substance" but has now been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore.
Asbestos is, after all, a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when industry voluntarily agreed to stop using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the cloth plumbers, construction workers, carpenters, and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, it seems to be hardly worrying today.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing today the climax of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, this disease kills twice as many people as in road accidents.
Annual mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is still often, present in the homes in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
Parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been identified as the starting point.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber, either.
It was indeed difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I trained for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same illness?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.
"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who have been suffering from mesothelioma for the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one who is still alive."
How many more of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliomer patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatally.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still going to get sick?"
The UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, believes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to be over, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have been killed.
Most of them have no idea they're going to die like this at the moment.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to which the persons concerned frequently turn for damages claims, shows how widespread the scourge of mesothelioma is already.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen was negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she began working at M&S.
Now she has two kids in her twenties.
"Before this," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It was used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is nevertheless considered by the EU and the WHO as a "great health risk" with possible fatalities.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocydolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at the flagship store on Oxford Street, London Alamy
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected, which shows that "a significant proportion of mesotheliomas without known exposure by work or in the home were probably caused by asbestos exposure in the environment."
According to him, much of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government could have been unwittingly exposed to the material.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be stirred up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it seems that the opposite is true.
While the directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that £1 billion will have to be spent over several years to renovate Parliament, modernise electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, MEPs will probably meet at the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos has not been handled according to the respective regulations."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who has never been able to accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos suits were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so difficult to remember all the places you've been working on and the data.
What he remembers exactly is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got a kind of fever.
He was 45 years old, and he was doing surgery late in the evening.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I could make it home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was caused by the pectoral skin, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Admired doctors took X-rays of his chest and used pleural catheters to remove fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
His complaints, however, remained undiagnosed.
His health gradually improved and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011, Abbott's patient with similar symptoms came to his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt ill for the first time, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cave between the rib and chest fur.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
To be honest, I wasn't so worried.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
And so Mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients probably were not exposed to the substance.
But many of the employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for treating doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Pupils put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
Websites now frequently address the issue of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, innocent objects such as floor slabs or shed roofs have included asbestos as standard in our homes.
"It's an industrial poison that's contained in large parts of our property," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that came to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So watch yourself tearing down your garden shed.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I realized I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I've been in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to record all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much longer do I have?"
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life support mechanism - breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is stirred up and the fibres are inhaled, they can get stuck in the pectoral membrane, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pectoral skin and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos is now ironically a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others, who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed to the edge of where the skin is by the breathing process.
It is naturally invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is highly controversial.
Some think it's worth a try.
Treasure doesn't say that.
"You can't cut out the pectoral skin," he says.
You can't get around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect," but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consulting office for people affected four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center," he introduced himself cheerfully when making calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would last four months and would probably only extend his life by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson managed, however, to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage by not having to be remitted, I just called and got an appointment," admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the treatment to be approved.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But when these treatments inevitably fail, many sufferers have another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that even a very low level of exposure posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually filed their case, but it wasn't what Morgan called a "full-value compensation" because Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after his death, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
Indeed, for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation, it is an enormous problem to attribute the fatal exposure to asbestos to a company or a workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance records may be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there were clear new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to claim compensation, even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has established a fund of £350 million funded by the insurance industry for all those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact, but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal damages case could have attributed to them - about £120,000.
About 300 successful applications to the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that £350 million was a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal by insurers for insurers," he says, implying that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time hadn't passed and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven deaths, rapid action is needed every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act last December.
At that time Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their initial deliberations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, which he expects to have a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"Of course, that's the most important thing," says Abbott.
You can see that again and again in patients.
There's something that lets you go on.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Post-care scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer patches around my chest.
I just turned 50.
It's not life-threatening.
It's life-threatening.
Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles again.
Now there is no trace of the tumors visible.
But the process is physically and psychologically very exhausting.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you get negative.
You need to look ahead.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease that I would not grow old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesotheliomer patients such conversations are not pervaded by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as in the end for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China Denies Hong Kong's Right to Government Election, Demonstrators Swear Retribution
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This action is likely to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists initiated planning and mobilization to do so within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress basically allows the Communist leaders to reject all non-peking candidates.
"This isn't unexpected, but it makes us angry," said right-wing expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing had promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defending the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Great Britain gave back control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the residents elect the head of government from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong's citizens have a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is firmly in control of the process through a nomination committee closely controlled by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates will be admitted "with love of the country and love of Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most popular protests in Hong Kong have taken place for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organisers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of occupy central supporters had gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong’s government headquarters within hours of the announcement.
During the demonstration, the organisers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and they were planning waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further information, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online message, the organisers announced that the movement "considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and that the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and increased security measures, including police forces and barricades, took place in front of the government building on Sunday.
The unrest is amplified by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland reinforces competition for products and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong’s values of democracy and freedom of speech will begin to crumble under Beijing’s growing pressure.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement as it endangers business operations - Hong Kong's lifeline.
"The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to raise fears that Hong Kong will get out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China’s state-controlled media also recently reported about Hong Kong’s democracy activists as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the region's history.
The tradition of school-leaving balls in the USA is now transferred to the universities, where Freshmen performances with the private aircraft are offered.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and offer the first luxury travel service in Britain for students today.
To make a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service had a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to move their belongings through the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum of luxury this year.
One company spokesman said that there were no new bookings yet, as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks".
The Company also announced that despite tuition fees of £9,000 per year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as being off-limits.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NIS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month are facing a crisis of cost of living, as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep up with the rising bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at the dormitory.
Feminists criticize racial question and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants lifted their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, about the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminist commentators place gender before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while the tensions in the Midwest were rising and being noticed throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women revolved 100% around the race.
Compared with the answers of black women shortly after the shots of August 9, the personal essays with titles such as "Thoughts to Ferguson from a White Woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in feminism who talk about whiteness and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicised that they must express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black American women are exposed to every day, but which are not regarded as "women's issues" in cultural space.
"I can post something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colored people are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the USA, there is no dichotomy between race and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the issues cleanly; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now combine race and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattry, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattry said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching.
For Hattry, the split between white and black women came at the point where white fighters for women's suffrage, such as Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and found that the fight for electoral rights could only be successful for one group at a time: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand up for women's suffrage, and the right to vote for blacks was to come later," Hattry said.
When you remember such things, you realize with power why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were granted the right to vote in 1920, it still took a decade for white women to organize themselves against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to Ferguson's questions - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "catches" with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to control conception?" asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists, who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she demanded more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on race that are significantly different in public polls - will lead the changes," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism, in which racial as well as gender themes are addressed, some of their comments on the racial theme in America are nevertheless stunned.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson stand in contrast to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that is pushing into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police picked up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the south-west border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform also comes to the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilizes women for the reform of immigration, said that for a re-examination of the issue as an essential women's issue, she only had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories reverberate in the women's organizations," she said.
"Pig House" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a big pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120.000.
Among the details was a picture of the living room of the house - to which also a pig belonged, that his head had placed on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was erroneously published and has now been removed," said one of the company's spokespersons.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique single-family house with a bedroom."
Although the realtor has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The sale of the house caused interest in the social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving almost $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey drew the jackpot in the draw of the first division for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
Shop owner Steve Forward said the profit is providing for conversation in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city doesn't talk about anything else, and everyone's pretty excited.
We thought such a profit could happen.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont only a few weeks earlier had scored a mega win of $7.5 million.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the prize would allow them to travel around the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas asked in the Gladiator Arena
Not only the gladiators stood ankle deep in the mud at the first Rheinbach Roman Day in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumn cold and were completely inspired by the historical spectacle.
There was a colourful dance of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighting force from the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", who used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial art in the soft sand-prepared arena.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and one after the other sent his men into the ring for a heroic duel in different types of gladiator.
At first the "Provocators" were on their turn with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with breast shield, short sword and lance as well as an iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the performance of the "Retiarius", who with throwing net, trident and dagger started against the "Secutor" and after a short fight pushed the fellow to the ground.
The swords clashed metallically, the shields scraped, and the lances flew surreptitiously through the arena, which could be a fear and anguish for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, always had an attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era tangible," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organiser "Friends' Circle of the Roman Canal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city for one day, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage stated in his welcome address.
After all, the Romans not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of this were also to be admired at Roman Day, such as the "Aqueduct-Marmor" from the eleven-metre-high and 1400-metre-long Roman Canal Bridge, which once stood near Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society confronted the water and energy supply once and now, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of the past."
This is also confirmed by graduate surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Römervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the warm air heating that once heated the Römervilla.
Impressive are also the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the footsteps of clay before burning them.
In 2011, the Office of Natural History at the Landesverband Rheinland excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the commercial park Nord in Rheinbach.
They found perimeter walls of a farm building with a Darre for drying grain and for malting.
The building had probably belonged to a villa rustica, an agricultural estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations were presented in a glass showcase, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a petite necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, suspects Morscheiser.
The children also studied the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or, like the Roman students, wrote their names with metal handles on wax tablets.
At the booth of the Römerthermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, to make glass mosaics at the booth of the Rheinbach Glass Museum and to use a heavy stone wheat mill at the booth of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Centre to grind the flour for a flatbread or a muesli.
Visitors drove through the amusement park with the original Roman touring car, drawn by two cold-blooded travellers, passing the impressive stand of the Städtische Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the community of Wachtberg will also contribute to the Roman year 2014 proclaimed across the Rhineland, which is supposed to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the Heimat- und Geschichtsvereinen as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnershipsverein and the Laispielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes are offered and remind of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionnaire will tell about his work on the trainy Wachtberg, introduce plants as living monuments from the Roman era and offer a funny lesson in international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and drawn Romans.
The Adendorf primary school is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, often but no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be experienced again.
A small presentation in the Wachtberger Rathaus will commemorate the discovery of the Matron Shrine in Berkum in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemic Harms West Africa’s Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies go at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a major blow to West Africa’s economy.
The harvest rots in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets orphaned - the virus has severely damaged the region.
Some international companies are already at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," says Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is hardest hit
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola come onto the market.
Liberia is hit hardest by the virus, but here alone more than 600 people have fallen victim to the fever.
Recently, the health authorities declared that the disease had penetrated into every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people have already died, and thousands more have been infected.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries, companies are shutting down their operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, while several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers are also reacting: only a few merchants still leave their homes to get supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are quarantined, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export rot in the fields.
The farmers dare not leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert on the economy of West Africa.
The man, for example, who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population therefore gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is scarce.
In the markets, the supply of basic foodstuffs such as rice is dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, threatens to damage its image - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies will generally avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
The crucial factor is how far and how long the virus will continue to spread.
Investors could get the impression that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus also to invest," warns Hugon.
The disease also affects the damaged state budgets of the states
The disease also affects the already strained state budgets of the affected states.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be severely strained by the high expenditure on the health system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where so far only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Niger delta has not been affected so far.
But elsewhere, many people are already at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels also decline significantly.
Protects celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
The preparations for the 50-year founding festival from 12 to 14 September are in full swing at the Schützenverein Tannenwald.
A big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker" is planned on Friday, September 12th.
On Saturday at 6 p.m. is the big shooting.
Afterwards the evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam" is in the big tent.
Brass band provides the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festive divine service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the large procession at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of federal and Gauschießen.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festive ladies with their dirndls.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker took over the patronage.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment by means of practice in room shooting and small caliber shooting".
In 1937, the Nazi regime ordered the dissolution of the club.
It was only in 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who launched the "new" shooting club "Tannenwald" Berngau on 30 April in the Lukas inn.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club through a difficult beginning time, in which it was mainly about finding a club club and installing the shooting operation.
In the autumn of 1965, the Schützenverein started in the Gasthaus "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sport shooters, which were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
Rudi Meier reached the magic limit of 380 rings for the first time in 1980.
Just as the performance of active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
Since the club's local "Leininger" no longer meets the requirements of a modern shooting club, the board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future domicile in the cellars of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work period of 2700 hours, on 8 May 1988 Father Strasser gave the church blessing for the new shooting rooms.
One of the great highlights in the club's history was certainly the 44th gau shooting, connected with the solemn consecration of the new shooting flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994 the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A Böller group was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerers" and for the association as a whole was the organization of the Bavarian Böller Meeting in 2005.
In many hours of voluntary work last year, the members of the association modernized the rooms and the shooting range at the Berngauer Hof and brought them up to date with the latest technology.
Eleven teams in round competitions
The sporting achievements of the shooting club can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams are currently competing in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one sports pistol KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has risen from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the District League 1.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting sport, events such as goat stinging, carnival and king ball, club outing and Christmas party have tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivals in parish and parish.
Tony Stewart suffers accident on return to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the racetrack ended halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tire burst in lap 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said his team of 14 was disappointed, but is now focusing on the race in Richmond, Virginia next weekend.
"I wish we had had a better bet and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and we're hoping we can do better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier at the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went in today with quite good hopes for a good result," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tug and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver in an ash track race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or in the next race in Richmond to win a spot in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped on the road to confront Stewart during a race.
The authorities announced on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been taken as to whether Stewart should expect an indictment.
The three-time champion was greeted with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start in 12th position, Stewart had already entered the first 10 shortly afterwards and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in lap 122, Buschs
Car with number 18 out of control after exiting from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart drove on, but fell back to 21st place.
Looking for young people to dance
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and head Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to joining in.
Like many other clubs, jazz groups in TV Jahn have to cope with all-day classes at secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated.
Now more and more young people are wanted for a sport that is healthy and great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of eight- to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve- to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, on Thursdays between 5 and 6 p.m. or Fridays between 5 and 6.30 p.m. in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, you can taste the training lesson without obligation.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program," the trainer explains.
Afterwards, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore, classical music, sport and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, sociability is not too short.
"We also go to dinner, watch dance films and we have already stayed in the dance room," reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If you don't like jazz dancing, you can also get a taste of one of the other offers on TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always take part in classes on Wednesdays in the areas of children's dance/jazz dance, bambini ballet, videoclip dancing and hip-hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance on Monday and Wednesday.
Those who like discofox, slow waltzes, Viennese waltzes, rumba, cha-cha-cha and tango can come and join us.
Bulgarian Prison Guards Protest Nationwide
Hundreds of prison staff from all over Bulgaria have organised a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of demands to be discussed with the Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and are calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meeting between the union of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, reported the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR).
The negotiations continue, the Director General for the Implementation of Penalties, Rosen Zhelyazkov told the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the Union of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has given up Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine pro-Russian fighters continue to advance.
After heavy fighting, in which allegedly also Russian tank battalions were involved, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold Luhansk.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personnel consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the supreme army leadership without giving details.
Pro-Russian separatists fired a plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists reportedly shot down another fighter plane and two military helicopters.
According to Russian agencies, about 100 soldiers were injured or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region on Monday.
Ships sunk by the Coast Guard
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard in the Azov Sea for the first time.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships were under fire on Sunday near the port of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told the station 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had taken control of several villages in the Donetsk region.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
Today, the Ukraine Contact Group meets in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy from the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also take part.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to publicise their demand.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday that NATO adhered to the founding agreement of the 1997 NATO-Russia Council.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a gross breach" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," said Rasmussen.
Russian documents and statements show that "they see us as opponents".
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced its intention to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as necessary," said Rasmussen in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, said Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
A decision was still awaited by the European Union to send a representative to the talks.
Ukraine has not received fuel from Russia for weeks because of the dispute over the price of gas.
Finally, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supply for Europe.
Europe receives about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks the word of power: Toll will "get right"
Now the Chancellor has made a clear commitment to this.
But it's not a free letter for all the complicated details.
The CSU has become increasingly angry with persistent concerns from the CDU about the passenger car toll.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has, after persistent resistance from her CDU, spoken a word of power for the introduction of a passenger car toll.
"To be quite clear, it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU top committees in Berlin.
For the time being, however, Merkel did not commit herself to a detailed model.
In the black and red government programme, "certain parameters" are mentioned.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) had "made a proposal, and this is now being worked on".
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) also constructively contributed to the discussions for a draft law.
In addition to the topic, he also talked with Dobrindt about further possibilities to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, for example in broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it."Schäuble left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house testing its own concept to pay motorway investors with toll revenues - after the election in 2017.
CSU CEO Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the lead minister in the cabinet.
CDU Federal Vice-President Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed to toll all the county and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU country chairman.
In this respect, it was an important signal that Seehofer had now announced that he would speak again about the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU regional associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
There are concerns that tolls affect local border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded loyalty to the coalition because of the toll criticism from the ranks of the CDU.
The Left regards the plans as having failed in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," party leader Bernd Riexinger said to the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"The toll fails the minister." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which is due to start in 2016.
However, according to the coalition agreement, domestic car owners may not be additionally burdened.
Therefore, they are to receive a full compensation for the toll via the vehicle tax.
However, under EU law, the model must not discriminate against foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought, as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years, that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, unsafe gait and curved toes.
The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she'd be in a wheelchair before she turned 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell down all the time and everything lasted longer with me.
I could never skate or skateboard with the other children and was often teased at school because of my way of going and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library, and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and panicked terribly.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair when I was 18 and die when I was 25 and slowly lose all my skills in between.
I took it all out on my own and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities had not decreased as much as she had imagined and questioned her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you did, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair by now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, she was diagnosed with CMT.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworker since the closure of the former military training site
For almost ten years, the former military training ground in Münsingen has not been fired.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition still appears every month at the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere area.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up on site.
A deafening bang echoes over the heart of the biosphere area during the blasts.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was fired at the Münsingen military training site, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6500 hectare area has been the core of the Schwäbische Alb biosphere area, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated trails.
Tax burden on businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia area jointly paid $27.6 billion to government and local entities in 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over 2012 income of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of companies rose by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth following the several years of declining 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more strongly than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36% of Maryland's revenue comes from companies.
Virginia earns 28 percent of the lowest tax revenue from companies.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in real estate values of companies, the researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes of 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of these gains came from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the process seems to apply to the Washington area as well.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in government and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 – an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues, as real estate taxes amount to just over a fifth of corporate tax rulings.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the property, especially in the D.C. tax area, is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to be able to provide the same services that other countries offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also appear to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses does not rise evenly in all three places.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 per cent the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income tax (all three have fixed corporate tax rates) with 6 percent in all three departments.
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district at a relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that lower government and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and that the overall tax climate is better than in Maryland.
The study did not investigate the district.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of the state to up to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they are therefore paying more state and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transition structure that most small businesses are organized according to - in the District, Maryland and Virginia last year increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with a 6.2 percent increase in general VAT revenues for the state and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government's cut in spending had an impact on the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer brewed in Frankfurt's twin city of Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the official in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery were to settle in our city," said Li Yiwei, vice-party secretary of the South Chinese metropolis, when visiting a SPD delegation in his city this week.
Time and again, the official of the ruling Chinese Communist Party came back to this concern of the twelve million metropolis in the course of the conversation.
Guangzhou, also known as the canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, warb Li.
Therefore, people also have the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, promised the host that he would listen to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joie de vivre," he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This joie de vivre already radiated Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result, the official from Guangzhou toasted with shepherd's gümbel - but with red wine, which was served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
More business
A second wish of Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice Party leader Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again", the local politician was convinced.
"Business between our two cities continues to grow."
Currently, travelers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The authorities of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, are also hoping for a flight connection.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish to the fore in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," Schaefer-Gümbel replied - Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany, nodded in agreement.
Well-kept partnership
The leutsel deputy party leader of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He did not come into office until that year, after his predecessor was promoted out of office for allegations of corruption.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against party and administration corruption, which is harshly enforced by head of state Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the car manufacturer VW built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city twinnings.
The connection to Guangzhou, which is 9000 kilometres away, is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese association was celebrated.
With its economic power, the South Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse.
Next year she wants to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Family of Joan Rivers "wrote the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since she was admitted to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter today showed hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a message today.
We all keep our fingers crossed.
Her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency for cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious".
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
Cars and vacuum cleaners, which will be sold today, will be subject to stricter environmental standards in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from 1 September, where the buyer can see key data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars, stricter nitrogen oxide values apply in the pollutant class "Euro 6".
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolders: They receive a national minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (970 million US-$).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected to take over Twitch, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service was for a cool billion decided thing, and the collaboration also appeared naturally.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to release their bravourstücke in games, a "YouTube for live games", according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which Besserwisser gives the (mostly older) games a painting of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken a bit bored, a textbook example of an established technology company buying up a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn't happen, as the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon did.
All we know about this right now is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to exercise rather than watch, it's hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching others play instead of taking control consoles into their own hands.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3:00 in the morning as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something completely different to watch a weirdo shoot him in the head 20 times in Call of Duty.
All these games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete whole games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is not a play or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel is probably not that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It's hard to imagine Twitch being integrated into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have easily swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has something every company would like: thousands of young men courted as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallow - as spectator sport.
On Saturday there was a lot going on at the bouncy castle at the Burggartenfest.
The concept of the organizers was right.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Saltwedel l light and fun.
Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have made the name Amula out of two Spanish words.
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten should radiate brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was already evident on early Saturday, when the first visitors went to open air.
The organisers had promised a celebration for all generations.
And that's what they did.
Around the supply points on the Burggartenwiese, Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearby and wider surroundings, had made themselves comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, waved their feet in rhythm, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were on the agenda.
And that across the generations.
While some were mutilated on blankets on the extra-carrying white sand at the beach bar, others were lapping on a quarter of wine in the vinotheque, the offspring raged on the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when making children's make-up, the volunteers had their hands full in the truest sense of the word, in order to master the urge and conjure imaginative creations into the small faces.
The bigger ones used the kicker tables or took part in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel hosted.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 5:30 p.m., he fell down on the visitors, especially families looking for the vastness and dryness.
But this did not affect the attractiveness of the festival.
"More people came than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line."
Therefore, there is nothing against a repetition of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still has to be worked on, Sem made clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday against the popular voice.
He described it as annoying that in the meantime the admission had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little power.
As a result, some who had already paid for it did not come to the grounds.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedel co-organiser spoke of about 1200 visitors who were busy in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedel hip-hop band Blocks`n`Rox broke off their gig with annoyance.
The technicians were not able to create a reasonably sound.
The planned shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a tire breakdown.
"But next year they will be there," said the organiser.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful from the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will be forgiven the first time, but must be corrected in the second edition.
Also in the social network Facebook the organizers have to take criticism.
"Sorry, but you simply expected more for twelve euros," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you have taken over a bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems as close.
I think it is very good that some people not only talk stupidly, but also really try to put something on the table.
Hat off!", writes Stephanie Jenß to the amula.
Now the organisers have one year to turn off these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready-to-use component is waiting to be used in the striking structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the installation of the space observation radar TIRA, the hull, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new radom with a diameter of 47.5 meters will be slightly smaller than the old one.
But the size still remains a world record.
The last step to complete the new case is to replace the cap
The upper quarter of the old shell is cut off and removed with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new shell is put on.
As far as the weather is concerned, the action should take place at the beginning of this week.
Participants at the Ice Bucket Challenge Dislocated Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain screamed so much when her freezing water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge was painfully missed.
A woman was hospitalized after screaming so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did the deed, my jaw just stopped," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't work, the jaw was hooked, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw this, too, and were almost laughing in their pants, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was hospitalized to have her jaw reassessed after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Are the castle clubs going to pull together again soon?
Finally, there were always conflicts between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen.
Now the boards are thinking about a possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshaus Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshaus Burgfreunde, led the project in French Guédelon.
Just a year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and Burgfreunden Wolfratshausen.
Until now, the positions on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshaus Castle and possible reconstruction seemed very different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: discussions on a common approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the board members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit down once," reports Sjöberg.
In his view, all the members of both clubs could pull together again in the future.
This would result in visible results more quickly.
While the Burgfreunde around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had an eye on a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, for the castle club around Sjöberg the "opening and experiencing" of the site is at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased about the call according to his own information.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been in charge of the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the club activities rest out of respect." This "thinking phase" was necessary to "consider how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then go into the discussion with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfreunde could also create a current mood within their group.
There is currently no candidate for the Presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to "but very much like to continue to work on the project".
The different positions on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffl in the near future.
He honors Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, well-advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
By a high participation of the population as well as by volunteers from all over the world they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to push the project forward."A "all-adjustment feature" could be created for the rafter town.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, believes Piffl.
"I personally don't want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein will perhaps move a bit on this point.
Their goal of documenting history at first is "important and good".
After that, you could keep looking.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the fast-second-semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever saving idea.
He invented a loan system for books by students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the return sale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Keks," said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $ 430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management said that on average, students spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study material, but that there are various cost reduction options for the students.
Online stores and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Leasing textbooks is becoming more popular, so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, announced that the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in college bookstores were rented last spring semester, said Neebo's Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one-off for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books online cost only one third of the price they are available for in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buying Secondhand
If you don't mind the notes of other or normal usage, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second-hand issue of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was newly sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, advised students to ask their professors if previous editions were allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenses can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Leasing textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and you do not want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms and conditions of the business where you rent, including the penalties that may apply for writing notes, underlinings or signs of usage.
Pay attention to tenants: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books are also an option instead of traditional textbooks.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students often find the best offers in literature courses, as many classics can be downloaded free of charge nowadays, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
I'm sure you'll look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price determination of books, as you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering online, you should check, according to Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and finally paid the full price at the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a cashier
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone recorded less than $30 million in its $90 million budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only $12 million in its $70 million budget.
The film "Sex Tape", tailored to Cameron Diaz, only recorded $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children's films such as "Dragon Taming Easy 2" also disappoint in their revenue.
An article by the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that the lack of quality in the films themselves could be the reason for the children's films.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year ever" for children's films and described "dragon taming made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
For films for a slightly older target group, however, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer film launch that was shown between American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and on at least 2000 screens in the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are equivalent to last year's.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, currently working on Disney's upcoming jungle book film, told the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently generated revenues of $1.2 billion in streaming content, almost twice as much as last year, when sales amounted to $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for concentrating too much on filming comics and predicted a "core melt" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his bleak prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential box office hits expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simply "cyclic" and told Hollywood reporters, "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
A few years ago, when the 2nd table tennis district class was cancelled to streamline the league classification, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to the programme.
As a result, those who have not ascended have descended.
Although Göttingen's top-class team Torpedo has avoided the descent in the Oberliga-Relegation, it will only play fifth-class in the coming season.
Torpedo's ladies remain in fourth place, despite their grandiose march into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Niedersachsenliga, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo-Reserve are competing in the new Verbandsliga, no more Göttingen clubs are represented in the Landesliga.
The TTV Geismar plays for the ladies in the Verbandsliga, the Torpedo-second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new District Oberliga Süd.
This is where TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC compete.
In the district league, regional representatives Dransfeld and SC Weende play, in the district class of the TTC II, Rot-Weiß, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The district upper league of the ladies begins at least in set strength.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are part of the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the district league.
With nine teams each
SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Even the SCW-boys' district league relay - where Torpedo II is still starting - is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttinger Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the Western relay are the Rot-Weiß II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen, among others, play in the Eastern relay.
The Women's Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no women's teams at the county level.
It is striking that none of the six 2nd circuit classes achieves set strength, here the innovative and busy circuit board will have to think about.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the centre of Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed developments for us on the weekend and talked to demonstrators who travelled to Belgium from Bridgend.
Teenagers flown out of the Blue Mountains
TWO young bush walkers were brought to safety with the winch after being caught overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man set off for their tour in Govett's Leap in Blackheath shortly after Sunday noon.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when they had not returned home.
A search party from local police and rescue services broke out and the couple were found near the Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 11 p.m.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and had his head open.
Rescuers stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out Monday morning.
They were sent to Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition with an ambulance.
Escalating anti-government protests in Pakistan
The approximately 1000 demonstrators were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, said information minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The station has re-recorded the broadcast after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial office.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The demonstrators call for the resignation of the head of government, to whom they accuse electoral fraud.
The police reported that around one kilometer from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there had been clashes with security forces again on Monday.
According to hospital records, a policeman was injured.
At least three people had been killed and more than 500 injured during the weekend, when demonstrators tried to advance to Sharif's residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening, after a meeting in the Army Headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and without using force".
The communication also stated: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state".
The escalating violence has fueled concern about military intervention, which has been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to endure.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri spoke similarly.
Khan accuses Sharif of having won the parliamentary election last May through fraud.
Qadri demands the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are in action to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had initially remained peacefully in front of the parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to advance to Sharif's residence on the weekend.
Hütteldorfer finished third in the table after the second win of the season.
With the 2-0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday has come to an end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate low with the end of the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goal scorer Steffen Hofmann, who advanced to third place with green and white.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to the winning road Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second win of the season and goes into the international league break with a successful experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said defending champion Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory in the 14th minute with his magnificent leadership volleyball from the Sixteenereck.
"I thought I would blow all the frustration in from Thursday and put it under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a Bundesliga match on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, because I am from the young Rapid," said Schrammel.
Due to the short-term pool Blessing of Mario Pavelic Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and did his thing very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in a mirror.
He has earned the goal, he has already done some assists this year," Barisic praised.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2-0 by Hofmann after about an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have registered.
"Thank God we've been lucky today," noted Schrammel, who alluded to the clashing of performance and result in recent weeks: "The results didn't vote, but the playing was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that one was "better than today in many games before" - against "the strongest team that played in this stadium this season".
The first three points since 26 July have therefore proved that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
For him no less pleasing: "That we have finally played to zero again".
A lot of work during the international break Also the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger had several failures, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger made their starting debuts make the victory even more valuable.
"It must not be forgotten," warned Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately."
The national game break must therefore be used to "lick wounds and increase a bit in the physical area", said Barisic, who has five U21 selectors in his ranks.
Captain Hofmann is one who seems particularly interested in the break.
He's tearing himself apart for the team, he's getting hurt.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," said Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his replacement in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who made his 350th Bundesliga match, it was the first match out of the match since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "May not believe that everything is good now" "We have certainly also had a bit of luck, but at some point happiness must also come back to us.
Now it was high time," Hofmann said.
He, of course, urged concentrated further work: "You must not always see this in black and white.
We haven't played as badly in the last few weeks as it has been portrayed.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can help a lot right now.
They stick to me in certain phases," Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to blame for himself and his team.
He regretted the quick hit "from the category Magic Gate", as well as the regular goal of Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly cancelled by referee Kollegger.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that in some phases we were not sufficiently concrete towards the goal.
We've had too few degrees.
Inner defender Maximilian Karner looked like this: "It started very badly, but then we found it in and even made a goal.
On the whole, there would have been more in it.
Under this top of the hill there is rest
We showed a mighty tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series "Mein Stück vom Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the pictured specimen is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak tree.
It passes by couplings, basalt heaps and basalt seas.
A little bit below the quarry from Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vitally the natural monument looks like, it towers over the other trees of the surrounding area and with a circumference of over eight meters reminds of an American sequoia tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
Despite intensive research, however, there were only references to the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider specifically consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and asked older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what they were interested in.
The result of his research remained the fairly sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the herdsmen of goats were supposed to have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the hard cleared meadows and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animal keepers exhausted from the ascent are said to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because on the meadows, herds of goats are actually grazing again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has further discovered.
When entering the stone collections, however, one should exercise caution, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular abode for cross-otters.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is a bit hidden.
Further paths are signposted, climb up the direction Hochrhön and invite you to a long hike.
Where's the water castle?
However, a water castle, which is sought at our next task, is rarely to be found at altitude.
The reflection in the trench already gives a good impression of the building, but we have in the district some historical buildings, to which the building counterfei could fit.
Where's our Rhöner Glück?

After weeks of tug-of-war, Italy's Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the EU, Matteo Renzi, has won the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy against strong conservative opposition at the EU special summit last week.
Renzi, as the pro-government daily La Repubblica points out, considers the appeal of his Mogherini, who is also a favourite in the government team, to strengthen the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the left-wing party base, which repeatedly rebels against him, because Mogherini is assigned to it - albeit rather in a moderate way.
The conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and President-in-Office of the Council, Donald Tusk, will be faced with the prevailing opinion in Rome in order to strike a political balance.
The EU's chief diplomat will also become Vice-President Juncker.
The still pending approval of the EU Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is spreading optimism that Mogherini, who has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades and who is well known for her ambition, will be able to meet the "genuine challenges".
Born in Rome, she is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which in 2008 merged with the Catholic Centre Party Margherita to form today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
With the 2001 election to the Party Council of Left Democrats, she joined the high party politics, worked in the foreign policy department, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies of the NATO operation in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, maintained contacts with the social democrats in Europe and with the democrats in the USA.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as Minister of Foreign Affairs.
If today the PD again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent votes of the party in the EU elections in May, then Federica Mogherini, as noted in PD circles, has a share in it.
The reservations in Brussels that the new EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner has too little diplomatic experience, therefore lack substance, are countered in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, suspiciously realistic accents of Mogherinis on the crisis in Ukraine are being pursued and defamed as a "Russian-friendly course".
It supports the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe by bypassing Ukraine, which also serves to secure Italy’s energy.
After Renzi began his term as EU Chairman in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos that they showed with Putin at Shake-hands were taken with indignation in Brussels, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief to a Milan economic summit for October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an apprentice who has already completed another training in the company.
The new employees will be employed in four apprenticeships in the future: electronics (three apprentices), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All trainees come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended primary and secondary schools and secondary schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all ages as well as the instructors will travel to a team training event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the programme.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of trainees spread over all years is 27.
The Socialists in France were to "shut up and put France in order," said Francois Hollande's most important ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president whose cabinet reshuffle has met with disapproval from the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay by his side," he said with great applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite fierce demands for a relaxation of the regulation by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his fellow socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, spread sand in the gear, in which she appeared at a meeting of apostate socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking "the faith in their future" from the French.
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the socialists' constant trench struggles and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has none either, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will not survive autumn or winter either," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated her party's call for a dissolution of parliament and said that she was confident that she would be the winner in early elections and was ready for government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead in the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment figures.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must feel that things are changing quickly," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise operator, is leading advanced negotiations to acquire its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises luxury cruise ships and its wealthy customers, while competing with major rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo refused a comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues in 2013 amounted to $2.57 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion and is expected to grow in the coming years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
For these new customers, the companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises filed an IPO with the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino mixing group under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to regulatory authorities, Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and TPG Capital LP, a private equity company, at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises together have 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships according to the original application documents for Prestige Cruises' IPO.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A peking group waved the Chinese flag nearby.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be filled with peking loyal members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be admitted to the election and prompted pro-democracy activists to carry out their threat and paralyze Hong Kong's financial centre with Occupy Central protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China’s party leadership fears that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper in June on China’s dominance over Hong Kong, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business district and organised a sit-in.
Li's interrogation is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The deputy chairman of the Standing Committee Legal Commission, Zhang Rongshun, as well as the vice director of the Hong Kong Office of Affairs and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be questioned during the day.
Student activists announced that they would meet in the afternoon in front of the head office in Hong Kong.
Britain did not provide for any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin calls on Kiev to start "publicity talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media reports on Sunday, demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and start immediately with negotiations on the "statehood" of the apostate region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status vis-à-vis Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin’s appeal to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits in with the strategy he seems to have pursued since the beginning of the riots five months ago: helping the separatists to take possession of territories and putting pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossija region to become de facto independent for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with State TV channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the separatist-held areas of eastern Donetsk and Luhansk, which were captured in March and April, after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently called the occupied territory "Novorossiya" or "Neurorussia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 Oct. and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in the areas held by separatists, hope for peace talks in the near future are "caught in their illusions," reported Itar-Tass.
"We need to start extensive discussions immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership, in order to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, said Peskov.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman's clarification on the correction of Putin's "misinterpretation" underscored Russia's claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, in contrast to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annexing the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the pre-conflict period showed a broad majority for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats at international fora would give the regional governments in Ukraine power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus de facto giving the Kremlin control over an area that links the Russian territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, at his inauguration speech on 7 June, suggested that Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider additions to the Constitution, which would give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels accused of arming and incitement to Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing followed after another advance of the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took over control of Novoasovsk in a stroke, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to secure Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants located between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Porozhenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday and urged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are on the verge of a point where there is no turning back," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on any concrete actions, the leadership demanded a draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council reports in Kiev on Saturday.
The first, presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko announced on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal around Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger over hackers who probably stole nude pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who of the Hollywood A-promises.
The film city is upset after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence have appeared in a hacking scandal around celebrities on the Internet.
The hacker in charge probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star from "The Tribute of Panem" and superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Of the Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were allegedly also published due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
The noblest one who got engaged to Grecko last month said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news site that the hack was "shameful" and that those affected felt "injured."
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she lies up in a pool without.
Palmer's film works include "Love Is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the hacked pictures yesterday.
A representative of Lawrence told TMZ, "It's an abominable violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a cell phone is nothing but the sale of hardware."
From a purely legal point of view, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Bikers, joggers and hikers took part in the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg yesterday and supported the association "Help for children with cancer".
The tour, which was a torture for some, was an easy training for others.
However, everyone agreed in one: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberursel brewery yesterday rode his bike on the Feldberg.
For the good cause.
He can easily put away the small muscle soreness, especially since the participation in the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg in favor of the association "Hilfe für krebskranke Kinder" (Help for Children with Cancer) (Frankfurt) also personally brought him a valuable insight.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do it - great!"
Little break on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Upper Ursel city parliament, many of the 718 participants were tortured yesterday in early dew and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier for others to overcome the 11 km long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The green politician from the Kreistag - red dress, red bike - who appears in red did something else at the start on understatement ("A lot of pros, there's the finish!"), but then turned out to be half a pro on the mountain and went through the finish after 45 minutes without breathing difficulties.
He, too, went through the track in a slip, as did Nina Kuhn, press secretary of the city of Oberursel, who had set out together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we would like to be part of it - we would have made an exit today anyway," says Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning, and immediately afterwards he had to climb up again.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung into the saddle at 9 o'clock in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice, then roll home with fun.
I had fun with "Friten-Toni".
For the head of the Oberursel cult kiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg simply belong to it.
He had set out for 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racing bike.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I like being there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist".
He has to be, because he was on the "Fixie" bike, although they are racing bikes, but without gears...
Not only the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the Fox Dance to the summit proved that it was easy to go up without a bike, but also a jogger who pulled a car tyre with weights behind him on a cord.
Bergwacht doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who provided safety with his team, equipped with four-wheeler-Bully and Quad, said: "I know this one" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled trail, only that he pulls the sled himself." So the man is his own sled dog, so to speak.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - had been sent on the course in groups in the morning.
The walkers first at 9.30 am.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg", gave the start commandos and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year he hopes that it will be possible to block the route up to the Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
