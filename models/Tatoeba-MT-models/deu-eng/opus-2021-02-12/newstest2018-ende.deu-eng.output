Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
It's a crazy place where young people are supposed to meet today.
A crypt chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is now dug.
Small gardeners cultivate the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich reveals exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps aren't up-to-date.
Anyone who has ever had to get upset because the Auto-Navi displayed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlas, an offer of the geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but it is precisely for this reason that it is very instructive.
Especially if you compare them to current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the distribution area of Munich's Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bavaria Atlas is a patchwork carpet that is not recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called urposition sheets, have been included in the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian Surveying Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from Bavaria's first survey.
Your client, Napoleon.
The French military commander occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even if the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: it was the present-day neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive map of Bavaria.
Elector Max IV. Joseph pushed the project further, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek like all others.
The comparison in the past/today is most impressive by the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, as a Munich district.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was not named until 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwrittenly numbered hallway pieces from the so-called "original recording" from which the property tax was derived.
Small parcels no longer occupy farmers there - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sonne".
A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the venue of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt one reads in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße, people with delusions were once imprisoned.
In 1858/59 the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was created there.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Louis II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of the so-called madmen.
In addition, he has prohibited personnel from using violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked on the institution for an exhibition.
There had been room for 280 patients, later expanded to 500.
At some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, there is the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatry in Germany.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
To the west lies the football field of the TSV München Ost, east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in an architectural style based on the original construction of the asylum, which had been destroyed during bombings during the Second World War.
Marienplatz was listed as "Haupt Platz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs broke many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval crypt chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where the preparatory work took place these days and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn main line took place.
The slider can be used to compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and to fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Coloured People has issued a warning to colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to travel through the state and to exercise extreme caution, as a number of questionable race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," the group comments.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as state law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints at such a frequency that we have not heard yet."
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had run out of gas during his trip through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also notes a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General’s office showing that black drivers are being stopped 75 percent more often than whites in the state.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People have to be ready to bring bail money or let relatives know they're traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which rank the state 16th in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department to other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidezaunprojekt is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will be continued next year.
CDU MPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got a picture on site.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm, where he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides for 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Schwarzwaldmilch" is for him the alternativeless marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also chairman of the BLHV of Fischerbach, he described the Weidezaun project as "elementary important".
I can't make a profit on such steep areas.
The grassland area provides for a lot of work, much has to be processed with the engine sense.
"We are struggling with the conditions and topography here," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is happy about the Leader support".
Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of between EUR 3000 and 4000 per hectare.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while.
"The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how to continue their business," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticized for their support
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced in via the Weidezaunförderung.
The open area is therefore 40 hectares, which may not be afforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was supported by Leader, one quarter by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, farmers had to invest 12 610 euros in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is impossible".
Peter Weiß was also convinced: "Best food is produced here".
The Landschaftspflege Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state support for pasture fences.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the presence of a support backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the fenced-in area must not be manageable by towing (hanging over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build just under 16 kilometers of fence, is currently under way.
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares and the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now Trump’s White House is taking the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he had.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to his base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller insulted Acosta: "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your weary, your poor, / your distressed masses who long to breathe freely, / the miserable apostasy of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "elder waste" could be seen better on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who worked to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were doing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it back a long time ago.
The great screamer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not light the way to the United States."
Quite unusual, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.
It's literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.
And of course, that's not the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to kindle the hatred that is their only source of power.
2017 World Cup: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
UK Athletics Performance Director Neil Black says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the world championship squad will "make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017 which will start on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that the UK's athletics must learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," Black said.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m course, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team as team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Your captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, left the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in was great."
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes to date at the World Championships was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The mid-distance runner Muir is leading this way and has set five British and two European records last year.
She will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman who should be watched after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scotsman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots not only belong to the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, because we have a home world championship.
So it's really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Don't apply for a public office if you can't tolerate the burning of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scolded the critics, sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said: "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are led to slaughter like sheep."
This takes me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for this earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "So what?" .
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as the primary means of connecting with his constituents and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy to debut on his side.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum that is called official and employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The mail talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment section of the news programme "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, then some people tend to disregard it as a so-called collective effort and not as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "interference."
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in previous times if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of Loudoun County's Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers followed his lead.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected from the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, difference of opinion and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comforts in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led links to the final round in Archerfield last year before losing to Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how it achieves its fame with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course at its best, it is in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job fixing this place.
He is an avid advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"That really feels special," said the Southport based player.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on home ground.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.
I'm happy about the way things went."
With the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scotsmen on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, parking costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Less lung cancer deaths from passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew up his own 1994 study on this subject.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths per year due to passive smoking in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Domestic connections prove to be very complex
The construction work on Villinger Straße is in full swing and "is somewhat in time", according to the head of the building yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of the house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, since much is hidden in the underground, which is not indicated in the plans.
Traffic, which again and again hinders the construction work, is a major problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and barriers is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road was closed and only the regular buses were entitled to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already quite exhausting.
But fortunately, our friend Fritz Matt provided us with cool mineral water," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed with zealous, unwashed hands and swallowed.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, e.g. washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 pm," she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was admitted to Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public hand raising in front of the occupying forces.
An existing movement for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea forming the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is boring. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour car ride by car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and of corrugated steel roofs, which were converted by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst rates of infant mortality and literacy in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold country.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province of New Jersey with a population of 153,000.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined US$3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion worth of timber resources.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are mercilessly treated.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We Will Lose All," says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of last year's atrocities, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric shocks are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia's researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened as Papua's resources bring in an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but the demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables cheaper in the traditional market than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old native of Paniai, who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
"It has cost the native Papua - the mama mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address the inequalities and violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," you says.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuans, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in a circle and imitating a bird singing - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators started throwing stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated up, an order was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document by TIME that was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for rest and called on the crowd to return home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, only bears a name, the TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Chief Inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they were under attack.
"We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Papua Police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured.
The news about the killings only came to Jakarta 'filtered' the following day.
Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura for three weeks, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately, so it won't happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations, but there are processes that need to be gone through," he said.
Then Wiranto retreated when he spoke to TIME on June 5 in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity", who claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with fierce infidelity.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take a unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured people were brought here quickly, the TIME said.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army claiming to defend Papua's rights by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in recent years under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of range.
People here grow everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region tend to go to the more educated and prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribe council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting by international media remain tense.
Early this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's campaign promises to lift the restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's restless easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's allegations and said to journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and harassed him "We want freedom", according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shootings," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, regard their voice for Jokowi as a "guilt" that he has to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that justice may never come to them, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 79-story building, 337 meters high.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high-rise building in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and screaming people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident who gave his name to George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units at 4:00 local time (00.00 GMT) extinguished the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of skyscrapers around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the paneling, the exterior paneling for decoration or insulation.
In Britain, the police said they believe that the system of panels for insulation and cladding on the Grenfell Tower in London in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Association (ITF) failed with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-satz classics, which are often very long, but which are also very much appreciated for this reason, are thus preserved in traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the Member States voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was barely missed.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our memberships did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions," said Haggerty.
It would continue to work to improve the competition.
After many objections, the proposal that the final be held in a neutral place had not even been put to the vote.
Only comparatively smaller details will be new from 2018 onwards: the Davis Cup and Fed Cup finalists will have the right to host in the first round the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places etc. are facilitated and the players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers bring prohibited items to the plane, find out a survey
A survey of flight passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent entering the aircraft while carrying accidentally prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered late that they had been travelling mistakenly with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers rather disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they were knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7% were Millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were Generation X members.
The most common items that were deliberately smuggled past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane.
The company said it questioned travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled through airport security and how many deliberately did it.
It is no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through safety were the ones who fly most often.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain about which liquids they may take with them or how much of them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are banned liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA could look at books as contraband.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders
Electro-thousandsassa Elon Musk likes to list with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far neglected that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever triumphant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed for the first time a different, less glamorous figure in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk had frequently advertised the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these were only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation Tesla pays back the 1000 Euro (in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment" completely.
Currently, 455,000 such non-binding reservations were available, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla CEO does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could be a problem.
His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not the demand, but the production side.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it will be 500,000 - all models taken together - and one million by 2020.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, with maximum capacity utilization without major interruptions.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA CEO Pruitt withdraws due to delaying the Obama Era’s emission reduction rules
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama’s rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous post in a federal appeals court.
The deadline for states to comply with the 2015 ground-level ozone standards was 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid "interference in local decisions or hinder economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's Attorney General prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly resorted to blocking or delaying regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries are opposed to.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPO administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that its reversal of ozone standards simply reinforce the EPO's willingness to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Among previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others and, in an agreement, set the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and authority that exists to us."
Nevertheless, the EPO opinion stated that at some point Pruitt would use his "delayed authority and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules were "based on sound policy and the best available information".
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPO this week, said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
"The EPO's reversal - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is produced when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists cheered over Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the one responsible for protecting the air we breathe in," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological crusade to turn to polluters and their particular interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of the Church of St. Hilarius: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made Tumlingen's friends and supporters their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem".
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg document book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei on it" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 marks of silver.
According to the text of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a royal court to which the church or the patron saint's right belonged and not vice versa.
So there were also people living there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the village of Tumlingen today, the "mountain" was the third, the stately settlement of the village.
Old maps from around the year 1600 support these historical facts.
Patronage law arose from the early Middle Ages' own church law.
A gentleman who built a church, furnished it and occupied it with a pastor, remained the owner of this church and was also able to inherit this own church.
This involved the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The bigger one of the two bursts at Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later in World War II in 1942.
During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648), the windows were smashed and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hilarius was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's night in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower gnome that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kalllenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffigen Pensioners" maintain the Hilarius plant as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.
On Sunday, July 16, the Friends and Sponsors of Tumlingen invite to the sixth Serenade in the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle.
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local head Hartmut Romann speaks the closing words.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 p.m.
At the end of the serenade there is a drink in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest", the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The Serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to the care of their homeland, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines tested
"Boisheim defends itself" sees no legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim defends itself" has asked the Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind power plants could have been approved, since at that time in Viersen only at the city border to Schwalmtal a wind power concentration zone existed.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
Such zones are intended to prevent "sparing" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved this due to a formal error.
"Due to the lack of planning requirements, the approval decision granted is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim defends itself".
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the city council decided again on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "The granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is therefore prohibited under planning law".
The circle confirms receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the Viersen district since last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes them as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to lead to the end of the procedure.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the district did not want to comment on the content of the argumentation of the association "Boisheim freht sich".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which Viersen is indirectly involved, had already signed leases with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare site.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity demand of all Viersen households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash together: Woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two others were slightly injured.
The state road remained closed for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich travelled the L 333 in the direction of Bogel with her 53-year-old mother as an escort.
City and dealers plan "home shopping" weekends
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the inhabitants to shopping in the city center.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend is intended to raise customers' awareness of what offers the own city holds outside the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market, is therefore planned.
In addition, local companies with their training places are to present themselves.
In addition, the shops in the city centre should invite you to "shop midnight".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags, which point to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The trade association and the city are thus entering another stage of the "Attractive Downtown" project.
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the Brunnenfest, including Sunday open for sale, discussions with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials are to be new or re-exploited.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city centre while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help to revive the city centre - up to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network that had partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities will participate for the first time on the third "home shopping" day in Germany.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities", says Streich.
The action led by the IHK and with many partners also made it clear that every citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his or her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
During a gas explosion in Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others were injured, some of them severely.
According to the fire brigade, on Wednesday (local time) a wounded person was still in critical condition.
A person died when a part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A missing person was later also recovered dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of disaster, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump pressured Mexico to pay the border wall for leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president insulted him for publicly denouncing the wall, and reportedly said to him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that taking over a trade for the U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia is "laughing", "weary" and "stupid" and that the existence on the trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a "deep" after proposing a ban on the relocation of refugees to the U.S..
Mr. Trump ended the call after he told Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reintroduce Racial Lynchat as Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled towards the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped out to block its way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates were in fear.
"We want this n-- r Roger!" the man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams tore the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22nd, is just a reenactment.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience exuded very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one's ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really incredible that in all these years, not a single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in organizing the re-enactment.
"It's a stain on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want cessation, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We cannot attain healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A coroner puts a bedcloth over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch trial.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a ruling by the Supreme Court allowed the black people in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer primaries.
At about the same time as the election, black farmer Roger Malcom, according to the FBI, stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in town was that Hester had slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was wearing was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement that was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
"It was a right to vote massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual re-enactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is vivid, poignant and is based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe does not exist in America anymore.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we are then confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of blacks - rushed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-recorded overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director here.
He's been playing the role of Chief Clan for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like this," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to those times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom yelling at Hester and harassing him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n--he, get away from my property!"
Rascona returns the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs loudest.
"What?!" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said 'n--he' back then."
"Yes," joked one of the other black actors.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And that's where the energy in the room shifts, a sense of companionship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands above the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays' grieving eulogy "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred metres behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York to see the performance, many of them just come down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia's oppressive humidity for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you're standing on the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpses.
Children squat on their heads, register the fake blood and silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"You're not really dead," a little boy mutters as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynch rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience will sit down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chats excitedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about the feeling that the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... come from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me think that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today it's just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone holds Brooks' court at his table, eating and remembering civil rights.
He said he already started planning the performance next year.
"The reenactment is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like if we don't learn from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are doomed to repeat them."
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also relies on a colourful and frivolous production in front of a gigantic, six-story backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) features a shabby street corner with the rest of the wall and the Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-oldtimer parked in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - that runs through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drags a body into the trunk in Hollywood style and gives the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen, which is surrounded by the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later also Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who humbled himself and bowed his hands to the Merkel-Raute, are celebrated in a stormy manner.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in light of the great heat again in casual leisure clothes.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly awaited.
Five years later, he had had to pass a whistling concert in 2013, and there were big cheers in which the occasional "boo" shouts went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner was probably happy about this.
"You can see that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in a way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but had also grown an understanding of his point of view.
I'll draw a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at school all day.
What are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I'm dealing with different people, young people, refugees, young adults.
You're 26 years old now, so you're a late-time volunteer.
How come?
Men: I graduated from high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully dropped out.
I realized to myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing?
Make a social year, there's an insight, you can see what it really is on the ground, maybe in the focus.
And was it so?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I'm going to start my social studies in the winter semester.
I'm going to study dual, I'm probably doing a social worker training at the Herne Youth Service, and I'm studying at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.
Is it not a bit unusual to have several different locations during volunteering?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was just the right thing to do.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Different from studying civil engineering?
Menge: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of your head, each with a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, a youth who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any fear of contact?
Men: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson cuts a further 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive the business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring program was being launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
In addition to its previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs, the job cuts announced by Director General John Fallon for most of late 2018 and early 2019.
Pearson announced in May in a third cost reduction program a cost reduction plan of another 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) to revive a business that was taken by the rapid move towards digital learning.
The company, which sold its investment in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Kabul Convoi Attack: Nato Soldier Killed in Suicide Attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and one interpreter were injured, Nato explained.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last act of violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to a statement by NATO, the explosion occurred on Thursday evening, when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "person-worn improvised IED."
The statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and are being treated in the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack since the US-led forces displaced the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO reverses decision to delay the smog rule after actions
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to delay Obama’s administration’s regulation, requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
Late on Wednesday, the EPO announced the decision to advance the so-called "Ozon provisions 2015" and said it showed the Agency's obligation to cooperate with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners," said EPO CEO Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the EPO to delay the ozone regulations - where pollutant emissions are to be measured in part of the country in order to determine where cuts need to be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday saying that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
However, efforts have triggered the setback of Democrats and nature conservation groups, who are concerned about the impact of major emissions on public health.
The EPO website says that breathing air containing ozone can "reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Municipal council wants common area
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a common room in the future residential area for the elderly.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the still missing property is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take time for the area that previously belonged to the parish to be in the municipality's possession, there is now no longer any obstacle to planning the project to be taken by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a common area.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council propose to provide such a common space not only as a meeting place for the inhabitants of senior-right living, but open into the community.
As an example, the word "knit café" made the rounds.
The decision, which was already decided last autumn through the allocation of funds for the current budget, is being missed by funding opportunities.
The building is located in the rehabilitation area.
The establishment of a common area would be eligible, according to Tjaden, with 60 percent of 30 percent.
In order to signal to the investor that he does not want to be thrown between his legs in this respect, the proposal for a decision provides for the conclusion that both the saddle - which is based on the surrounding building - and the platform roof - which reduces the height of the gap and makes the construction more economical would be possible.
Unnecessary, not only does Wilfried Sohmer think this addition is necessary.
If it helps, he's going through the board unanimously.
It's not that easy with the common room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings of her own, with which one does not really make progress, but one now leans at the common room out of the window, she says: "I am difficult with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common area - but absolutely against municipal participation.
She sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because the acquisition of the land does not grant a grant, but instead receives a real, in case of doubt marketable countervalue, is the counter-talk.
Staiger's request to split up the proposed decision accordingly was supported by three.
So it remains with two votes against in the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we take the decision in this way, we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: cyclist is hurled on road
When crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was hit by a car and seriously injured on Wednesday in Garath.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on his bicycle on the road Schwarzer Weg coming from Hilden at 12:20.
The senior wanted to cross the road at Am Buchholzer Busch.
A passenger car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder went on the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the oncoming traffic.
He collided with a car driven by a 66-year-old Hilden.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a racing car.
FC Bayern Munich has to give up David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to skip the match against Dortmund.
FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season.
Seven pros are missing from the defending champion in the Supercup against the cup winner.
Before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 o'clock/ZDF and Eurosport) at Cup winner Borussia Dortmund, the personnel worries at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger.
In the duel with BVB, coach Carlo Ancelotti also has to give up David Alaba.
The Italian confirmed this on Friday.
In addition, Munich-based Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and lack of balance in his team's game for the five defeats in the past six test games.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good last time."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game".
The duel of the two German football heavyweights captivates the fans.
The match is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Wandering from star to star in the resin
The first "star path" is to be built in the Harz.
This is planned by the Verein Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many visitors to the Harz Mountains, it was said.
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
The members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well accessible installations in five to six locations" in the Upper Harz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber could be considered.
The information on the panels is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Star Path is to be expanded by train.
"On the Star Path, viewers learn a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines stronger than another, even though it is much further away.
It will also indicate in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to see it.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
According to the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, the location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy are often clearly visible to the naked eye.
In the Uni-Stadt there has been something similar to the planned Sternenwerg - the planetary path - since 2003 on the initiative of the association Planetarium Göttingen.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path leads with its steles up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (community of the same) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the endpoint - are positioned exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to reach the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
But the march to the next fixed star would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, went down the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organisation Super Springweight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday's showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I am a former featherweight," recalled Garcia.
"I went up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweights [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year in order to make a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who is also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23rd.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it," said Garcia and later openly expressed himself to fight on the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he might participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the triathlon champion from Riverside "looks very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off".
Garcia said the focus was to show impact strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that needs to be done.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four injured by tyre treader
In an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people were partially seriously injured.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira probably lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. shortly before the Marktbreit junction after a tyre seat.
The car hurled to the right into the embankment, where it rolled over and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour, then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Triad chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue will score points after the 2-2 start of the season against Braunschweig.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, and with the result, too, if it had not been for the two opponents in the 2:2 match against Braunschweig.
"These were two counter goals too much, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defensive player.
In the Erzgebirge, the triad chain will also be further optimised.
And a goal after a free kick also the fortunes no longer want to catch themselves.
"For the future, no one will stand on the line next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the chain of three, even after the experience in preparation, than with the chain of four.
"I still don't know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have players who can build up well in the three-way chain at the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite is, but that we harmonize even better and that we do not afford so many playback errors in the construction."
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can speak of a failed start after a draw, don't know.
The performance could be quite okay," Hoffmann said.
"But if we can stand there on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the trophy, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper season opening."
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I only assess the start of the season after six to eight match days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely due to a storm.
"Now they can practically start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascension favorite in their bones.
"But they don't know where they are currently," says Fortuna's internal defender.
The guests from the Rhineland go as an easy favorite on Sunday to the meeting in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we sweep them away just because we have the claim to be among the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There are no teams in the 2nd Bundesliga that have to be beaten from the start," explains Fortunas Chefcoach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish Asylum Age Evaluation Tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the persons tested are over 18 years of age, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started conducting the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they should make the assessment of the age more precise, after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migration Verket) was criticized for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age".
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results in recent months are consistent.
"We don't see a big difference in statistics over the past few months, the figures are quite constant," he said to the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases where the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "propose that the person under investigation is 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are taken, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they were going through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can," he told the Metro newspaper.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full on plan
The work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in Freiburg.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of renovation.
The end of construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the schedule is being adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete arched bridge covered with red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now grown into years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three structures are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red coloured sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning, which is 1.30 metres wide and weighs seven tonnes.
This is a border fastening, which is also used as a working path.
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path should run.
The special feature is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of pipes through the building in Lauterbach has required a special touch.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project by hand in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building of the building and the collection pond in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a single-lane traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully closed.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colourful protest at German potato salad
It doesn't happen so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, Linke) represented in the Volkaneifel district council belong to a broad alliance that peacefully shows the flag on that day, because the AfD invites in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the poster "great election campaign kick-off".
And well-known names bring to the start - like Alice Wedel, who together with Alexander Gauland is the leading duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September, and the deputy federal chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD-lers, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
It's a colorful picture that can be seen there.
And what Christa Karoli, Chair of the Forum One World and one of the leading organizers, is really happy: "Great how many people have come together here".
There is music and plenty of food, including a "primarily German potato salad that the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought it.
The police have summoned many officials to Gerolstein, showing their presence at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reported that he had made an effort for such an event and was awarded the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but there was a cancellation because there were not enough parking spaces because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes.
So the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event on the Rondell forecourt, he says: "This is the good right of people, the main thing is that it remains peaceful".
It also does: around 8 p.m., a band provides entertainment on the Rondell forecourt, in the Stadthalle various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the leading candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Wedel, and the deputy federal chairman Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but it is also time to clean up shortly after 9 pm.
The police can withdraw - no special occurrences.
Trumpet hits Trumpet
A rehearse with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli is available in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkanfolklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
Petkov is solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo trombone player with the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Thus Johann Sebastian Bach sounds as if in a new dress, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by jazz echo prize winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play mix into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core piece of the program was only premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more so: the Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," says Kristen Stewart openly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what's next?'"
The Hollywood star's best-known relationship was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who ended up falling apart bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I would have played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and seriously believed it.
So I've never been confused or hindered.
I just never liked not being taken seriously."
According to "Bang Showbiz", she suffered particularly during school days when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I was looking like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, 'Girl, be proud of yourself!'."
In particular, she does not like to explain her love life to the public: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some people call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself in front of the whole public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee made a statement saying, "The change of party from Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would stop us rather than work on making our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
The global leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be accepted back into the sport.
Russia's leader of athletics Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics that his country's banishment from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were caught away from gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015, after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told the reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has realized to itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is being redesigned."
Coe said he was also "rejoiced" that Russia would accept the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We have to do everything we can to normalize this situation in the coming months.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Championships in Athletics, which will start in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug testing is still insufficient and illegal trainers are still free to work, he told reporters in London after a talk at the IAAF Council.
Mourning act for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a funeral in Fritzlar in northern Hesse, around 1000 people of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali thought.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the still unexplained cause of the crash.
However, she described the two lost pilots as "the master of their subject".
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse were killed in West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlar Cathedral St. Peter on Thursday accompanied by a wake of the Bundeswehr.
At noon, only the family members in the church left.
After that, the funeral service began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as politicians.
Among them were Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Grieving guests laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the soldiers killed as "highly decorated" and experienced.
The chief of staff had also built up the flight operations of the Tiger fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also declared: "If this occupation could not avert the crash, no one would have been able to do so".
Minister von der Leyen did not show any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the operation was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information on this.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the royal house on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two of them.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the notice continued.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, it is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of his not being happy with his title.
After the accession of his wife Margrethe to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also took the title "Prinzgeschahl".
Since Henrik had not received the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself equal to his wife - even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokesman of the Danish royal family.
Where the final resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's been working for for the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, had met Margrethe in 1965 in London.
He worked at the French Embassy on the Thames.
During his later wife, the expressions of sympathy of the people always flown, Prince Henrik had a difficult position in his almost 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knit socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, who I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
That was two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil Wants Rapid New Election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the Landtag after the loss of the red-green majority in government, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday we spoke out in favour of the dissolution of Parliament.
Prior to this, the surprising resignation of a Green MEP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official date of the parliament election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Former Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained in Hanover on Friday.
CDU Group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to include them.
CDU and FDP thus have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Grüne 68 seats.
So far, the ratio has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thumler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the Landtag decides on its self-dissolution as soon as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its next steps on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the parliament withdraws confidence from the prime minister and elects a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be tested legally cleanly," said Thümler.
"You will discuss all the questions in peace when they are legally soundly examined."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but a bit curious".
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She described herself as a follower of black and green.
The Greens called on the apostate MPs to return their parliament.
"We assume, of course, that she will return her parliament mandate, which she has received via the green country list, with immediate effect," said the country's presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
Green Group leader Anja Piel said: "We very much regret the decision of Elke Twesten".
She had deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxon Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of Red Green," wrote the Federal Chief of Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag quickly re-elected.
The exit of Twesten costs the majority of Rot-Grün in Lower Saxony.
The politician "in her injured vanity and in her frustration put her personal interests before the welfare of the country", criticized SPD General Secretary Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony participates in this dirty intrigue and tries to make political capital out of it".
Lower Saxony's CDU Group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his MPs to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD's parliamentary group in the Bundestag, accused Twesten of falsifying the result of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD, but SPD and Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Interview with Agriculture Minister - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How did the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp.
The federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg batches on the consumer protection portal www.grossungsanwaltung.de.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at the moment, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the reconnaissance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economics?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the Länder since the concern of Germany became known.
All information and risk assessment is available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are marketable and safe to health.
If the maximum residue level of 0,005mg/kg for eggs is exceeded, they shall not be negotiable.
However, uncontaminated eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, the farms are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production plants are not directly responsible.
Rather, they must expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service providers.
As always, there are too few inspectors in case of emergency.
Is there only a lack of staff or of coherent competence?
It was precisely the official controls that uncovered the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the handing over to the public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may exist are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide complete information.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and transportable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The product has put manufacturers, retailers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be worked on consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and fully.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, because the governing organization that has supervised the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must counter with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred enormous debts in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the club’s debt to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher matter.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini fell into disfavor from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to work to deter excessive spending.
"Surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the proceeds for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million can be reported in the annual financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, hit PSG with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014/15 season remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues through companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates, UEFA would not accept this as a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come from payments made by the World Cup 2022 organizing committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 denied that Neymar would become a World Cup ambassador and that such a maneuver for UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.
The sanctions against PSG so far mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, told me on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association assumes that the turnover will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and she tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, of the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country owns an association, anything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced on-board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to come to a possible end: the airline is rewriting the order.
At the request of the news agency sda, Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" from Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the speaker.
Around 17 million small red and white chocolate tablets of 14 grams are distributed to passengers each year by flight attendants before landing.
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwestern Switzerland" to be 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: for a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to try to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate plates on board its flights since 2006.
Before Swiss signed a contract with Migros' daughter, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, had delivered the chocolate tablets.
Swiss introduced the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are spoiled with delicacies from Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class passengers snack Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey also distributes on the short distance, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Discus Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup finals
The three-time world champion fights for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup competition and could only watch the discus competition from the grandstand.
Also with the first attempt, Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters, qualified for the final match.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s grunge era (when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stiffening themselves to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they nevertheless managed the impossibility to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more by the watering can principle, including a riff on the stalker movies of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Rocks the Cradle").
At one point, a character browses through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates, and "a series of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-evil plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-done impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lower lip beard of "Singles", whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series, until it achieves what I assume as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the gang how they will attend the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to look at (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game of 'Find out the Voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.
Six long episodes drag on, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", who was edited to a lesser length, could deliver his agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food for a feast.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we do it even with our own recent history and their own.
Hit against drug mafia in the country
The police have managed to beat the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as reported by the public prosecutor's office in Konstanz on Friday.
15 defendants aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, the officials secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and hundreds of thousands of euros.
Two people were arrested during simultaneous raids in Italy.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two Italian suspects.
The two are therefore presumably delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were in action.
The members of the mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail.
Since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor's office in Konstanz has been investigating organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo, and the investigators of the Rottweil police had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, four officials from Palermo accompanied the large-scale operation.
The investigations focused mainly on Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is also likely to be the responsibility of the gang.
Weise complains of large gaps in the foreigner register
"Data of citizens who should not show up there": According to a report, the foreigner register in Germany has considerable shortcomings.
This leads to sometimes serious misdecisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to large gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "partially serious misdecisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warns in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
According to data, the register includes 10 million people of foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by about 600 immigration authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 have been found, "of people who are no longer alive for a long time, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register."
"Incorrect data input can significantly slow back processes," the report continues.
The statistics on people who are obliged to leave the country also cover EU citizens who do not have to leave the country.
However, such false allocations "led to a distorted debate about dealing with those who are subject to leave", it is thus stated in the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government seems to have begun to send refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy once they have entered from there.
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper therefore states that the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures "in relation to families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was virtually impossible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees are the responsibility of the EU state, which they reach first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
As a justification, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased considerably".
Italy provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send back refugees under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, spokesperson for domestic politics of the Left Group in the Bundestag, criticised this decision: "Families with children are threatening human rights violations of reception conditions and endangering the best interests of the child because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system".
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach was already made available to other people in the blood donation service.
At least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Above all Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his now 100 donations.
Traditionally, in the meeting of the municipal council, the community appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It's brilliant how our body is designed for this and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood for strangers, even unselfishly," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, head of the German Red Cross (DRK), because the canned foods are decomposed into their components.
So three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the DRK circuit leader.
Obviously, the change to the theatre a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger account for half as many, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter each contributed 500 milliliters of their life juice ten times.
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "low" when it maintains interest rates on family income in the midst of increasing pressure.
The Bank’s Monetary Committee’s (MPC) policy makers agreed to hold interest rates at 0.25% at 6-2, with fewer members aiming to increase this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But it signaled that interest rate hikes would become necessary in the coming years to curb Brexit-driven inflation, and it said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economic stimulus package issued a year after Brexit.
It will call for time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financing for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more under this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as the pressure on households' real income continues to burden consumption."
With regard to interest rates, it reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "something larger" extent than markets expect.
The markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "step by step" and "limited".
The downwardly adjusted growth forecasts of the Bank for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecasted in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
After these messages, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and fell by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
There is no change in the decision after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of an interest rate increase and GDP rose from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although the Bank is expected to recover slightly towards the end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases, as the tightening up first gets worse before it gets better.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" income loss in the coming years, but she added that wages will "clearly" recover at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods, due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the drop in interest rates to 0.25% last August, following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's last ruling on interest rates, the call for an interest rate increase had increased as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell last month from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the bank said this was expected and it will pick up again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overrun in relation to its 2% target was "complete" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders are clamoring for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals expire and the new mortgages close, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drugs 10,000 people
Patients will have access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September onwards after a fight before the High Court against the funding of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-occurrence pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after last year's Court of Appeal confirmed a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough medications in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted, adopted and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said, "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the progress of more than three decades in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said, "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at people in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people at high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will improve many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one at risk of HIV will be left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people infected with HIV."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help to bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society'.
Living the Great Life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment at Earl's Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the spacious ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot-high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which to stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steelworks are quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, it was about setting up the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function at the top or at the bottom."
This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms in full height on top of each other - with a lot of extra drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window by Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
Through the perception of a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went into it," explains Erfan of the steel-enhanced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it glides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the base - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time to use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can turn into something quite amazing through good design and increased square meters of something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are in a dispute over one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the family founded Westco Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the Brunswick and Sorrento development areas, the Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one third.
A court record states that this means that Colin owns $316 million worth of property and Paul owns $176 million worth of property.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and both-sided law firms.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first denim shop.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little kid (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their property to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, where Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke 26 million upon leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark have become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation, Paul says.
Colin has been very restrained, although he was a former AFL board member and, after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by text to say "I really can't say much" because the case is in the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution."
This hope seemed to be over on Friday.
"Our case will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports, in the hope of keeping the head on a more even course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior staff on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that falls into the hands of the President.
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV commercials are still strong.
"If candidate Trump was annoyed by unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from posts that were convincing," former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a steady praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know to others - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more explosives without their intervention.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his associates have managed to keep trouble away from him several times, their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that might promote their views of the world.
Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisors to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he gets stuck to find out where they came from.
That's what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter because of harassment, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence, or that he had made false accusations and revoked them in the past.
Trump read the article and started to question employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did that work out?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped for.
The police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted criminals are by their very nature not known, information from the population is hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday about the action following the winter EU Most Wanted Advent Calendar.
According to Europol, experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations.
21 postcards have been compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
Thirty-six of the online seekers have been arrested, at least eleven of them due to post-publication references on the website.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'Millionaires Series'
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are back on the ground with some determined travelers who have negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
The travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the "millionaires series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a trench dug out by the Council to prevent their invasions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unimpeded to find a way.
Angry residents have urged the Council of Solihull, which said that it is "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday night, after being sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The Council must be forced to put into practice by shame, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back again.
More arrived last night, probably even more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by giving long instruction to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my community tax if the council can't even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be called said, "It's ridiculous, we've just seen the last round of these travelers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area."
A spokeswoman of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihulls police, taking the necessary legal steps to ensure that they move on as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost and income from the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation to the Landratsamt in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district, causing controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a development plan in order to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision at the time was not undisputed in the council.
But above all Freudenstadt's Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke already at that time of serious interested parties at the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it into a three-star plus category house under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, building debris containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should become "beautiful close to the citizen" later, as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
The facilities include a swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room.
One does not want to position oneself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an elevated inner city level, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide, explains Scherer further.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He had already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The ideas of the city were identical with those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly.
Just under a million euros, he reckons.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace is built in a courtyard, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudestadt is a good market".
Russia affair: US Special Investigator deploys Grand Jury
According to a report, Special Investigator Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump.
The board had begun work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper considered the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
The broadcaster CNN reported that there were already initial subpoenas of the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence has long accused the Kremlin of interfering specifically in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation should focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republican in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also looked at more and more Trump's private and business environment.
A few weeks ago, the Washington Post wrote that special investigator Trump had put himself at the centre and investigated the accusation that the president might have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Juries is to examine available evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether to file charges.
Grand juries are therefore also called prosecution chambers.
Most of the time, they are activated when they are larger and controversial.
The procedure is always behind closed doors.
The panel may also be consulted by the Public Prosecutor's Office to subpoena persons for interrogation under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign leader Paul Manafort were also present at the meeting.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on U.S. television that the appointment showed that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he would want to act quickly.
However, it does not necessarily have to be said that the Grand Jury will be called in at the end to decide on the imposition of an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The history of Russia is a complete invention," Trump said.
The issue gives the Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about".
His special adviser, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But these also usually work in secret, he stressed.
The White House supports any measures that have accelerated the work of the Special Investigator in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that there was no investigation against the president.
There was no reason to believe that this had changed, the statement went on.
But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this expulsion, accusations against Trump had become loud that he had wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey testified to a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his staff.
This led to speculation as to whether Trump wanted to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent Congressional Special Investigator, such as the Watergate affair surrounding Richard Nixon, who was later resigned, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the urging of the President.
However, several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, according to which the Special Investigator could no longer be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drifts in Antarctica
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has been removed from the ice shelf.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The Colossus, which weighs over a trillion tons and measures 5,800 square kilometers, is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
A danger to humans does not come from him.
According to researchers, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear.
In total, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now aborted colossus was a part of the Larsen-C shelf ice until now.
Ice shelf swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off.
The Larsen-C Ice Shelf is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this shelf ice was disturbed the balance of growth and abortion several years ago.
A complete ice shelf has decayed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen-C ice shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it currently is.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can decay if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of ice shelf ice and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it results after melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen C Ice Shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks off regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary from Swansea University.
"This is the furthest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists it is controversial whether the Larsen-C shelf ice will now grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say that it will be less stable".
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades a large number of ice sledges in the Antarctic Peninsula have decomposed.
This long tip of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice surface has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature had contributed to the decline.
In the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by about three degrees and is thus one of the areas in which the temperature rises fastest.
CDU wants home rate with staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU demands to withdraw from the employers' association in order to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break, the district council waved through 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first working day over.
The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously very sought after.
Around 620 applications were received for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 vacant posts in the district of Mettmann.
Doctors and engineers as well as general administration staff are sought.
The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the Kreistag and to counter the shortage of skilled personnel in the administration.
At the request of the parties, the administration is to "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counter the shortage of applicants in the future, it is said.
The overall concept should be oriented both internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-country entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were not known before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The talk is of a veritable "competition of public employers".
In addition, there are a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
High time to act, so that no more posts remain vacant.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the CDU's political group, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a fist-thick surprise in the district council when he publicly questioned the staff cost cap and astounded the other parties.
Peoples want to be checked for all the possibilities that make it possible to leave the local employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration should seek a home tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the district-affiliated cities," according to Völker.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and civil servants better than is actually provided for in the public service tariff system.
Salaries are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy tightens the tone for NGO migrants rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to do so if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organization 'Jugend Rettet' because their crew had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been operating for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone right now," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the accusations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is assumed that his crew will take on board dinghy migrants, who will be delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting was allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the authority of the Italian Coast Guard to oversee rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motive.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MEAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not entail any "essential changes or obstacles" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
There followed vantage points, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Palatinate forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the vantage point lined up at the vantage point, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days many meters of altitude were again announced.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing brine in the open-air inhaler.
Neustadt was also driven.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had got to know the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sport
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting over the stadium lawn sweaty in the wind and weather?
The fact is: E-sport has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees.
This is also recognized by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
The start was made in 2015 by VfL Wolfsburg, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire very new young target groups for the VfB," says Jochen Röttgermann, Executive Board member.
He is sure "that there are still many clubs on this train".
Next weekend, FIFA will be organizing the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where gamers from different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, so that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, you could be present on these markets much more often online than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is this about?
Computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA are fought at the competition level.
As in normal sport, leagues have long been established in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is this a real sport at all?
For many, the idea certainly needs getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid responsiveness are needed.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classic sports.
The scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sports.
Players are travelling internationally, it's like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by management consultancy Deloitte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros had thus been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
This is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.
However, e-sports is "not far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte advisors write.
Internationally, many countries are already further away.
Big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports has been introduced as a teaching subject, says Froboöse.
In the Netherlands and France, Dutt states that the football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"Germany lags behind in the European comparison," explains VfB Executive Board member Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to glorify the old times, is no longer enough.
The aim was to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dutt.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only in football everything stays the way it always was."
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are now affected by the scandal over poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and took all the eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been proven to contain no fipronil are to be placed on the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of the lyrics that drive Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years suspended.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who killed himself on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and eyes facing down when she was sentenced.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance that they completely regret."
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said that he had not found out that her "age or degree of maturity, or even her mental illness, had a significant influence on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying that there is "no day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pain that we will carry with us for eternity," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "followed" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"To no longer have the only person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's textual communications revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention from Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case through some press.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
One of the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lam of FC Bayern
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to compete in the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation does not hurt.
There was something different in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even if the additional garment was very, very small.
But as there was of course no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer to be seen on the second day of the Audi Cup, he stopped the bandage he had assigned to him.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the Confed Cup winner afterwards, after his first assignment as captain of Bavaria.
Well, the start could have been better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But Kimmich was able to interpret the sign from the coach as well.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a game leader in the C-Elf, consisting of youth players, debutants and just out of vacation professionals, but he had been chosen.
Zuckerl is best distributed to those to whom you trust a lot, who you want to keep in the mood.
So anyone who has been chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old ran across the field as a mini-lam.
Right back, that's his position now, the white bandage on the arm did its rest.
And in general Kimmich worked in this starting formation like the one who is best able to take the rudder into his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unrehearsed force.
He had the view for the whole, while many others were occupied with themselves.
Vidal playing over his lack of fitness (slowly clapped); Renato Sanches playing on the devil's way to build on the achievements of the Asia trip (slowly clapped); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle not to be negatively noticed in their first appearance in the Bavarian jersey.
After all, that worked out quite well.
Süle ran up next to Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acting sovereignly.
The Napoli storm, which was occupied by the name, was often difficult, and Süle also tried to build up the game a few times successfully.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not the way we hoped it would be".
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Game shift, tempo change: "For this style I was also brought".
How unusual this world of Bavaria is still for the new arrivals, one saw in the aftermath of the match.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but certainly six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
At Bayern you simply have to win every game".
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new guy that anymore.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's best-known footballer has signed up on Twitter just before the match and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian legionary is basically a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and is feverish with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational injection.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bavarian dusel.
Companies satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economics praises Wissing's pace
It often became irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This can be seen after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Trier Business Association (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has blocked."
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry is hoping for a plan approval procedure, and the construction law is expected to be in place by 2021.
The western bypass of Trier, which is in the prime need of the federal transport infrastructure plan, also plays a role in the country's plans.
The aim is to put the line into operation in December 2020, says Secretary of State Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
As suggested by Wissing, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier aims to create a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports, which have been falling for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, the IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new Master Bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is foreseen for the master's examination and 2500 euros if graduates set up their own business within ten years of their master's training.
But the homework list for the country remains long.
With the planned road construction, facts are to be created quickly, at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Managing Director of the IHK Trier.
Out of 56 new engineers, who want to hire Wissing at the Landesbetrieb Mobility, only 29 positions have been filled.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Baldauf refers to the Court of Auditors' calculations that the country invests more than EUR 20 million less in the preservation of national roads in 2017 and 2018.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country, how it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The current broadband expansion in the country is also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies only rated the grid supply in an IHK survey with a grade of 3.4.
They complained about stagnant Internet connections and disruptions.
Former Minister of Economy Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where, after four months, it cleared the field again due to disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company felt that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the enterprises as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to car manufacturers of installing systems to neutralise exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coagulating the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the faults of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices, in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested but drive back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emission regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could put a heavy burden on Volkswagen: the luxury automobile manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to participate, tomorrow Saturday a raft will travel through Munich, which has a special message.
If it pulls again to the Isar on Saturday, that will see there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke a large raft.
And it's not a common raft with Isar tourists.
It's the building department that wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large info transparent.
It shows a pile of garbage.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ..." the understanding of the Isar is to sharpen as a protected wild river.
Last summer, the raft crossed the Isar River and this year, too, there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo's tuber nose and the laughter against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most widely published cartoon artists, the tuber noses of his characters are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentinean still draws and works on a film.
His message: "Laugh, because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants.
In his first years as an artist, he worked out, among other things, as a draughtsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After working in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures roam around in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own data, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and watches, his droll figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is scheduled to appear on the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
Therefore, he rather relies on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence Threatened by Climate Change
It has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-like conditions and diseases-borne insects, which is causing great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil attracts not only holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
Solutions to be considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
This Saturday and Sunday is the highlight of the festival with a medieval festival.
Traders, guilds, traders, vagants or a Landsknechtlager are to be experienced in the city centre on these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The Riodoke weekly usually meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent Sinaloa state chaos through organized crime, corrupt officials, and unceasing drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies are piling up all over the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year.
Among the latter is their editor and inspiration of Riodoke, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists rarely bring murderers to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating Sinaloa's violence, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little use, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we don't trust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated "Twelve River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors tend to fly freely around Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot in the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, which are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after seizing another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars of shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to practice journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for brave and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He volunteered to admit that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you're playing dumb.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead people ... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the joker who could curse like a dock worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He'd always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across the street from the office, and sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his ruin?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "sorry a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, no mobile phones were allowed. Days before, it was announced that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 degrees C) in the shade of a tree.
They were tasked by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half joking, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's issue, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending, which focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the DA's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled all political levels almost the whole century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military robbery.
Only a few months earlier, the readers would have regarded the column of Valdez as the best-informed source of the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of its slender body structure.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The Valdez office has been converted into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they themselves would never have expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and the next morning went to a demonstration for another journalist to the DA's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered, and officials say it's his, based on DNA tests.
Journalists throughout the country have become louder by writing "SOS Press" in organized protests on sidewalks and buildings.
On that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed because they were telling the truth.
Since then, she has asked that she be re-assigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces involved in organized crime.
Last year, the media watchdog group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to shut up," Ramirez said.
Apparently, the murders have a deterrent effect.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas Cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Riodoke sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all of them started humming their phones.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.
From the curb edge, they published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens cried out nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the policemen who were holding the guard to see if they were on standby.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to Sinaloa, the Riodoce employees followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," said Bojorquez, "when the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street for coverage."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "disturbed past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described it as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years exposing the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of earth clumps.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink your eyes a little, you could almost believe it was sleeping," said lead author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this herbivore, although covered with armor and similar to a walking tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-shading that is also used by many modern animals.
This would have made it possible to mingle better in its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered counter-shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its base.
Although the shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today's animals.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use counter-shading -- think of deer, zebras, or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for evidence of his life, including his preserved intestinal contents, to find out what he ate as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but it is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you just squint with your eyes a little, you might almost believe that he's sleeping."
The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, passed through the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk in the sea and mummified in the mud after death.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from snout to hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long spikes protruding from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herbivore was washed through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail.
The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as 'rare as a profit in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right forefoot is at his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole.
In the thunderstorm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car pile.
There are many injured, miles of traffic jams and gaffs.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) about 20 people were injured in a mass car crash on late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, about 5 p.m. between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were crashed into each other.
At first, no information was available on the exact number of casualties.
They were minor to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backlog of about ten kilometres was formed.
As one AZ reporter reports, massive obstacles also occurred on the opposite lane - through numerous gaffs.
The fire department noted the registration numbers of the vehicle drivers, which now have to expect sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 6:45 p.m., a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There had been a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene of the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: you sit on the train and sleep with no idea of anything.
Or you are absorbed in your work and just have a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
Comes the conductor and wakes up an unsightly or rips the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your place and with it devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"When the offer comes up, let's expand it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said a rail spokesman.
"Comfort Check-in" is what the railway calls the ticket depreciation without a conductor.
However, in order to be able to use these, some prerequisites must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which most passengers already do.
You also need to have it purchased via the train app DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you get on the train, call your ticket under "My tickets".
At the test customers a button for electronic evaluation will appear.
Train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant arrives in place Y at the ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can go on sleeping, you can keep working, you can keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendants, simply check in yourself in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board member of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often travel by train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are one of the biggest troubles.
Because often, but in any case, one of the passengers does not have all the documents that you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the ID card is missing or another document you have to show.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to poor atmosphere in the compartment or large area and delays in controlling your own ticket and takes the conductor the time at the end to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question, "Whoes Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis-born girl sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone in high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," they said.
Confused, since no one else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out on the street and would remain there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She dropped off her phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and a man claiming to be Brown's father wearing a sign saying, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed of a policeman standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman unlocked his rifle and shouted, "I will kill you... animals all."
"It's not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This isn't the kind of murder we've gotten used to and we can call typical."
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and cried."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from 11 May.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resistance, which consists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, they discussed a conversation that they had "about the black experience and the black state" countless times before this morning.
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her with me," Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be brought up in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and constitution and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman-child.
I have the feeling that I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first stop, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment by Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism has totally changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of?"
This skepticism was fuelled by countless cases of people, often whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already collaborated with then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field who is known for his activism around death row inmates.
His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, followed by the team of Whos Streets, along with six other locals, in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or with us. We're talking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, as these people are portrayed, because that is how I will be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whoes Streets?" surprisingly show personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, coined the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who shook up that energy," she said.
"It's no coincidence, even though she was in the front line, because in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman so much is at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21⁄2 years because of the blockage of a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos".
However, she clings to a song and feels committed to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "dream" to "magic": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people even though it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The subject hardly leaves one cold.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Brown no man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Great madness!" (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters are building on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, which also benefits the other shops, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the Bauernmarkthalle stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the beginning of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - namely to Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying almost weekly in the Bauernmarkthalle for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always very much like.
We have also discovered the butcher's shop for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
There are also other cities.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the rent.
But this is probably not exactly low for the new project."
Eva Kilic: "What are shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this unnecessary.
There's already enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved for us.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no more special deals and what is left of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping center with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the Bauernmarkthalle go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost Bit-Galerie manage to expel all shops from Bitburg before?"
George Marquet: "This just won't work.
And no one needs a shopping center that's empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers' market instead of this gallery.
But there is no room for a farmer's market hall anymore thanks to the insanely many - I think - senseless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmer's market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York you can see many faces - white, black and brown, which almost imperceptibly resemble each other - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek tuppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after making public classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemplance (A Matching Similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans-woman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits of what someone could look like with these genomic data, has created a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the malleability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud, and theft.
Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits in a driver's seat and wears a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stumps and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained in a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal pen pals who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book "Suppressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would transform Chelsea's judgment and would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas just a few days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he was supposed to resolve.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name has a heart) called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's highly developed scientific encyclopedia) how amazingly similar, at least biologically, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also on view.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novelle.
She shows Manning how she shows up with a hands-free phone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong.
"If they colden your speech, they won," they say.
"So don't ever shut up."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets her from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulac that gather together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 " 2, Manning's stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind its liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford wanted for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, who are wanted as suspects after a man was stabbed with fatal injuries in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, warrants for murder were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the Cook County District Court records.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several engravings.
A community alert system published by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27th.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives investigate the stings as murder, while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now on leave of absence and was excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal case being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesperson from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. investigation agencies in any way we can."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to confront the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27th.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management team at Grand Plaza published a statement to residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim, exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA road map in the near future" - Russian Vice Premier Mutko
Russian vice-president Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) were implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the Roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap for compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, approved by WADA, into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit something that does not exist."
Mutko's words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," added Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded from carrying out doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the course of the doping scandal by WADA.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Aldi no longer sells eggs
This was announced by the groups of companies.
It was a mere precaution that no health impairment could be assumed to continue, according to the Communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to have been tested negatively for anti-lying fipronil.
Aldi wanted to create clarity and transparency for his customers.
The start-ups that will help your business not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employees' happiness in your e-commerce start-up, but the polls didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or, worse still, deceptive.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the trial.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She called for help from outside.
A new race of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employee anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track their health, but where is Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that they gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can re-search why.
Companies are coming to realize that you need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so that you don't become the next Uber to be involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118,7 billion in value by 2020, according to the financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convergence, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity early this year in the midst of the Uber case in discredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Chief Executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and lawsuits, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of employment experience," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations of the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that they couldn't prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in February financing from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitters secured $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and brought its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only deployments.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong, and that the work they do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are committed and committed.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and commitment, it's no wonder you'll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on its way.
And if the change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you're asking for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Kotter International, a business management company that has seen companies that rely too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Did you really hear me?
Will you take care of it?
And if you don't care, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, Errett said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is constantly gaining new insights into employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bond of employees in an industry that is known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It's 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players talk on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have taken off their jersey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the finale on Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of UCLA should start at 19:15, in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and performed practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to do 18 exercises in the course of August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their opening match against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the NCAA rule change, even if it added another point to the players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they keep pounding, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of vision of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the upscale class that has already been thrown with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a gate post.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"That's a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust to record an exercise there.
If you have the video tape from an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third-party factual reviewers and then display their results under the original post, said the world’s largest online social network on Thursday. It’s one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to fact reviewers who may display results of fact check from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for fake news, many of which believe they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany is supporting a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as they did before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook said that a test of the new fact check would be launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to finding out what stories are being challenged by third party fact reviewers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its feature on the "related article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic book novel: a castle in the history of England
In his recent past, little Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were there.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I overrated my welcome a little") this all seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust was not fully accessible until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said, "Oh, throw it in the attic."
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "One might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that two families fought for.
Guys, let everything go its way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred at the castle in 1380 in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe they're connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', which depicts the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Scotney's Rhodes' favorite family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, always making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys with a talent to advertise heiresses."
After the end of his assignment in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has made a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with fucking life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf
With the covering of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday for the introduction of a new umbrella brand (Thursday round show).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, the highlight of the campaign will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too good for us.
Or?", the makers of the action have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf Chapel.
"We don't really think that (of course!)", they write on their website, which was unlocked yesterday.
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
Basically, we firmly believe that, as Bad Honnefer citizens, we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"It is important to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling point."
Finally, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new umbrella brand and campaign an average five-digit amount.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) in Ankara advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as it used to be, but in the Prime Minister's headquarters.
The five Vice-Premiers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Head of Government.
Thus, the civilians in the YAS were outnumbered.
The government attracts the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt.
Against 486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt, negotiations have been going on in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the coup Erdogan had described the attempt to overthrow as a "God's gift", as he gave him the opportunity to "cleanse" the armed forces completely.
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unbehagen im Militär-Hauptquartier".
In the General Staff there were concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, were manifesting itself in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
The big cleanup in the army and the security forces is still going on.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7395 state servants fired by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan tamed the military.
The generals were formerly considered to be the real masters of the country.
Three times they coupped in reference to their role as guardians of the worldly order of the state.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least by relying on the European Union's reform guidelines.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately pushing forward an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the "Vocal Europe" magazine, an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, after the purges, there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army to intervene in the alliance.
The leadership structures and operational skills are "weak," say Nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for a reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the US spends green cards on citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump said, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renovate track for Rennsteigshuttle
Over and over again in the past months the future of the Rennsteig shuttle had been disputed - now it should go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, the tourist railway will be built on the barren route.
According to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the track will start this year in order to secure the long-term future of the Rennsteig shuttle.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, which is particularly important for tourism," explained Klaus Sühl, State Secretary for Transport, in Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of repairing the line was estimated at around 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalized, explained Sühl.
The Ministry and Südthüringen Bahn as operators were already in agreement on the technical details.
"This means that the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
The Rennsteig shuttle should be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a railway connection between Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, which is particularly popular among tourists.
In the past few months, a pilot operation had tested whether the route would be used by a sufficient number of people to order it regularly again in the future.
The track is also in parts seriously dilapidated.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just when you thought it couldn't get any crazier in 2017, comes a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking her rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but the companies are delivering a lot of them, and we will see them even more often," said Mr. Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm – with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything, from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it gets even more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventure" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible," enthuses True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation, or she can be "in mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one takes a step towards Frigid (meaning here: reluctant) Farrah, most alarm you.
On his website True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, then why can men not have Roxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not be holding sex robots, and as the FRR notes its increasing popularity, they remain on the edge of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks out of the fringes can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who boasted of having sexually assaulted women.
The most deterrent aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Handmaid') is not the graphic images, the swallowed-up bodies and the pierced eyes, but how realistic this vision looks.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as possible (although with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, put to the point, when it comes to their "personalities", the robots are not real women.
They can't separate from their companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to put it in the way of speech of 2017: maids
Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also divided families in small format.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-chosen relatives.
We're all supposed to try to burst our filter bubbles.
Less has been noticed the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she had fought with for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite strangely on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I notice in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that his kittens will not repel us one day.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans, who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to his standards.
Today, I find myself infested by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, are indeed a very mild crime.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York park section, and the best three dollars you can spend in town if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climpering music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in northern London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a strangely magical experience, as two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go there and have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given it the full score, but fortunately no one asked.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street, it's the same thing, plus the option of matching the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood smiling, apologizingly, while I was tired of the experience of handing her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which he suffered after a case in his cell, according to the prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first manslaughter sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a toilet cabin door in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth-graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and secondary schools.
Three of the students go to secondary school in the future, four to secondary school.
Head teacher Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
The 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle as a symbol for the school's release from school.
In addition, the lively band performed a musical entitled "Der Adler im Hühnenhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and let his chickens hatch it.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken was broken, and the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
Classes three and four then showed a chicken dance in the rehearsing of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young gobblings who wore cylinders for the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said headmaster Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (cows), but belongs to it.
But he'll never be like a chicken.
His destiny is to be free.
She wanted every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.
It was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former head of the school Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps into school shortages, and the parents' representatives.
The chick age is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She was reluctant to release her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth graders.
At the end, all the students sang a song of summertime and holiday time.
There was great joy among the children.
Eight first-graders are already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, reported.
On the morning of August 1st, police arrested a group of illegally camping people in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened up control over free camping and impose substantial fines on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What People Need to Know Now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust gas behaviour of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 cars.
Euro 4 diesels or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have cheat software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA).
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has indicated that it will contact everyone concerned.
If an inspection was due anyway, it would be done within their scope.
How long are the overall upgrades expected to last?
"Hard to say," says Smetaine.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers have not yet volunteered to act on the subject of the environment."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive cars from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises you to wait.
According to Smetanin, foreign producers would probably follow suit.
Is a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars now threatening?
The ACE fears that.
But it is precisely in the regions where driving bans are threatening.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesels.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come - in protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honoured.
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and take part in the award ceremony together with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear, who became known with progressive TV series, therefore already announced that he would not participate in the gala.
He said to the "New York Times": "This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and this is burdening me."
59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's mayor, will retire next year.
The post is already advertised, but suitable candidates are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And he still enjoys the work, as he communicates in the press conference.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application fulfils the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
Thus - while respecting the regular notice periods - there should be still enough time for an induction.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Building Law Authority for the administrative community, the applicant must have appropriate qualifications.
Because the city definitely wants to keep this function.
If they could no longer fill them out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports about a good working climate and a good mood between the authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have accumulated, and Wacker is proud to look back on them.
"We make the city worth living", he is sure of the construction office and its employees.
In the future, however, diverse projects will continue to be on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen car park, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
For a master builder, there is great scope for design.
With Haslach's own building yard and nursery, many things can be reacted quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing town architect emphasizes.
In any case, the master builder has a high responsibility.
He's a builder. "In the end, it's all over my table."
He can count on long-term employees for support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (Building) has been with us for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Low Building) has been with us for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to stay long: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify with the job and stay."
Because continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.
According to information provided by the city of Haslach, anyone wishing to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to complete a degree in architecture as a graduate engineer or bachelor and have good expertise in the fields of building regulations and planning law.
The municipal development office is responsible for building and civil engineering, construction planning, land acquisition matters, administration of the municipal properties, municipal depot with building yard and municipal gardening as well as Lower Building Law Authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: South railway line closed
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the railway overpass in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were damaged so much that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators assume two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Near the scene, witnesses had observed a pink scooter and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a lausbuben stroke," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA.
The perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also put train traffic at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system, as well as the minutes of delay and the costs for rail replacement traffic, the perpetrators could also be penalised by rail customers.
Overall, a "significant" sum could be assumed, said the speaker.
The damage was repaired again on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be carried without any obstacles.
Nearly ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday morning, two of which concerned long-distance transport.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While patients are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of causing inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result.
Experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell is found in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells".
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal milieus when the same system also works in humans.
The postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiomes of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequencing and six types of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3-lactic acid.
If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intestine.
Potentially high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genius", Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's £40 million signature began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last preseason game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward at will.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues' preparatory Asia tour and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" to fulfill three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've made great efforts."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew off from Seattle in Washington State, but the drawing began in Marquette in Michigan State and pulled in the form of a dreamliner across the USA, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was to be the form of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously done such advertising.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections.
Just no sturgeons from the party headquarters, just no headwind from the alliance - that was the most important wish of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching the events in the SPD-ruled state capitals with increasing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwind.
They were low blows.
One at a time.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot rule reliably," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising departure of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state elections, his red-green coalition lost its one-voice majority to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
The Green Federal Executive Michael Kellner has asked the apostate Lower Saxon Green MEP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate's will.
Elke Twesten has to return her mandate immediately," said the Federal Managing Director and campaign manager of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"This must not be true," sighs an SPD campaigner when the new Job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is without a government majority after the transition of the green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU.
It is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The misere began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, nothing more, calmed the comrades at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything would be different.
It then became so - and everything got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to a standstill, and the Düsseldorf-Pleite overturned the party.
The comrades struggled in the weeks after that.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And with him came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country chief, lost his nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because in crisis communication after that, he did pretty much everything wrong that you can do wrong.
Since then Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxon Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.
Miserable survey results were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil tried to set accents more and more in recent weeks.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were not hidden from comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz.
They let him be granted because they promised to stabilize the party from Weil.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Weil is basically not to blame for the party-internal bickering of the Lower Saxon Greens.
And certainly not Schulz.
In the meantime, therefore, the comrades strive to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here above all at the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and damaging to democracy how Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the list of the Lower Saxon Greens, the Lower Saxon MP continues.
The logical consequence would be for her to return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, laments an "undemocratic manoeuvre".
"The voter's will four years ago was clear: The people made Stephan Weil the prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the leading candidate in the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP distorts the election result," Oppermann continued.
He called for clarification of the background.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments by CDU Niedersachsen.
Grants for local centre III
If you want to renovate your old house, you can get support from the country soon.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler once again gave a review of what had happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - after all, it is important to promote interior development as well, and not only to open up new construction areas.
On 4 April, the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe had received the information that there would be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros came from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How does a redevelopment area arise?
According to Schindler, one will investigate where the "real old" houses are.
However, it also played a role to rehabilitate whether there was any interest in the planned area at all.
If necessary, the boundaries could then shift again.
STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-state program "Social City", in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object-related basis, i.e. per plot.
The restoration area would then be finally defined as a statute.
The grant period for the grants has been running from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
By September of this year, however, the inventory would be carried out, in the context of which the persons involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, the statutes are to be adopted as far as possible, so that the reorganisations can begin in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It was a matter of assessing the urban grievances and deciding when to renovate and to what extent.
For the respective land, a note of renovation will then be entered in the land register.
Pietzschmann himself will come to Empfingen again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land arch", which is about the structural condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing sheet", information on the size, distribution and inhabitants of a living space can be provided.
The blue "business form" must only be filled in if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not a request for funding at the same time.
Moreover, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies works according to the "first-hundled principle" - who comes first grinds first.
One could not "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the "Ortskern II" project were shown in order to make the participants a "tasteful" renovation.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand motion.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consulting anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The White House's advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military, which was left to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was at the heart of the July 17th event at the White House with American building programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of HMX-1 wrote to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at around 7 a.m. for the event at 3 p.m. and remained until the lawn was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 that evening.
The note adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of duty hours.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
It was not clear from the records made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate the determination.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.
"Sounds like you're locked," answered the deputy commander.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave impetus to the reform of the health reform underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But to request their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential aircraft performed taxi services against the backdrop of its first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and its Twitter account is full of news complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled with the show "Made In America" - which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers using American materials," said Lindsay Walters, deputy press secretary of the White House.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to provide the US President in the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on that day for "non-presidency support missions".
The White House said that taxpayers did not take the burden on any of the other props presented at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the US Department of Defense hourly rates for the 2017 financial year, the VH-3D's DoD refund rate is USD 24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs of operating the helicopter are far below this rate.
"Determining the cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimates of refund rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual budget."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At that time, former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire engine.
In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before tricky task
==References====External links==*FIFA profile*FIFA profile*FIFA profile
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will start tomorrow from 11 o'clock in Kiel at the table third Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five matches, the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga still has the sense of reality.
Team boss Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a similar formation.
Especially on the back positions I find the team very good."
For class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV mainly the imports from the far north ensure.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay with a view of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"As always, this will be difficult for us.
You also need a good portion of luck."
The Neusser team for the trip to the far north stands practically.
His debut for Blue-White could be Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman who is currently still active in the Challenger tournament in Biella, Italy, does not make it to the Bundesliga, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) who is playing at the tournament in the Czech Liberec will make his first appearance this season.
The Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo, who had not been defeated so far, was still at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski.
He was to be present in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could join the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one junior world ranking in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills up the squad.
How America Can Hurt OMV
Donald Trump did not seem really happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tighten up sanctions against Russia.
"In his haste to enact the law," Congress put a few "unconstitutional regulations," he etched.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed against the US move.
After all, the draft provides for penalising European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors of the local OMV, which together with other European companies co-finances the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2, have been concerned.
The threatening backdrop is enormous.
However, it is too early to assess the impact, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
He has twelve weapons to choose from.
"The press" has looked at which of the companies could fend off and which could really hurt him.
Narco's Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is put in the spotlight in Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's series is far from over.
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received its first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1st.
Roll backwards: The city hires 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the day care table itself.
With fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city's day care centers.
As of September 1, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the city's children's day facilities (Kitas) again in its own direction.
This is good news for Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the youth welfare department: "We were all very happy".
Cooked is still out of the house: a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly boiled chilled.
The city operates 46 day care centres in the Krefeld area, and in 44 children receive a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past year of kindergarten 2,800 children each sat at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"Meanwhile, not only children who are cared for for 45 hours a week eat lunch at the daycare center," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies to 35-hour care if children stay until 2:00 p.m."
From 1 September, 46 part-time workers will have kitchen service: they will warm up the food delivered, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give out the food, clean up, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a daycare center," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the amount of hours.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the daycare team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"In this way, they are much more involved and it is easier to implement educational concepts for the daycare centre."
Because that's also what it's about: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children should help to prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a known power in the daycare, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the daycare rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out in the future by special cleaning staff.
In addition to improving the quality of kitchen services, this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in comparison with the cost of its own management and outsourcing to the city, according to the Press Office.
And that is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited.
"But these hours are not so important for around 750 people in education," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will run in provincial council elections. Three women run for the role of Vice President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have issued threats against an electoral process that coincide with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will hand over power peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.

Men trying to rob 13-year-old girls
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to information from the police, the men approached the 13-year-old, who was with friends on Kolpingstraße, at about 2:55 p.m., because they wanted to use the girl's phone.
But the 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
As a result, one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's phone and necklace, but this failed.
Without booty, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.

GMB concern about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to make sure that managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie have a long-term commitment to production at their Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits alongside other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would "be the first to know" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's head of branch, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's "to express concerns that financing for the modernization of production lines would not be advanced."
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said, "The fact that we cannot get any clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly concentrated in the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie."
Pladis spokeswoman said: "Tollcross's branch manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, during which some questions were openly discussed.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the legacy of Tollcross as a production site. Should our operations change at the site, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Betrotti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in its persecution of Neymar after making an offer of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record-breaking attack?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer, as the Ligue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning last season to Manchester United for £89 million.
After completion, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the PSG president warning the football world about this prospect three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to have one of PSG's best players signed.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players signed with them, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Treutti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
On the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown offender deliberately knocked over a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus caused damage to the car's disguise of more than 200 euros.
The police Schramberg, telephone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for information.
The police are looking for witnesses for an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car approached him on his lane, the driver had to avoid a VW Touran and touched the guardrail.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum and his VW were on the B 215 from Stolzenau on the way to Leese.
In the area around Stolzenau, a car on his lane met him, so that he had to avoid to the right.
The Touran driver touched the guardrail.
Property damage was caused by the car.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it can be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident, as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle, to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves the burden of Pope George Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.
That's what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the abuse scandal at Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen continues to provide discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are the Church", said after publication to the German Press Agency that he expected an apology from the former Bishop of Regensburg and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or at that time their wrong assessment of the events.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticized the fact that the reporting of violence among the cathedral spats was measured with "two measures".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "despiteful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal," writes Scaraffia.
In an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said: "You like going to the church and that's a found food".
She also pointed out that in her youth "slaps were a normal educational tool" "to deal with naughty children, like I was one".
It would find it unfair to apply today’s standards to earlier decades, because the world had changed.
In connection with the reports of abuses, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely wrongly, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger wrote the memoir "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the Diocese of Regensburg to investigate the matter say?
A total of 547 Regensburg cathedral spats were sexually abused "with high plausibility" between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, 67 cathedral spats were sexually abused.
The final report says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be stated that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R..
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, it is noticeable that many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and, in many cases, even linked positive memories with him despite violence."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why he believes the final report on the abuse scandal with the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves it.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against protected persons at Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became palpable when a Domspatz musically did not bring top performance.
How do you view this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually occurs in it.
Only eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at preschool also occurred outside his sphere of action.
At best, he can be accused of not having learned too late or of not taking the first suggestions seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by practically all respondents as - so literally - "salvation", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also give a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warm", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "comprehensive", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always surrounded by grapes from children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has also led to fury.
The fact that he not only banged with chairs and threw the keyring on the ground, but also slapped hands and pulled too cheeky boys by the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
To save his honour, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, both among parents and teachers.
Do you also know such punishing methods?
Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.
I also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in preschool, these are, of course, trivial.
One wonders if it is not more to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just rushed at him.
Many who have never understood him are still working hard on the Bavarian pope.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, a great deal was reported in connection with the report on the subject of abuse at Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also charged with any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
Not a single of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were informed.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one affected person on behalf of the others, "it was all very embarrassing for me."
The real problem in the investigation of sexual abuse was and still is that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a way.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger's role in relation to abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A student in question put it this way: "As regards sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he of all people (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think ... it is also really absurd to assume that ... boys of all people have opened up to him more forcefully or more clearly or rather than to their parents, boarding schools heads, counselors, etc.
That you're talking to him about sex... unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that the pupils and/or their environment concerned entrusted themselves to him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the study".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is to be acquitted of any co-scientism.
Nor can he be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to justice.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was a lot of "violence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Looking Away".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem that everything was mixed up and mixed up in the coverage into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excesses of violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is exactly what the report is about to be misused.
In fact, there is a clear separation: between the preschool and the grammar school of the cathedral spats, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence, and, let's say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the cathedral spats.
All the terrible beating pedagogy, the cases in which boys were literally harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly from it, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got to see the boys when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.
On it, as the vast majority of witnesses stress, the subject of "preschool" was taboo.
They were just happy to have escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite the violence, they even associate positive memories with him".
So at the most remains the reproach of having looked away.
Despite all efforts, however, the report was able to define only two periods during which it was reported about preschool conditions.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and wanted to hear nothing about the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (as the witness said), and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out that "preschool continues to practice beating punishment".
Already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when beatings were long since forbidden in Bavaria.
Before that, they happened in a legal grey area, as we all probably remember.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected might have exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he's always looked the other way.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that the beating penalty at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "fall trick of anachronism", i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right about that.
But this does not apply, of course, to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable and also not to what was committed in preschool of adversities and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was usual at the time.
It's all awful and I'm glad it's finally being reworked.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. slapping his ear and his hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg time was given by Georg Ratzinger in his conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Did the subject of beating also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, the cathedral spats played only a secondary role.
Nevertheless, I do not hide the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But this also has to be said: Without this perfectionism, without demanding absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution out of Regensburg Cathedral spats, which had previously been more nationally known, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and sweets alone, you don't turn unruly boys into great singers and stand before every success, regardless of the field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the discussions about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again I experienced him as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and heart-warming people, of whom one cannot imagine that he could do anything to harm even a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former cathedral spats still today, 23 years after his retirement, keep in regular contact with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once strict with them are therefore clearly in the minority.
Most of the cathedral spats today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that might be - but he was also a lovable person of respect, to whom they still look up today and which they almost worship.
And please, once again, quite clearly, all he is accused of is educational methods that were common at the time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is highly unfair to make a man a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intention behind this is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves it.
Now the decency would command, a 93-year-old man who has earned great merit and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps still Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, to finally leave in peace.
