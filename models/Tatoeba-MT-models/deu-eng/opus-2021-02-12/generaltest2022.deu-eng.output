The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am #PRS_ORG# major and so it is not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should add to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel and reorder the order for the better price or is there another option of credit?
In principle, I also think that children should not be expected to play a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Look for a moment, help for a moment, bring the bottle etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be themselves enough child, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for a short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
It's best for you to see if that's right for your kids.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and accompany K2 for hours of sleep.
Legally, it's probably questionable.
Maybe that's where the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something really happened like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course your discretion ;)
Please help me to find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a thriller a few years ago and although I can still remember almost the whole storyline, I don't want to think of the title partout anymore maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caretaker commits suicide by spilling himself with food and going into the enclosure to his predators.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, gets to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats fear patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is assigned anonymously before every suicide to go to the place of the self-murder and document and place the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and the patients finally face their fear in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window another drives herself to death on purpose)
This face fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
In the end, there's a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That's the rough story I'm quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author.
If this plot is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, jeez, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
I need to get in touch with my husband first.
This can take a while.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference remitted ?
Child, 4 j., splinter under the thumb nail
Child, four years old, has over the entire length of wood splinters under the thumb nail (outside).
Trying to pull it off with a tweezer.
Very hard to grasp.
Didn't work out and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Through the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a PCB, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotives of the track gauges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multi-protocol decoder.
It can handle the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders register fully automatically at a suitable digital centre.
It controls all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values on the main track can be read with suitable control panels.
For centers that can program only the CVs from 1-255 there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed steps at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration at mfx®-compatible control panels.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® brake sections as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake blocks or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops at a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC automatic commuter train allows automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC circuits.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to promote booster vaccination
Always new Omikron cases provide politics and science in the UK.
By the New Year all qualifying adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress with Corona booster vaccinations in view of rapidly increasing Omikron numbers than previously intended.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson told his compatriots on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK government would also provide support to speed up vaccination campaigns in the areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, people are faced with an emergency, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, Johnson said.
The good news was that the level of protection could be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
"Let's get a boost now!" Johnson said.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price at collection?
I'm in favour of everyone introducing themselves to pronouns.
I sent out an application.
Today came the invitation to a conversation by mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
But unfortunately the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I Googled him and depending on where he/she got a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can someone please help me?
** I am a foreigner and I don't want to kick an official over my feet.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine with pronouns.
Got a total of five books on it.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work
Obviously, the chair had an unobservable lack at sale.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Only tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
==References====External links==
14 days no more.
Therefore, I always bought the last books from the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge me this.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I'm going to write a little bit in detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about my soul.
I (21) come more frequently into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
One topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims do not let themselves be helped or think we could not help them.
I realize that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation in private, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of tearing the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is partly very close to tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But this never makes it any easier.
Please, always remember, you're worth living without violence, that's so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series fit for "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two season?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP giant Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was reliable.
Again nothing: For the second time in less than three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the match, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said: "We still have some anger in our stomach" with the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in early October.
After the match, however, it did not settle - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
Even more so than the naked result disappointed the way of the performance.
The statistics are representative of the whole dilemma: the three-way ratio was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) in no less than 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer was given by John Patrick: "After the victory at Tenerife, we were simply not concentrated enough, and did not implement what we trained."
That's moving the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "To win a great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the lucky coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people before."
Only 750 visitors were allowed on Saturday in the Hohenlohe-Arena, but they came at their expense.
Not least because of BBL-Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and managed the game of his team.
"The best gamemaker I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team even the top players such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and got up to eight points after they had already been 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there isn't much time to fight.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
we used to have another mail address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I got back to you a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We were legally informed again and wrote to them again about it.
We originally called six months ago.
Always peeled out of the egg: Max Raabe gets 59
He can inspire his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Good day, good luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it won't happen.
The planned concert was moved to May 2022 - "on official instructions" to contain the Corona virus.
Other of his planned performances during the Advent season must also fail, as it is called on the website of the singer, who is now 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to make up for their deadlines, which had already been published in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot and enjoyed singing as a teenager.
In Berlin he studied operatic singing, in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place on the charts - just like his successful album "For Women is not a problem" (2013).
He made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly combed back and cared for etiquette, Max Raabe from the current German-speaking music landscape is indispensable.
With the program "Good day, good luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small piece of furniture in advance?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and so we could check beforehand whether it fits color
It still doesn't work I can only crave the cover sheet but can't scroll.
Federal Construction Minister Klara Geywitz: Dispossession does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Construction Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation, no new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants certainty that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
A colourful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz did not rule out discussions with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening up of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in strained housing markets and the expansion of the rental mirror.
I'm going to talk to the Minister of Justice to get this done as quickly as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipment take?
I've already cut my finger
This is an absolute insolence
At least 100 deaths from tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have moved through the US.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 people could be killed.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
During the night on Saturday, several tornadoes in the United States have caused severe devastation and may have killed up to a hundred people.
The storms leave behind an approximately 320-kilometer-long snipe of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
His governor Andy Beshear said, after a visit to the disaster area, that wherever the tornado ran through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, with official figures rising hourly.
Hi, I just saw that she's sold out showcase #NAME#.
That's too bad.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely taken out of the range?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
When will you be in touch?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order !
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an artike or gave a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if this was received or processed, as I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay immunization premiums and change advertising slogans
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and offer their employees money bonuses for vaccination.
They are therefore on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into immunization calls - according to the German model - is also intended to increase the readiness for Corona vaccinations.
He switched to a company he blasphemed about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and have some tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously did not sew himself in his old place and was looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant.
I'm making a screen shot.

Help with first own campaign
Boron to the shock!
For a group of 4 friends, I am running the Adventure Over the Griffin Pass and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual files are made up and now I am writing the entry-level adventure and stumble on my own feet already at the first encounter.
The premiere is that the heroes should bring a cart of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There the further action is to develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of Goblins are supposed to ambush the hero and lure him into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: convince, act, threaten, recognize the danger at an early stage, whatever comes to mind for the players.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabres
In case of noticing, the Goblins lurk the hero in a hollow way and flank to each three left and right arches armed with the cartage, while two with spears stop the cartage.
If it comes to battle and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village school, a half-elf.
The cart's gone, of course.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the help of the hero in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much to start the adventure?
The Goblins group will play a decisive role later, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will certainly take many of your ideas into account and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I broke up the lamp again.
And stuck together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd still like to send her back
If you can then let the return tickets come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#.

Is everything then picked up again or just the storage part?
I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to breathe a little bit with this post.
First of all, today in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was cancelled in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although due to the delayed start and the start accident the schedule was far behind the schedule, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, it is the case that for legal reasons the F1 takes precedence and therefore has to restrict everything else, so that Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has finished the race.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then in the F1 there was again a lack of knowledge of the rules with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that the tires could be changed when there were corresponding radio messages on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for verstappen.
I think you should simply know such elementary rules when commenting on the F1 on a pay-TV channel.
Nor is it the first puzzle guess, which is now possible or prescribed by the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
Generally speaking, Roos does not like the artificial comment style, but admits that the taste is a matter of fact.
But I really like even Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant absurdities, both of which simply make it seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (also unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the ads are simply outnumbered by Sky, in the final round Sky is the only channel that goes into the commercials, as you can listen to on F1TV because only the German audio track has to get along without comment directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do.
Also, these two channels do less advertising in the training than Sky, and this as a free TV channel.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repetitions.
All in all, Sky is really the worst German-language channel to broadcast the F1.
Unironically, RTL is doing a better job in the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, with the exception of advertising.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
On this: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multicoloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The First Lady told me that it would be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them already showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
See the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the benefits in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can use them to operate entire plants.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable, so that you can connect several outflows.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump can also be used to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find it in our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or something like that.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated design and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an austromer or similar...and it is ready to go.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and should be installed on the outside.
If the fan pump sits deeper like the water level, you should put a check valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent once water would run backwards that the water from the pool would run through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time with 3 days here in ebay, the packages are packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
Things are going well on the way, it's going very fast.
We just want to prevent a little, so that no one is displeased just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the forwarding industry...of course here no Corona stops.
Please don't judge equally badly, just because the delivery is delayed, that's entirely due to the parcel services.
You like to scold at these services, of course, even if we say right now... they're having a hell of a hard time
This is also very different from one region to another.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Can you order your legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have made a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the New Shepard rocket system of Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the state of Texas.
Under bright blue skies, Bezos himself received the newly selected astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit when he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named after the Blue Origin rocket system, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not tell them how much they paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard on his assignments and do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would like to return to space immediately, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometres altitude
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of about 100 kilometres above the earth, sometimes with zero gravity, before the reusable object landed again, slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the earth as a border to outer space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already Blue Origin's third manned all-out: the first time in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.

Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing forward the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting in itself and also standing in the laboratory does not bother me (have already the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I was already informed about career prospects before my studies, but I also thought at the time that I would like to and will definitely study until my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially with regard to my career prospects.
On the one hand (study check etc) one hears again and again great job opportunities and the job is totally wanted, on the other hand one hears again and again from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I'd really like to know:
1) What are you working as right now?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/what training did you do?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really insecure right now and maybe I'm thinking about dropping out of my studies in 2022 and getting an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have experience there, she likes to write times :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's only a post now.
Not only before a big holiday, like the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
It seems there's the one before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses are making a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So there was a long 4-day weekend in the house last week.
So what went on last week?
Stress everywhere.
A lot of e-mails that absolutely had to get out before the driveway, order here order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that can't be?
Or because people really want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed out on Wednesday, but I was also really annoyed.
What's this self-hosting about holidays?
Then why do we still have holidays if we are not allowed to treat them properly?!
The stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all on their own.
My question is simple: are we just like this, the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-evangelical nature?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no presents yet.
"The beautiful, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will prepare herself for the feast by baking and making cookies with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
But she still has a lot to do until the contemplative days: "For the first time I don't have any presents yet, I finally have to get started".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth flow of the Mauser and the plumage formation.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of plumage damage occurring in bird husbandry is due solely to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Much of the animal losses occurring during the mollusc process are due to a lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No additional vitamin supplement should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Still not working
East German manual work model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968, used with playing tracks and defective parts see photos, function good, the series E 95 is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn Society (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal whole trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are working
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to carry 2,200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at 45 km/h cruising speed on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG designated the Siemens Schuckertwerke with the electrical part by supplying the mechanical part as 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the E 95 01–06 operating numbers.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as reparation goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahn repair plant Dessau the reworking of all six locomotives was established.
[4] As the central German network was electrified, there was an increasing demand for locomotives for the heavy goods train service.In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were reworked, with the other machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger quantities, were preferred.
Only when it was foreseeable that the reprocessing number could not be further increased in the E 94 could the E 95 move into the focus of the reprocessing.
[4]The locomotives were initially stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They came to the Halle P.
They were mostly used in their own circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic.
So it often happened that shooters stayed stuck during switching operations.
Then the Beimann with hammer and wooden wedge had to release the shooter while driving on this locomotive.
Damages to the driving engines occurred more often and resulted in months of failure of the locomotive.
[5] Since at the end of the 1960s there were enough new locomotives available and a significant expansion of the electrical operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn could dispense with old locomotives and most of the splitter types, so that the E 95 were put out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only one-man, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility of the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were discontinued in mid-1969, they were the last to be followed by the E 95 01, which quits service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system at the main station in Halle.
It took some time until those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive began to be reworked, with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive is maintained as a museum.
Since 1995 employees of the traditional association Bw Halle P have been working on the operational reprocessing of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paintwork, with the transformers being checked and five traction motors operating.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian mountain railway and the branching off branch lines, where they proved themselves because of their reliable drive and the low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were converted to a central German network in Leipzig.
The main application area was initially Silesia
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, function well, optical rework on the locomotive is necessary in own work, dusted, with playing tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare manual model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and traces of storage.
Yes, the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet.Unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, these are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The center bar does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent out?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones from the shape, they were only too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfil their purpose
With me, they're not flat
Could I have these sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Home fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, estimated damage has occurred in the six-digit euro area, as reported by the police on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reported to have been hospitalized on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume a deliberate firing.
The police of Fürstenfeldbruck have taken over the further investigation.
But then she arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To defuse fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021
Biontech boss Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend had caused him to do so, said Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he receives vaccination against the coronavirus.
On social media, there was false information that I had allegedly not been vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post in the network "LinkedIn" on Friday.
"For several months now, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me on which I am vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he had refused, because communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a serious Covid 19 disease and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fuelled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with Deutsche Welle, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated, circulates.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle himself clarified.
"I am currently not legally allowed to receive the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time.
There was a prioritisation in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech boss has been vaccinated three times according to the appropriate data.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had shut down a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to live without electricity for about 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities.
The provider Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power units had been in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely repaired in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers of THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, Head of Primary Technology, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage would take a few days, since the West Netz-Monteure could initially only temporarily restart some lines, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out at 7.15 p.m. on Friday in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear.
There, elaborate cleaning and repair work were necessary.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level had been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday 6 pm more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth would have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9.30 p.m.
Since 23.15 o'clock also the last affected by the failure would have electricity.
More than 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were in operation.
After setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is now important that the citizens in their neighbourhood take care of elderly or single people and report to the local fire department buildings when help is needed," said District Councillor Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The main focus of the installation and operation of emergency power units was on the residents of old people's homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places in schools were set up for those people who were unable to take care of themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or who are dependent on medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay them in euros?
It is the day blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy
But I can't mount the underframe on the table top.
It is custom #NAME#.
There are three of them.
We wanted those with tabletops diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push it into each other and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send them back, otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy to receive a feedback
yes, that's really easier!
Let's do it this way!
Will you send me the return slip by e-mail?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Do you want me to do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic combination: combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combinedists Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
Once again, the duo had to give in to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started in the cross-country ski track with a big head start after ski jumping.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both made new s and use version 4.5...
could be that they have heard of problems before
I bought directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book it also seems to be on it.
Sobal I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be trouble reporting to customer service.
As far as I can see it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between!
To make the paint application even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water of dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you put the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later no longer visible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly line next to line.
A slight overlap of the paint layers ensures a uniform surface later.
Avoid quick back and forth wiping with the brush.
This creates unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could go through later.
Metal tones and metallic colours come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise it can come to unsightly metal streaks if they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you disperse them.
The models achieve true-to-original appearance through the decals or decals.
From national emblems on airplanes to ship names to trims and license plates for car models: the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Attach the decals in the right order as long as the components are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or more easily before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a calm hand when glued on.
Cut out each decal you need and arrange it for you.
Decals are also called water slide images, because you moisten their back briefly with water until the carrier paper gets dark through the wet.
Then you push the picture only a small piece of paper and place the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you have moistened before).
While holding the Decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper off sideways.
Attention: Always check if the picture is right before you push it completely off the paper so that it doesn't stick to the finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Swallow excess water with a household towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else then I no longer read the book and have to unsubscribe and register and reload the book and look for the place until where I have read.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
Okay, thanks anyway!
I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money's back.
Can I get that back without a problem?
Child care at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello, everybody.
we were in child care for some time, now when it comes to the reckoning with the PKV, this suddenly goes wrong.
In order:
We had applied for the children's wish train in advance at the PKV and got the promise over 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was billed with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and did 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet calculate them with the PKV.
We again applied for the cost transfer at the PKV and were granted another 3 further attempts.
After a few more tests (we have carried out more tests than promised, logically the most expensive ones count with the PKV) we submitted the invoices at the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 tests (2+3) the PKV wants to refund only 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second wish for children is a new insurance case.
According to the General Terms and Conditions, however, "the insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out in the pledges that with a birth the further attempts would be lost?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give your opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to get them back best
All right.
We won't order anything from them anymore.
When they add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost good customer.
They are welcome to pass this on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague said to me that the repayment was arranged and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back.
I can't help it that the dresser arrives at me completely disturbed
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear that the repayment was initiated and I have still not received any repayment via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not gonna do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, I'm not able to get another kind of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget movies
What a low budget movie is exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What's wrong with it?
And what don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already 2 apartments completely furnished with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this also reliable now?
Thank you very much.
Sincerely,
There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll give up again soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
"Half victory" against Belarus associated with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in conflict with the Belarusian regime.
But the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU had not resolved the confrontation sustainably, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) explained.
This floating state - Belarus does not give in very small, but the EU feels it is the winner - is likely to go on for a while.
Dealing with the people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
There appears to be an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It obviously cannot prevail if a Member State heads up to do its thing", as Poland is currently doing, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex to access the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, says Bossong: A principle agreement on asylum policy is being made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Re-attempt to cross borders
Meanwhile, according to Poland's border guards, migrants have again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested at night on Sunday and returned to the border, said a spokesman for the agency on Sunday.
In the incident near the village of Czeremsza, the Polish officials were stoned by the migrants.
According to the report, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically looked after by a military doctor.
A total of 52 border guards registered attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as the ruler in Minsk of having lured them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania closed off border sections according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to people's countries of origin to prevent their departures.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has put its market power in the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with harsh bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk also had to take internal political costs into account.
The Belarusian society was probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly smuggle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is said to have made two changes to the rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After Abu Dhabi's controversial Formula 1 finale, Mercedes has appealed.
The Silver Arrows assume two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken him illegally.
A second objection was filed against the evaluation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had passed Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had raced to his first Formula One title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars driving before him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you.
thanks for the support
Free entry for members: Europa-Park organizes SC-Freiburg-Fantag
The Europa-Park, the name given to the Europa-Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited Fantag to the SC Freiburg.
As the park informs, members and season ticket holders of the Sport Club from the Breisgau and members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains lit red and white through the jerseys that day.
Foxes, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," says the park.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the cooperation between the Bundesliga and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it was again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans who have fun together in the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# night table and a return label.
That e-mail hasn't come in yet.
The package wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
Sincerely,
The LokSound 5 decoder can play up to 10 channels simultaneously.
Each channel can be resolved with up to 16 bits / 31250 kHz and finally offers HiFi quality on your system.
There is virtually no difference to the original audible.
A Class-D audio amplifier with up to 3W output power controls the speakers, which can have between 4 ohms and 32 ohms impedance.
The huge 128 Mbit sound memory ensures enough capacity.
All individual noises can be individually adjusted in volume.
The super-flexible sound engine without a rigid schedule allows the model simulation of all conceivable rail vehicles.
Three separately adjustable braking functions and two alternative load scenarios give you maximum control over your vehicles.
Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite means nothing.
It's like an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Both of them won't admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it complete.
Yeah, wow, then you're just as little serious as Kollegah.
Those who seriously question evolution in principle are simply completely lost.
Because of me, a god set the whole thing in motion.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just a waste of nonsense.
And with that you are an enemy of science and not to take any more seriously like Kollegah
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass in a practical way without any colour defects up to the edge zone.
Magnifiers are often marked with magnifications.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to use your magnifying glass optimally, we ask you to follow the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections are generated on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - i.e. also with impact magnifiers.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
If the optimum conditions of use - magnifying glass close to the eye - are observed, reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the accompanying instructions for use (available in German and English).

#PRS_ORG# I will do very nice and good service, although it took until you got to a person, they were great
Hello dear #PRS_ORG# team,
I have already registered with you under the customer contact with the number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yeah, but it was before.
They can't deliver from England because of #PRS_ORG#.
Selling firs in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some strange situation in the sale of firs.
Once a man was said to have gone home without his partner, because both couldn't agree.
Every year he plants a good 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some curious situation.
That always makes the pre-Christmas season a little fun, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I am gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to have discussions here about the better court, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both therefore have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "turner", which doesn't sound so tasty by far.
Problems with optical fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber connection in the house for a couple of weeks.
Unfortunately, I have problems now to build a stable Wifi network.
Before that I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent out 50 Mbits without a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbits to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also arrives.
However, on the other DLan module, which sends out the Wifi, the full 500 no longer arrive, but the further away I am in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. using a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (-45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similarly large losses.
Could anyone explain to me why optical fiber "lost" so much Internet speed over the power line?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely expensive to install LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased to receive an answer.
When it is time to change the current account
Who would have thought that now would be quiet with the current accounts, sees itself wrong.
While many banks have used the autumn to get all kinds of tricks from their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past, the allowances for negative interest rates are also falling further.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous for a long time with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she halved the allowance and even quartered it for the day's money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group division Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for day-to-day money accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as at ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all: According to figures from the Verivox website, more than 100 banks now have a fee of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which in the first instance even got justice against this regulation before the Landgericht Berlin.
Now the banks are already discussing whether institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that even the upper authorities declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions of bank customers have to be paid back.
The table top was delivered for 8 people instead of those for 6 people.
The base is that for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She's officially at the top of Hollywood now.
But their lives are like a descent and descent.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the U.S. magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who caused a stir in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and coaches take care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she treats herself to a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a unique chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of the female and male fans still fly towards her equally is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just unlucky with the luck - and she's still looking for the big love.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's wrong with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let us hope that success and fame will also make us happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 went even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped his sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight gang contact, Räikkönen had to turn off his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finished his career in the motorsport king class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the World Championship in the Ferrari in 2007.
He made 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in doubles - Sport
The mark of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I did this once, I would have to win nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First on Saturday, he resisted the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, driving from third to one.
Then he changed the material setting and drove out a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he prevailed in front of the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier became third.
"We took greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22nd victory in series production.
Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came to second place this time in fifth place.
Christoph Ofer from the BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after fourth place in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do the same," Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte took the third win of the season in the doubles at her home race.
After only fourth place in the Monobob the previous day, she raced to the World Cup victory on Sunday in the German three-time success with forward Deborah Levi.
Two-time Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded the first podium place this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me with her.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and stressed: "It's not just pushing, but there's also a lot to do about it."
Jamanka annoyed a little about the not quite error-free rides, but said: "It goes in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I just did not receive it and therefore could not redeem why I finally asked for it.
Corona gave me a lot of other problems last year and I never had time for it.
And now it's said it's expired, which upsets me very much.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare seat.
I want to return it and then order it again, as it is currently reduced :)
Why is shipping not started until 16.3.
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No only when I tap an extra field comes with the message
Was taken by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the misdelivered would.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a lot of things I just want to write and maybe one or the other goes like this...
I'm 24, I have KPTBS, full-time student and dog mama - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (together since 6J) is ill, has a second degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him shower (because hand is in the bandage wg burn).
It's also cooled and we're seeing each other less (1-2 times a week) which makes me very uncomfortable with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child has a stomachache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was with the heat lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we are going to do housework, which of course we are dividing up.
But cooking yourself is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD disease is just quite well-adjusted, I am halfway well-treated and manage.
Not good, but I'm getting along and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is asking a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have not yet done anything and the day after tomorrow anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week, I'll have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no more room.
So my week goes like this: only until the day after tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But after that the whole thing goes on?
Just until your birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holiday.
Only until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I'm packing that ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't do it...
Is that how you feel?
Honestly, I'm so grateful I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't put that into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think it has a lot to do with mental load of women, and that's why I thought I'd probably find fellow sufferers here...
I certainly wish you a restful evening, the week is almost done!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, I'll get another color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
By the way, two times.
But she wasn't confirmed.
Something completely different: I found out at school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me, it was always a bit strange, perhaps because I was raised as a Christian and I always believed in it somehow.
How do you feel about that?
Perhaps you can also tell about work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There's a syllabus, too.
But would it just be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity?
What makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Is it a culture or something?
Hope you're asking is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Please write in English I understand that well
It's been a long time, then I'd stop
All right, thank you.
I expect a prompt response by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie search Help please
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (born 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, modernism (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in more detail in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live for himself I mean.
The crossing is also the grave of the soldier.
In the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If that tells you anything, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little girl slept only on her belly from week one.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A kid like that can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything is right, no cuddly toys, go in more often and watch, but no minutes of surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Ahso and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your kid when he's asleep.
Is it turning its head to the side?
Can it straighten up from the belly?
Or is it in front of the face right in the mattress?
That's where you can tell if everything's okay.
We all grew up, too, and when my husband was born, it was zb gang and would give you to put the kids on your stomach to sleep.
In addition, we are already "Stammkunde" with you and have already bought many items
But then why do you offer me only 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the closet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not to be used.
Well, let's be clear.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV, too.
But it's just that the politics of this station are now under all sows.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that you were an "independent" internet station.
Quote Arno: One wants "not to be a running column".
What are you now?
An 0815 advertising channel trying to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they're allowed to continue insulting people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How do you think it's all good?
Great if you like it, I think it's awful.
I ask for a call back, because my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Corpus breach due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter in case of stomach ache or just for cuddling – my little warm friend can be used in many ways.
Cherry kernel cushions are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry kernels can absorb heat very well and release it dosed again.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry-core cushion with reference is suitable as a heat coating only for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for atypical smells, stick or burn spots and discard immediately if present.
Please take the inner cushion out of the cover to warm up beforehand!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (please note the microwave manufacturer's information!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion in the cover.
The first heats may cause a slight moisture formation on the surface, but it disappears during repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the heating instructions given, as longer periods or higher energy performances can lead to damage (threats of ignition and combustion!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been put back in the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) at your arm bend!
Do not use the pillow in case of acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory problems, fresh haematoma, bruising and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced feeling of pain.
For existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumours and pregnancy, contact a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores are released, discard the product and loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be checked regularly during use to rule out overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country where the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working from the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt, it doesn't work under the third coach.

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so I should still work.
I thought power supply alone was enough to operate.
Failed, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite plugged in power supply.
As a result, I removed the battery, but there is nothing going on here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in power mode?
Is there anything else that's broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is....
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design!
20 litres of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stowed with the help of the padded FlexFold parts.
And what else you need in everyday objects remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: Once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in the Messenger Bags.
In the shutter there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered various "filling levels": there are 4 anchor bars, stable riveted, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
In addition, flap closure and hooks are magnetic.
This way, the backpack can also be reliably closed without locking the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to dig through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday suitability of the backpack enormously: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday objects or luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and store both separately without any problems - and access it independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack in front of the body from the right side, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday things stay safe in the left half of the backpack and don't interfere.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable straps help with this.
And since the outer cover of the backpack is also made entirely from 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will remain dry even if they are to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I wait in vain for the emails from their support.
#NAME# sent me yesterday an email from confirmation for the assignment of
Contact announced by the forwarding company to pick up the wrongly delivered table.
So far, I haven't received a message.
I'm asking for immediate settlement.
I'm already writing with the third support employee, with none of them I went further than the promise that I'll receive an email as confirmation.
This is the return of the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
Is it foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like that is not an option for me...
It's working.
Thank you very much for your help
Have a nice evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the coupon, I will place a larger order right away, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And that the past year went differently than I thought I could not guess and just could not redeem and clarify it in time.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept it.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety even in difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific for certain discs and samples.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which depends on the characteristics of the original assembly with the balancing of the disc.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
In addition, created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, whereby the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake blocks.
Aesthetic properties of our tuned discs underline the character of each car by their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing boulders in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread rapidly and triggered the so-called California Gold Rush from '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were staked, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many it was said: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You're going to look for gold, recruit workers, gather horses and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You need to outdo your pioneer colleagues so you don't go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously select your actions, need to budget your resources and build a tableau that will "work" more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions, or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays for a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), from 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the right locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables one half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
The players then perform alternate actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning revolvers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the promoter turns to a new location and thus changes the available actions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, i.e. has covered every location once and the year ends.
There's a shooting in which players have to defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score.
The player with the most winning points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation showed up in my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he triggered a fierce educational debate.
Former patient: now, the parents are making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourself, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and others in charge must never, never, never! for power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is reasonable and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries discuss the elimination of testing requirements for triple immunities
The health ministers of the Länder want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide elimination of the test obligation for triple immunities.
"We countries quickly need clarity as to whether and from when the test obligation can be eliminated for three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, the "Picture on Sunday".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinations is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) had promised "that he would make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on this matter next Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back
What's the best way to do this?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't do any more shopping through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Ups, an error occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I've updated my account data.
What can be the reason for this?
What you describe is called *awareness*, meaning sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 to 1000.
It is most common to hear noises/voices, less often to see images and, most rarely, to perceive pain.
Relevant for this topic: C-sections are operations that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided for the protection of the child until it is taken away.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during anaesthesia preparation.
Certain anaesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine describes Awareness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
I misread her comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ does not help us.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We'll sell the second chair privately.
We're losing a lot of money.
I already sent you an e-mail that you did not answer.
Again, the question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know any person who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Don't you think I'm being called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died 97 years old
He has become a theatre critic and an artistic director.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is the new book on the table, fresh from the press: "An old man is getting older".
The shocking diarium of a slow departure from the world, led by theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I already testify here my thanks for life".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are europallets, standardised wooden pallets, which are used primarily in the European area as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association (EPAL)
According to statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported annually to Austria is not collected
New York wins first MLS Championship
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
The Eastern Conference team won the final with a score of 4:2 in the first round of the regular season against Portland Timbers.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York won against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
That was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I have come to the taste and would like to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow, I'm going to set up a cattle fund for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, but only a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I can handle it.
IES is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by e-mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But to this day the money has not been received by me.
I'd like you to check that out.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people goose or duck belongs to the Christmas days like the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
Time's running out.
We'll tell you where you can get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME control, you can set the desired level on the one hand and the distortion content of your sounds on the other.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller, with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything about the "gain" and the distortion.
Further up it already sounded that with the POWER LEVEL controller you can even make a power reserve fast, when things get loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controllers, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be exploited in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal attached here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphones or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you additionally buy a VFS5 foot button, you can also easily call the sounds by foot, turn the effect blocks on/off and "tapping" the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new powerhouses, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I had seen it that way with others.
Is it then possible to send the lamp back to you?
Since it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If I can't, I'd be happy with a discount or coupon.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods I don't need are then something much.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not paid off
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
According to Iranian figures, progress has been made in the negotiations on reviving the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the Irna News Agency.
This was a "positive and important development" because at the beginning there had not even been agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement aims to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the revitalization of the agreement were continued after just one week of interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia participate in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only federal state to be located at the Corona-Inzidenz on Sunday above the mark of 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always shown the highest incidence in Germany, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 severely ill with Covid-19 were treated intensively on Sunday in hospitals.
There may be late reporting on weekends.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and are hardly able to follow up with the registration of new cases.
I understand.
Since delivery is not until the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print this out and stick it to the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
here I don't have to click/specify/fill anything else?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is an insolence in my eyes.
It's time for change
###MBundestag Greetings, I am u/StratorDE in the Chamber in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
# What's the mail here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, you can see one thing: it is not extant.
We have come into a winter stare and have extended the summer hole to a few months.
#What's the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to dissatisfaction, as some things have happened here and as we generally stand.
In the last few days the impression has become more and more apparent, that many here really still want to the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a pile of shards.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to urge everyone once again to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange views and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How should the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we perform outwardly in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a few things, but that's not bad, so we end up with the Discord.
If you want and have time, come to the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/cracky for that and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you for this.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope that this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day blanket #PRS_ORG#, is it also in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to make that happen now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but I will remove the cabinet as far as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to arrange a collection date.
Is there any instructions for assembly?
How long would I have time to get them or to decide to return them?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, probably also very rarely eats meat at the moment.
I myself was a vegetarian for a few years before.
When asked whether I always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thinking.
I thought for a long time that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but at some point I reflected and understood that I ultimately also support animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that on her side displeasure arose, she then defended vegetarianism and meant that she knew where her flesh came from and was reduced as a vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was to 'pump'?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without putting it on it.
It greets a vegan who loves harmony (;
It is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Do not release your #PRS_ORG# from the legal requirements for distance sales.
I am at the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# does not pick up my returns on site.
Since I can't be there because of a funeral, I can't change that either.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date, please.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I am always back.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz handed over a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle from the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment truck is used by the diving squadron Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there are long-term expectations of increasing deployments: the boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the continued increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought a book which I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, however, have synchronized, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has taken me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, so be it.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection in June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

First of all, thank you for standing up to the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar activity, i.e. we were also arms carriers in the executive, I don't want to go further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that, of course, the servant of the state comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
It should also be clear to everyone that, of course, even in a special uniform and arms bearer, people on the right of conservative magically attract people to the right should be able to understand that these people are hard to deal with living reality, of course, because you have, of course, in addition to the average white, now many Germans with a migrant background, women and also homosexuals (and by this I don't mean the over-female cliché gay, because in the executive there are rather less to not at all but normal men and women who you don't notice if they don't tell you) and also these people I can and must rely on, because in case of doubt they save your life or use it for you.
But these marginal groups also represent a conservative attitude, even if it sounds strange in my experience, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel rather less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly stands up for them or thinks they have to make it right, in doing so they just want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the right, because of course police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme rights there, but that they can openly say their opinion there or even openly forge any plans that endanger the state is completely exaggerated and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that even policemen and soldiers who were often in foreign assignments often begin to flatten due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-minded fellows meet for sure, who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, this is fought well and is also countered by political education and education.
Germany is so involved internationally and that's also good in my opinion that we couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, which I do not understand, I ordered the other basket also on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available anywhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep notches, which were filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More orderly through child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am self-employed, very little free time), but already my life I get it more badly than right to run my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it grabs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it is never "that someone could come to visit spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) not better either, although it bothers me somewhere but mostly household simply loses against work and lack of pleasure.
The kitchen is cleaned the most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, did you manage to get better with your child?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it, and that's a question that's been on my mind for a while.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visit comes and e.g. always fresh clothes are there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unrestricted freedom of movement.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-confident personality disorder?
I have been training in software development and have been studying for about a year now.
Unfortunately, however, I notice more and more that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time about starting again and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoiding) personality disorder (EVPS).
This means, roughly speaking, that I have no self-esteem and are therefore shy.
I don't have a problem talking to people on a factual level, but it's very difficult for me to have loose conversations and I've been told several times that I seem unapproachable (and I think that's already improved).
Can I become a social worker like that?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, addiction counselling or family help.
But I don't know if the actual working day is really the way I imagine it, and it's hard to find something on the Internet.
The AEVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about my code (again it's the simplest things) and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this myself by now"/"I keep him from working with my stupid questions"/"he must really think me to be under-mediated" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession but I wanted to mention it at the moment.
But you've already got the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pick-up.
What do you mean, give back, please?
If I downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) ingested with the food is broken down into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) in its gastrointestinal tract and is used to build up its own protein substances, which it also needs for plumage formation.
The formation of plumage in nestling and the formation of plumage in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and are particularly demanding for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply of NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be restored.

1 g NEKTON organic to 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
A coated measuring spoon (indicated) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In case of severe plumage damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of the plumage regeneration is visible.
The normal dose is then administered until the new plumage is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That's really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to announce that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Did you receive this e-mail?
Statement by a municipal employee in opposition to the statutes
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I've got this problem.
A walnut tree is to be cut down on our property.
So a case application was made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the fall of fruit trees and therefore the walnut is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo with no use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
yes, I think that, only the question is, if I can pay in euros and have the ceiling delivered to Germany
Can you check that out?
Rapid report: heavy traffic accident at Selb

According to the police's press alarm at the moment (14:03), a car has come into the oncoming traffic when it overtakes.
There are injuries.
Ah, okay, I get it.
Well, thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas on further working life
First, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good, because my dear head just shatters everything you can think of.
Before I pick up here now .. in short: I need advice and best of all from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm doing the ref as a cross starter right now.
Originally I studied something else and worked in an area there (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I don't call anything more specific here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up at the Magisterium and was sure that it is - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job advertisements".
And it's only been half a year.
At the times before, I always decided to go on and at least finish the ref, after that I can still turn around.
But right now, I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time for the last month that I'm completely drained.
Now it's vacation, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my quitting time.
That's when I was free.
And the stress at work didn't matter at the moment.
Now even the family party is too much stress for me.
And then there's those rigid structures that bother me in addition.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref is also running well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it shuts down completely - if it doesn't already.
I wonder if I want to have the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some contributions from you here - or if I should not go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take my free time when I needed them, and the work was somehow boring, but was properly paid for it and worked together in a team and not as a lone fighter like this is the case for most of the time.
But then I wonder if in a year I did not return to the same place as now and am dissatisfied.
You realize it's all kind of confused, but maybe as outsiders you have some advice or ideas, like me coming out of this situation that I'm completely done with and practically starting to cry at the smallest thought.
I'm not going to make decisions that emotionally right now, which probably doesn't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for now.
Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny undertone of me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has developed steadily, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the Valve Reactor circuit, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply achieve the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only spring.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then in order to meet new sound requirements, which led to a further boost in the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two loudspeakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists can find the maximum variety of sound here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced reproduction of game dynamics and string stop as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that above all the final stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic loses at Clippers
The Orlando Magic series of defeats in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven points by his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro dividers, it adapts to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for more lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for things that aren't photo-sensitive.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists dared no further prediction when it could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state-run TV station RTVE.
Millions of damage
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 residential buildings and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a layer of lava that was meter thick.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Outside the coast, two new headlands with a total area of about 50 hectares were formed by cold lava.
The banana production, which is extremely important for the island, was particularly affected, with about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants living directly or indirectly, and which was in crisis even before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely affected, the newspaper "El País" wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is coming, and especially the children will not be able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have something seductive in themselves, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of natural peoples", escapes the rigid routine and can be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas Became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the giving of gifts.
Previously, gifts were presented in one way or another on St. Nicholas' Day.
The background of this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women in their windows in one night in order to spare them another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the custom, popular in Germany, was to fill the boots with gifts, especially for the children.
Protestants stumbled upon this custom because they reject mediators between God and people as "holy worship".
For these reasons, they are against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christ Child out of St. Nicholas and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift was shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants do not see such detailed questions so closely, it is only a few people who are angry that the custom of St. Nicholas, similar to Martin's custom with Martinssingen and Martin's procession, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today you will find everything your heart desires in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources show a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was postponed to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian lands, however, there is a cheerful kuddelmuddel over the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christmas Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
This includes, for example, his white noise, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled drawn by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought some glory.
It's not reindeer here, it's three horses pulling his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christkind is responsible for the delivery of the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers reported a man who went into a bank with a gun and a bookie's shop.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials a little later.
Shots were fired and the man was shot.
He was declared dead at the crime scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
There are several embassies in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative lamp blends harmoniously into any bed, garden area or stone garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored to the ground with 2 spears.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Luminous time max. 10 hours
- The robust plastic version is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow inwardly in color.
On the other hand, »Smart Stone« is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly – optionally in white or coloured light (in equal six different shades of colour).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a natural shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also works well in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save big preparatory work: As a solar light »Smart Stone« doesn't need power supply or batteries.
Place the "lightstone" in any place that is illuminated by the sun.
Two supplied skewers ensure a firm hold if needed.
The matt white plastic cover itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides »Smart Stone« discreetly in its interior, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
At dawn, »Smart Stone« starts to shine automatically; in what colour, you decide for yourself: six attractive light colours are available for you – alongside daylight white.
The switch-off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a specified minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts from scratch the next day.
I've done that several times. It doesn't work.

Pill problem
Hello dear women's people,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and crappy PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave that again, because I have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
At my last two-year break, I had got explosive pimples from 0 to 100 and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it put a lot of strain on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
During the two-year break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid that this time.
My cosmetics are perfume-free and without mouths, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, gynaecologist didn't take me so seriously and dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, dear skin is such a thing.
Had pre-Bubertär bad neurodermatitis, then a time rest, then large nodular lichens and the acne theme.
Food I also tried everything possible in the course of chr. illness and got stuck on a sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed food, because nothing else worked so well.
It can also be good that the worm is just hormonal, but if you like me everywhere have construction site you don't want to go looking for anything else wrong.
I have already had everything from her colleague, Semina, etc.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I always have to work in between and on the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
what is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but there is it in general in large

110 kV ground cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high voltage cable at Tann is final.
The planning decision of the government of Lower Bavaria paves the way for construction, which is to begin in 2022.
This was now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The seven-kilometre underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived with us in parts.

Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have been at the Ref since summer, teaching is fun for me, but I still have big problems planning my lessons in geography time-efficiently at the moment.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
In the school I can only copy b/w free of charge (which is annoying for earth study).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and I actually stand for every hour.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to spend too much time on simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always go from the goal of learning (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can teach me how to work time-efficiently with the book.
I'd really love it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the #NUMBER# order.
I have actually already decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to do the return as soon as possible.
Trade fears about the 2G scheme for Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed.
Trading considers this to be unnecessary and complains of a drop in sales.
He also has a possible solution.
From the perspective of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for retailers.
In the case of non-daily articles, turnover drops were to be deplored, HDE Chief Executive Stefan Genth criticized.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without ground," Genth said.
Traders with 2G access restrictions thus lost almost a third of their pre-crisis numbers in the past week.
It only works well in the food retail as well as in the online area.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the general manager.
"2G shopping won't get us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required high personnel input.
The ribbon regulation had to be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer must be checked only once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops with the received ribbon on that day.
In addition, sample checks should be sufficient in the retail sector, as in the case of public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
Deutsche Euroshop, a real estate company specializing in shopping malls, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre-corona level, while the revenues were around 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of such important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, the Centers are trying to find and get approved solutions.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors can, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central location in the center and afterwards - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also a mistake, which was tried with a yellow filler to be concealed.
That's not nice.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back in the package and taped it.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the adjustment of the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on both the film set and the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the light in TV studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach locations.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage spaces, one of the memory keys is simply occupied and finished by pressing it longer.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that the known situation is again in the case of new switch-on - Very practical for studio work if e.g. the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester with built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right one on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlamp with continuous power via the supplied power supply.
The structure of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for attachment, so you can directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination shall be reliably adjusted by means of locking devices on both sides.
Care has been taken to ensure that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included.
Great is that also a bag is included in the delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might still want to buy without any problems.
Too bad I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a successful comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, Hessen was supposedly on its way to the next Bundesliga break-up.
But then the SGE turned up and, within a good hour, shot the frustration over a mixed start to the season from the soul and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys did today", coach Oliver Glasner cheered at DAZN and said a "pauschal praise, to each and every one who was there".
At the beginning, it looked like a further damper for the Frankfurters, now in ninth place, still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkusen with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," continued Glasner.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Even defenseman Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the court for the first time since the fourth match day and his overcome muscle injury, stressed the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result, especially for the audience.
That was the party we were gonna throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but also sees itself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professional.
Now they wanted to "continue and remain modest step by step" and to carry out the tasks "at this level" by the turn of the year.
Next on Wednesday in the course of the English week, an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18:30, Sky) will be on the programme.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it rerouted, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money has been transferred back and place the order again?
Would then unfortunately mean to me that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for handball women before quarter finals against Spain
Germany's handball women crept after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty looks from the parquet.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB-selection at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers won a severe defeat and now has to score against host Spain in the quarter final.
"We were far too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said Federal coach Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a pity we couldn't take the flow with us.
This was a bad game for all of us to erase," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for entry into the semi-finals, a significant increase has to be made against the second World Cup of 2019 next Tuesday in order to keep alive the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German thrower in a duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was back-space player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in the attack nor in the defense", admitted back-space player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We must now look quickly forward".
From front to back not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on the high with the kick-off.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 residue after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately on operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The DHB team scored the first goal after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick kick.
However, this was not the initial ignition hoped for.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes the German women could hardly put themselves in the limelight - and if they did, they mostly failed because of the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the game had run early at the 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since back-space player Mia Zschocke saw a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent also red.
However, she is allowed to participate again in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get a little better into the game and until the break at least to five goals.
The already only quiet hope for a catch-up after the change was already after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-arranged opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to pick up a performance increase and went off the grid as a clear loser.

The title is given, I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated, especially in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to a large extent finished, it goes on to some extent in vaccination centers for me.
I like to answer questions with no time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, if they are not related to you personally (e.g. "I take drug X, this is compatible with vaccination..").
In my area of responsibility, the information for vaccination, the indication status (person is entitled to a vaccination according to coronaimpfveveverordnung and no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
Vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, who are not able to carry out vaccinations (to be allowed?), so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Huidler" question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a "Huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television program "We in Bavaria" has been given a lot of thought.
However, unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained untried by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't a "person who's nervous."
And no one who "must go fast."
That, people heard from the TV presenter, is completely wrong.
To what the man from Amberg announced the solution and thus probably caused many Upper Palatinates to be amazed.
"The Huidler", the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven".
Dialectologist Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more familiar dialect word "Houdern".
Which closed an educational gap - probably also among many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books in two weeks.
It always comes after confirmation the following error message: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice on the road bike- really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy, because I wanted to train at least a little to prepare my bike tour in the coming week.
Said, done and I drove my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then that happened, what lurks in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to participate in the rest of the track.
Because I didn't have a real chance to get a replacement coat and a spare hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with a bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't that bad in terms of mood, maybe it's better if I practice the tyre change again before the bike tour.
But now I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days in front of me, I would be extremely reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, since also the old tires of the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike until 2 p.m. 120km tore off!) and who had already called it suboptimal, because he drove with them for several years on roll.
But if I remember that I have to change tyres after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I have come to talk with an older man at the platform, who asked me with amazement why I did not have the Marathon Plus tires; these should be unflattered.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so incapacitable?
I don't want to spend 40€/tires now, just to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I think I have 25x622 on the road bike right now.
Although there are also (apparently?) the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority of them are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me on other tyres on a road bike?
The Schwalbe-side seems to me absolute! Laiewissen rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and greetings!
Car slinging against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had hit a middle island on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for unexplained cause and then got onto the opposite lane, as the police reported.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high end wideband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also be able to grow up again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and visually reminds of the big role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitable designed foot directly to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
Due to the principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather minor role, but an exceptionally high level is to be achieved in sound.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered such large sound pressure levels.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears remarkably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned tonal with a slight rise in tweeters.
This is common for widebands in order to optimize the too high frequencies strongly increasing bundling.
Precisely aligned to the listening area, the SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the tweeter range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the positioning of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor sharp and astonishingly precise.
The reference-suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a fine dynamic that looks for its same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is recommended to start by thinking about the final appearance of the speaker in order to plan corresponding changes during construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the housings, the lowering of the speaker has to be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer applies material again.
After all plates have been cut (e.g. in the hardware store), one should first drill an 8 mm hole into the bottom plate at the appropriate place, in order to be able to carry out the cable there without any problems later.
With the help of an upper milling machine, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used flush later.
On the back side, this opening should be provided with a 45° chassis to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four bolting points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail Fase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
On these the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are glued.
The three stiffenings should also be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in the material thickness if required, if you want to use finished mouldings from the DIY store instead of making them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
The fitting of the openings of the bass reflex tube as well as the connection terminal on the rear wall is facilitated by a suitable hole circular saw or a Forstner drill.
Then a round cutter is used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the foot plate can also be rounded off.
Afterwards, the base plate is firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wooden screws.
It follows the drawing and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (sucking out / blowing out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
Push the entire and unabridged cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the foot to the terminal opening and let it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and it is also loosely suspended there.
The crossover is prepared and used below.
The construction plan of the crossover as well as the corresponding connection plan can be taken from the following document: Installation instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bassreflex opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and close it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus cable (marked cable) has to be soldered at the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to everyone,
> finally we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the line so that we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic – yet we'll do everything we can to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Get cold drinks, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
