Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
American President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma, the medal and a check of 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House will arrive tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the Northwegian metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First of all, he paid a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he met for the first time ever with the five committee members who elected him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The presidential couple then planned a meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its climax with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prestige prize.
He receives this as the fourth president of the United States, but only as the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already advised that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when he takes over the prize.
The President does not want to evade this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
A few days ago, he stepped up the war effort by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gol medal, the diploma and the cheque for ten million Swedish kroner (approx. 24 million Czech kroner).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The programme of events will include a banquet with the President and his wife, at which, besides Norway's king and queen, the Prime Minister and a further 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very cautious about the price from the beginning.
He said, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve the prize.
He also repeated several times that the price was not only for him, but for all those who aspire to the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he pointed out that this was for him "call to action".
Naturalists are accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the citizens' association "Kunstschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of extortion.
In several cases he filed appeals against some construction proceedings last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from the investors in his favor, said the Leitmeritz police spokesman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz Nature Conservation Community is Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he is in custody and he is threatened with a prison sentence of up to three years.
Sorting bulk containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague people can sort the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages you can find the sorting containers again at every step.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the suitable garbage cans.
I do not want to say that waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Councillors are not sufficiently concerned about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the waste separation in the primeval forest league, not only because we as citizens are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all because of the number of waste bins for such waste.
Have you ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket in the centre?
That's art. Above all, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far by chance is the Moravian square opposite the met goose.
Mr Onderka should not be annoyed by his colleagues, but that seems far too little to me.
Apart from the fact that the separation of waste is not honey in other parts.
Whole ranks of my friends therefore prefer not to sort the waste at all.
Out of laziness.
It's too far for them to reach the garbage cans.
I'm not surprised.
I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles even after the celebration.
But I didn't see any paint bins in sight on Konicova Street.
Fortunately, I came to the right place when driving a tram.
But the garbage almost ran over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leaves the Brno socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city a hockey league that shames us throughout the Republic, instead of buying a few more garbage cans and offering the sorting of additional raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics after searching the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno really is the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sick pay
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government's view, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, sick pay and construction savings.
But also not for the state debt interest or for the international court disputes.
This creates even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says the finance minister, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the salary increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money for sensitive expenditures, old-age pensions or for sick pay. "This is just a postponement of the problems in the future, laying mines," says Janota.
From the loans always higher interest is paid, and you have to refund the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, the state treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state enterprise are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later on for her children.
People don't have to be afraid that they'll get that money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state treasury, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will grow faster and faster, along with costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money to compensate, then the VAT will no longer be sufficient to increase only slightly or to reduce the maternity allowance, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
Due to the money transfer in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the development of motorways and railways.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be re-projected and possibly reduced in price.
At the very most, which is not free.
This means delay or cessation of thirty large buildings, the creation of European money is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it triggers the outflow of money in a Solomonic way - it attacks the CEZ stock dividends, where the state is the owner of the majority, and from them the money is then distributed into the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never safe and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, the budget of CEZ amounted to 18 billion.
Every year, the dividends are used to pay environmental compensation, to fill the pension account, and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, the EU rules also increase the actual budget deficit to the Nieveau of 5.7 percent GDP.
But this does not end the carnival of upheavals.
Nearly three billion fell in the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crime, or for expenses for court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can manage without this money is not certain.
It's pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, we'll have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The minister must then save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already begun two billion project "Staatsskasse", which is supposed to enable on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case, sanctions would come, warned Janota.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
The Americans expect a mobile phone for the future, on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to press only one key, and Windows Mobile will change Android within a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that the American company VMware wants to present, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for computers.
We enable you to run two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, suggested Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware during the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which the aforementioned systems Windows Mobile and Android ran simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working together with the European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and the devices are expected to reach the customer within 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains torments hotel owners
Scneeless slopes worry not only the Krkonoše inhabitants.
The lack of snow also deters people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve in Giant Mountains.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but in the meantime they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
Who wants the New Year's Eve stay in the spindle mill exactly according to his ideas, should no longer hesitate with the order.
If you prefer saving and the quality of your stay comes second, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will try to sell them for a while, but then they too will have to give in and go for shorter periods.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, Jandura estimated.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not sold out yet.
In our offer about half of the places is still free.
Therefore we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert, led.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest for winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
Should the slopes be snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and somewhat better than last year, the rooms at the Horizont Hotel in Pecpod Snezkou can be occupied.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also occupied by 80 percent for New Year's Eve stays at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free for Christmas at the newest hotel in Janske Lazne.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, for which we are currently occupied by about 60 percent.
February is now a little weaker, but at the moment when the snow comes, there is certainly also an interest in staying in the Krkonoše Mountains, led by the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
The Krkonoše hotel owners are now waiting for a larger snow cover.
On Thursday it should cool down and in case of rain, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove informed us about the warming.
USA: Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
It is almost strange with what student ardentness Barack Obama, the president with his reputation as the smartest, repeats his predecessor's strategy on the Afghanistan issue, which he himself considered to be the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his longingly-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it off about the copier from the Bush Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward Way" without hesitation.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea of sending out fresh troops in Iraq, which was plagued by the civil war, as an "irresponsible and in its conclusions carastrophic decision".
However, the months that followed showed that the Bush strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only possible and very successful one, and that the news about Iraq today no longer speaks at all.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, for objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting point than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
He was once again asked by the military, especially the commander-in-chief of Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite subordination habits, harshly criticized the squandering shooters in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't come up with a better idea, so he betrayed the general wenist by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he has pressed the promise for another 5,000, even though he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
Most problematic about the whole Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years.The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the fratricidal war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by the contraindication - no one can rely on it and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain only sham buildings behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to proliferate.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the ambiguities of the conditions that complicate the Pakistan and Iran influences even further.
It is also very unrealistic to build an "active state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation.
Time horizon of Obama’s strategy puzzled by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and now it is on the brink of an explosion.
To believe that the little soldiers, who broke out in the war cry about the "early homecoming", create a miracle here, can only a truly romantic soul, which cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date of withdrawal is irresponsibility, because the Taliban will accept this as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans’ willingness to participate in the battles in Afghanistan is running out.
Nor can and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu Kush Mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, a very serious question arises for the United States as to whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question must be answered during the period in which America moves to the winning withdrawal from Afghanistan after Obama.
However, any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years left until the presidential election, and so there is still enough time left for him to take a different strategy, which would prove to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive cash bonuses
The senior management of the American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive any premium bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which reacts to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of the money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from managers if they are overly risky.
According to the Reuters agency, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street's premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, the former banker of the company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after putting aside almost $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
According to the Reuters agency, the total amount of premium bonuses during this year will probably exceed 20 billion dollars despite the measure announced today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the bankers' bonuses, which exceed 25,000 pounds, with a one-time tax of 50 percent.
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except physics.
Today in Stockholm, five record women from the hands of the King of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf, have taken over this year's Nobel Prizes in subject categories and literature.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, was among them.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine together with their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosones.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarification of the ribosome structure and function.
The last Laureate was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, which American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman was awarded a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, have won this award for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chamberas, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and certificate of the acquisition of the money prize.
That amounts to ten million Swedish kroner in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the cash prize will be divided among them.
Traditionally, American President Barak Obama has already received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his journey, and he is also at the head of the country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are necessary for the struggle for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering his resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
On Friday morning, President Vaclav Klaus receives the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is thinking about his remaining in the government because he does not agree with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form approved by the Assembly of Representatives on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the remaining of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president's spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, about his remaining in his position.
According to the Budget Act, which now receives Klaus’ signature, the Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the Left-Party proposals for the circulation of money and increased the money for the civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democrats to covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party on the one hand and the Government, Klaus and the Right Party, on the other, a sharp domestic political dispute has arisen because of which the question mark arises about the further work of the Fischer Cabinet of Officials, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, will virtually liquidate the package of austerity measures imposed by the fishermen's government in the autumn, and that, according to them, should put an end to public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the state budget law, but does not have to, said today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected for a long time the "serious problem", which is the "untenable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is atrocious and that the government should weigh up its further existence.
The ODS deputy chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
Premier Fischer described similar words in the editorial office as "strong pronouncements".
The CSSD leader, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was horrific, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, exceeding 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, CSSD rated approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows the world much of the country, of its struggle and victories despite some criticisms that the leading role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sport, race conditions and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by the American Oscar actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela to show him in the Eastwood movie.
Another significant role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby" already represented the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which finally became a slave owner, a fictional US president, and also God in "Evan Allmight", but rarely someone who is still alive and as important as Mandela for many people.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active work in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time that is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was how he spoke
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that his people remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players, who are among the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team climbs up to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked on it for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to approach it as closely as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I noticed when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it's being transferred, and I had the feeling that I knew what you were feeling, he said.
It's important for me to have become another person.
Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team in which the white players outweighed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise to him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'In the movie I look much bigger'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and is also referred to as an Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his evaluation in the following words: "That was a very good story, a very well done film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light mystery about Norway dissolved: The Russians have tested a rocket
About Norway a special light effect of unknown origin was observed.
Only yesterday, the Russian Ministry of Defense acknowledged that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was not successful again and the rocket called the "Bulava" type, which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality as well as the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence at the rocket test also had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has mostly not been launched at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers one already writes about "Bulava" as about a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This already 13th attempt, went normal in the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred.
Probably the engine exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time "Bulava" started from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which sailed under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is probable that the mysterious light caused by an indeterminate flying object over north roads was actually the damaged "Bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian rocket.
This time, the generality has protected itself against it, claiming that one cannot clearly speak of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and the accident affected only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was made without errors, only six out of thirteen people in the Department of Defense consider it unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fills the generality with optimism and so it is maintained that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Vjatislav Fetisov introduces himself again in a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup owner helps his team CSKA Moscow out in need, and probably already competes in the Friday duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas got hurt, we urgently need another defensive player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only affect one game.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, Nemcinov performed.
When Fetisov comes back on the ice, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, winning 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles and he also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also scored in the NHL, where he twice topped the Stanley Cup in the Detroit Dressage.
He has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room since 2001.
Hyundai gave in to the unions. All overtime is cancelled
The management of Nosovice-Automobilfabrik Hyundai agreed with the union on the lifting of all overtime hours.
Due to frequent overtime, the union announced its willingness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not abandon our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday 19 December, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two working shifts would be worked, said Vanek.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The employees will also receive it in retrospect for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Vanek stated that either they can pay the overtime supplement or they can take replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the fare and lunch.
With regard to the fact that overtime was the most urgent and burning point with regard to demands and complaints from trade unionists who stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the lifting of all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk noted.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work 2 more hours every day after the eight-hour shift.
From the signing of the agreement, the unions' willingness to strike will be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists are scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they would be willing to lift the willingness to strike.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation in the automobile factory got worse, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of constant overtime.
They also protested against poor payment terms and alleged harassment.
On the other hand, the management considered that the employees had to make overtime to meet the automotive supply requirements.
The trade unionists also called for no sanctions to be imposed on the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday in their Monday strike statement.
In the area of overtime, the trade unions call for a minimum reduction in overtime work.
In addition, they are demanding the payment of 5000 kroner this year.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Serial production started at the company in November last year.
By this September, about 80,000 vehicles were produced here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works with ́stamped ́ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not have the same effect on common virus variants as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot yet be cured.
However, the drug composition can prolong life for patients and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus proliferation also results in the development of resistance viruses, against which no medicinal products are more effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, the VSHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way for dealing with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances called metalocarborans act on the protein that is responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
The metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus proliferation in a way other than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new ́improved ́ compounds, which were prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-faceted cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Subtle and persistent virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus division caused by the HIV protease, no mature infection virus particles would arise.
When we turn off HIV protease, we also turn off the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further modified.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the test tube, including against their resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as with the clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect on the resistance variants, against which the used drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formation, makes the metalocarborans interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fight over budget. ODS went off on Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "cruel" and the Prime Minister of Jan Fischer's government should in his opinion consider its further existence.
The Prime Minister described the statement of the ODS as "strong pronouncements".
There's supposed to be time for the analysis.
The Deputy ODS Chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials, with the support of the CSSD, the ODS and the Green Party, obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the left of Parliament.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, as Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the budget for 2010, but with Link Party amendments for more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants' salaries, the maintenance of social benefits and direct payments to farmers.
In doing so, the government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democrats to covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS left the Chamber before the vote, so it complied with the government's wish, because even the modified budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisional. Frase not clear
Disappointment and futility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, spoke about his disappointment and a sense of futility, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer argued that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign in case the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to Czech television, Janota signed up to the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
In doing so, he indicated that he was considering his remaining in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the negotiation of the budget.
According to Necas, the nominees of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who had enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government to what extent Fischer is in favour of the further fight with the budget deficit.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sick pay and pensions or the new service bill.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is a matter for the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make any mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the USA.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people sitting in a deputy position who are committed to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides not to fight the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he should rely on the majority of the left, which is currently in Parliament".
Then he is said to be unable to count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that is up to date, then I will deal with it, said defence minister Martin Bartak, nominated by the citizens' democrats, to the journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council in the afternoon.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the modified budget on Wednesday in Parliament if the Prime Minister specifically asked the citizens' democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he then responded to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back at the political negotiation on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice would be missing.
Even when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about Bolshevization of Parliament and destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will travel for about the same fare.
The Czech Railway will stop or restrict some less busy express and local trains from 13 December, while other connections will be reinforced.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared with today.
Most tariffs including basic and customer fare will not be changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area have several connections to the capital, while the railway uses Pendolino trains for this route.
The express train will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less express trains will also travel on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, as a matter of principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, but Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
There are also two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and a few days a week the operation of some express trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, which can be opened thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run within two hours.
The Pendolino has not allowed passengers to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's regional railway bill: 200 million increase
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, the railway will receive four billion kroner in order to pay the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, exactly as this year. The local trains will supply the districts with a total of eight billion kroner in the next year, whereby the state will increase three billion kroner.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the express trains, the railway has re-signed a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railways praise the system, and perhaps that is why they did not raise the price of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes are only made with CD Net one-day network tickets and with eLiska cheap internet tickets.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven pole, until now it was uniform for travel between any district cities and cost 160 kroner.
Philippine millitants arrest more than 50 people, the children were released.
Today, Millitante kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary school students and their teachers.
This is what the AFP agency said, which originally only informed about 65 people who had been kidnapped.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millitants allegedly used the hostages as a living shield to escape the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to release the remaining hostages.
According to the agency AFP, the millitants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the arms faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local famillienclans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right of stand was imposed for the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which coincided with the election to the governorship, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this South Filipino province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
But on Tuesday the peace negotiations with the Phillippin government resumed.
South Africa's history affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will be shown in the American cinemas "Invictus: the Unbeaten", which includes part of the life story of former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
With the release of the film, reactions from critics and the public also become loud.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize together with de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it comes to the cinemas at a time when South Africa, on the one hand, is culminating in preparations for the World Cup, but at the same time the media are shaking the world's public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination against the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are consistently positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the leading roles with American Hollywood stars.
In his own words, Morgan Freeman is nevertheless proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and prepared myself well for it.
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I could receive his energy, as they say, he performed in an interview after the premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good that we can remember Mandela's personality and his message with this film.
This is a story of South Africa, but it affects every human being, he added.
In the Rugby National Team Dress
The film is based on the novel by the British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the Role of the Enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people portrays the South African defender of human rights during his first presidential term.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two racial groups and each other since year and day, and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also appears in the World Cup field in South Africa in his role in the National Rugbydress, which was won by South Africa at the time.
For entering the lawn in dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations fourteen years ago, mainly from the white audience and has thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may bring people together to form a single people, led by rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve, that will only be shown.
The white South Africans are skeptical, however, as for example in a recent interview for LN the rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain, betrayed.
The championship starts on 11th June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million kroner
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the Ceps company in the switchgear near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the district fire brigade Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened in the fire.
Originally the fire brigade wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed its view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishers.
The cause was a technical defect, an internal transformer short circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the security operation of the management system according to the company spokesman, Pavla Mandova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million kroner, more precisely the damage will only be quantified after the fire.
According to Mandova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new transformer.
For over 10 years nothing similar has happened to the Ceps company, errors of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted according to the spokesperson of CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, and the fire of the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as the sole operator of the pipeline system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovated and develops 39 switchgears with 67 transformers, which transmits the electrical energy in distribution system and line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura is suing three heads of CSSD for defamation.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today filed a lawsuit for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint is related to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we are taking out the raisins, but we have submitted the offer only about the scope as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech railways, because we would know the prices of the Czech railways that were completed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he argued that he had evidence from all districts that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the lawsuit to be a continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that it will also become clear on this matter that it is Jancura who is manipulating the public and using lying and untrue arguments in the matter of regional rail transport, said Hasek.
Jancura already reported last week that he has invested several million kroner in the advertising, which will point to the disadvantageous step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and continue it after the New Year.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts had agreed on regional rail transport with the Czech Railway and had not tendered for the order at a height of around 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train traffic in the districts, according to Jancura, he was also threatened by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn't give up the fact that we could also lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, said Jancura to the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococci free and voluntary
Immung against pneumococci changes the familiar from January.
It is said to be the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But voices are already reporting that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci culminate.
The medicine institute already sets the maximum prices of the vaccines, which the health insurances have to pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a dose of vaccine.
Those who have already started vaccination in the last year or earlier must also pay for further vaccination themselves.
The first dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th months of life of the child.
A quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci last year.
The parents paid 1600 kroner and more for one dose.
Vaccination of the youngest children requires four doses.
On the whole, the experts estimate that the health insurances spend 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year for the vaccination doses.
However, they save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
Up to now, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all children's area vaccinations.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear infection, but also severe infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill up to 28 children up to 10 years of age per year in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococci was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, this is to be paid by the insurance companies and be voluntary.
For example, Rudolf Kalovsky, head of Nahlas, mentioned that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference, in which our association was involved, were not very pleased with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to achieve this at least.
I believe that this is the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment we are not considering this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, the doctors claim.
Hana Cabrnochova, Chairman of the Association of Pediatricians, admits that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children had been vaccinated, then one could think about the reduction in the number of re-vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one," says Cabrnochova, however.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their babies vaccinated against pneumococci next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in the fact that it is the first vaccination to be paid by health insurance and not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, thus saving them for further treatment, explains Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is linked to a concern of the practical pediatricians, which concerns the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be bought by the insurance companies and the doctors should then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued by the state to them.
However, some MEPs feared that the insurance companies could "take the money out of health insurance".
That is why doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artist son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum.
According to Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle with a trailer.
They say Frank Frazetta Jr. and another man used an excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
According to the Associated Press, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP cited an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior might have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police affidavit, that Frazetta Junior was instructed by his father to "enter the museum by all means to bring all the paintings into a camp."
The agency announced that Frank Frazetta senior denied any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending freezes announced in the preliminary report against the criticisms of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
Conservatives said that Alistair Darling had "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing decisions out until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Treasury was also under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 per cent increase in social security and a 1 per cent capping of public wage settlements for 2011.
Social security insurers
Trade unions have protested that low-wage earners will be punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned of impending "problems".
The rise in social security - to about £3 billion a year - has upset the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than £20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
VIEWS OF THE PREVIOUS EVALUATION REPORT
Increase in social security by a further 0.5% from April 2011
Economic decline this year by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
1 percent increase in corporation tax for small businesses discarded
Tax reductions for electric vehicles and wind turbines
2.5% increase in public pensions
According to estimates by the Treasury, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be £90 per year poorer and someone with £40,000 per year will be £190 poorer, while a person with an annual income of £10,000 will be £110 richer.
Ministers said their target of deficit halving by 2013 was "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would be on the 5% of top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax increases and spending freezes outlined would be "a drop in the ocean" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big figures. They will bring us the deficit halving and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour’s predictions of future economic growth – affecting the scale of new debt and the speed of deficit reduction – were questioned after the Treasury Chancellor was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year – far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while the debt would be £3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"Missed opportunity"
Conservatives who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour's "debt crisis" said that the planned £789 billion in debt over the next six years is unsustainable.
They added that ministers have failed to present a credible plan of how to repay this and "cynically" press ahead with difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place by June 2010 at the latest.
"They didn't say anything about what they were going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this and they let them pass by."
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police are protected from future cuts, unlike in the Conservative proposals, which see deficit capping coming faster and sooner.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by tax increases and spending freezes is used to cover next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand."
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that at the time of the announcements – such as the above inflation adjustment for some invalidity pensions next April – some would expose the Chancellor of the Treasury to the charge of winning votes, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra assistance when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hollow budget"
Although ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only come to fruition in the medium term.
The recognized Institute of Tax Investigations said that the figures of the Chancellor of the Treasury would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly also in the future in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his head Robert Chote.
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, an accountant at the Deloitte audit firm.
"This was only the hollow preliminary budget report. The markets recognize this."
FBI Investigates "Fighting of US Citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Panjab province, and the American embassy in Pakistan informed the BBC.
The FBI said it's being investigated if they're the same men who've been reported missing last month in the state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are believed to be Pakistani, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are accused of and under what circumstances they are held," said Spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweitt said the agency was informed of the arrests and was in contact with the missing students' families.
"We're working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if it's actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house owned by the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had been interested in the house before and that no charges had been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but said that the US "must work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "abuses" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, human rights in Iran is still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report details "abuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report stated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said that he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the biggest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens were sentenced to prison, and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests, the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Detention Centre.
But since then there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, said our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the election results.
"They often slapped me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, told Amnesty.
The beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses have taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained in a container in a detention centre in Kahrizak for more than eight weeks with 75 others.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's reactions to it, but Amnesty said that the mandates and power of these bodies were unclear and that the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people were arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang has been set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competition runway.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prizes.
On the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short ski jump at the beginning of a 100-metre long slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that glitter below.
He added, "There are some of the country's best skiers and snowboarders here - some real talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best works of art or tricks performed on the hillside.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted in favour of a construction ban on minarets and there is widespread concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-thought-out report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most declaredly secularized societies in Europe — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (2006), an elegant and well-argued study of an issue that divided and occupied the country for over a decade and a half and whose effects can still be seen today.
Bowen's latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic freedom".
He is a good listener, he reflects debates between teachers and students about the questions that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or city hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, that make up daily life, quite unlike the political dramas that occupy the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arabic-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists whom Bowen questioned are usually divided with their Salafi counterparts – advocates of purist Sunni Islam, which is related to Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who in turn had to make their historical compromise with secular republicanism.
He sees a "enhancement of the value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The bleakest outlook in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes it melts with alarming speed and takes life with it that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have recently gone into the open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Accompanied by the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in hunting the polar bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign at sea, who only fought with the rifle butt of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have one millionth of the life area of a wild animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore became quite green from the algae that grow in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America, and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters use powerful assault rifles in helicopters and motor sledging Inuit to hunt down their prey.
Ironically, the ice will last the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
But this is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneer journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century made for the first time the whirling of the pack ice guess.
Undersea boats in the Cold War the shifting ridges during the underpass.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale application of probes on icebergs, but much is still achieved by intrepid people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by salt water channel compressed when frozen.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic miracles in the ice, all are threatened if the summer ice once passes, which is expected in the period between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... the We could be"
Marines were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths in Arlington
Captain De'Angello Robinson travelled seven hours by bus to place a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other naval infantrymen who took the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they followed.
In a few months, from where we are brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd wish someone would do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this journey every year, stop in different cities along the way to carry out events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other countries.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths on the tombs at Arlington Cemetery, in areas near the Pentagon, at the tombs of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at the Memorial of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of returning something to those who made sacrifices.
She said that this is a small contribution to how we can support civilians in our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the vast lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War as a goal, since these are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held each other's hands as they carried the fresh pine branches to the greying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red bow attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the bleak mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends held together in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black and white maps, which had been put in the damp mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the burial site of Marine Infantry Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been around for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractor of the U.S. government arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, State Department representatives said on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials from the US interest group in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the charge of "hazard".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro brothers' Communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a "slow" rapprochement to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new US policy attaches importance to the United States providing compensation if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought after products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is 15 dollars per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, and they are mainly used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a day's pay.
Internet usage on the island is extremely limited.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesperson of the U.S. representation in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the surrender of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", which recently produced a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, same Cuba", an allusion to the appointment of Raul Castro as leader of the country that replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned within one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials uncover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, saying that they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after finding them because one of them had made YouTube comments on terrorist attacks on the internet video page.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after her arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, which is home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was briefed on the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest that have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations in order to gain access to the Al Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani prison authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underscores the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and possibly even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the US intelligence service has made it a matter of utmost urgency to house human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as porters who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are subject to a special test by A Qaeda, analysts said.
However, because of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered immensely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the highest ranking analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the USA, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they allow access, because the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to get someone into these groups, what better way could you go than following the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators call for climate "action" in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded bolder action on climate protection from negotiators at the Bella Congress Centre in the city.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to be about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosives near some government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened at the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists marched through the city with banners saying "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish saying "The Earth says "Enough."
Some stars joined the protest, such as the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travelling to Peru, her mother's country of birth, would make her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country is facing due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That is part of the motivation why I decided to participate in the big demonstration - to pass on the word and appeal to the world leaders to reach a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around it anymore.
The police stopped the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be mentioned because he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing lit several explosive devices near the Copenhagen Main Canal, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they began as flares, but then followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of TV screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest apparently did not reach the consciousness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiators.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not even aware of."
He then went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it depends on the individual's perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disturb the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent race gap
The math record last week was welcome good news for the Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the country’s high-performance schools, the evidence shows that the fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress in the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what is included in the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African American and white students, both at local and national levels.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but that of their African American peers rose only by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American eighth graders remained basically the same, falling at a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data, as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap separating white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district was 60 scales (262 to 202).
And even though the score reached by children of both groups has increased in this period of time, the difference has hardly decreased with now 58 points.
Some of the district's educational advocates expressed concern last week that the results celebrated by Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were largely driven by white students who are already powerful children.
This indicates that we have raised the overall ranking by treating those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group advocating educational equality in Washington D.C..
I'm not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points, said Democratic Washington City Councilman, Kwame R. Brown, who has a fourth grade daughter at Eaton Primary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of exam scores is that the city's middle schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what scares me is that we don't spend nearly the time and energy we need to spend on our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson reading system, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and middle school, who have not mastered the basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school career and who are significantly behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games and lifelike experiences from kindergarten to sixth grade, was brought to Washington under the former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progresses reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to make the best measures available to students below grade level, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performing schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, who is investigating urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could give rise to political repercussions which are working against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, is that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighbourhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a Newark school inspector, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements to closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to about 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement last year with his teachers' union over 185 days a year, which he regards as "a milestone" on the way to a larger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than prospects for the future
The coach reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, steps out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents barely finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was recovered in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight-year-olds of the group, who explore Gettysburg, where teaching costs 38,690 dollars a year, was rather that of an awe-inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I will be here soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the Führer announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told the low professor-to-student ratio of the school.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully accepted the intended message: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to get into the middle class.
In fact, one in five of this "second generation" of Hispanics completes college – which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having completed high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who study powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an intrinsic drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like her to get to college, especially if these efforts persist over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied Hispanic American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from preschool to high school.
The federal program funded by Gracielas College Tour is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - turn up a gear - and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue to run until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of whom more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraq Oil Ministry signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to re-establish its damaged infrastructure at two auctions closed on Saturday.
The ten contracts signed with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi oil ministry suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that made a bid has cut the gap.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for auctioned fields in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil multinationals at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies, Asians and Europeans pretend the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no more offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability through the withdrawal of the US military, have likely prevented American oil companies, analysts said, from getting more involved in Iraq, which has the world's third largest proven crude oil reserves.
US companies have been disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to enter into contracts with the ministry.
Major US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have close relations with the Iraqi oil ministry and have served with technical advice in recent years, have gone out empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman for the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the greats of the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can compete with its competitors and will fulfil its obligations to Iraq.
Companies preselected for bidding bids were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil that the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of Al Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan
An obvious US missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan is said to have killed a top Al Qaeda operative this week, according to US counter-terrorism officials on Friday.
This would, if it were confirmed, be the second deadly attack on a senior terrorist operative this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani officials, were reportedly killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in northern Waziristan province on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the rockets were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civilian secret service official from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of being militants ran to the site and quickly took all that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
The local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US counter-terrorism campaign cited indeterminate evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of Al Qaeda, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noticed a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate nature of the US airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
If one assumes its central role as given, this also included the planning of attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and put them into operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali quickly rose in the Al Qaeda hierarchy and maintained best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this does not in any way reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading al-Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September when Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other top activists were killed in a similar attack.
The rate of attacks by CIA drones has declined from an average of six operations per month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability and at the same time brutally kill suspected informants, the site reported.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul to resign
Kai Eide, the leading UN envoy to Afghanistan, said on Friday that he would resign from office in March, ending a stormy term clouded by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
The Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he was supporting the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concern that the US military withdrawal schedule, which is expected to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We must speed up the construction of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help in the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign from office, but only fulfilled an agreement with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to the UN.
President. — The next item is the report (Doc.
What I said was that he better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban, according to UN representatives, has begun to search for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he took into account the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eid's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - who was fired - "had undoubtedly caused damage to the mission because there was already a great deal of scepticism about international interference in the election."
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to recruit more personnel from the United States and other Western countries to contribute to the Afghan mission, saying that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN recruitment arrangements have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I could only hire one person.
This is catastrophic and must not go on like this.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in talks about his nuclear plans.
During a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and played down the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, he said, there are no good options to choose from in answer to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things on my mind is, if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, the unpredictability of war."
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions may also affect the average Iranian.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed to "convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer tremendously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined European leaders in warning that if Iran does not comply with the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear surveillance agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran will have to face up to "credible" consequences.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology is to be gained only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume talks to restrict its nuclear programme and renounce a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since that time -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees as to whether they should commit to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international community standing in relation to some of the proposals it had already agreed to at the beginning of October has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way that they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set the deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals by 31 Dec. before pursuing other options, including those once called "impressive sanctions" by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In a statement issued in New York, Iran's representation at the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday "groundless and unfounded claims" of some Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities, saying that they are ready to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "in order to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, in particular with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent delays in US plans to reduce American troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel Kurdish concerns about the forthcoming withdrawal of troops. US representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A Change of Prices in Older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters giving lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "One more baby means one more grave."
They learned these lessons so well that when government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly started to change the course this summer due to the low birth rate and the ageing population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and final: "No way."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There's nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a head of staff with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, spoiled single children, who are affectionately called "little emperors", a population crisis in the country is raising.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN
Department of Population Issues, while the number of population groups from 60 years of age and older in 2020 is projected to increase from 16.7 percent of the population to 31.1 percent by 2050, well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with an educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and olders accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai's reported residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples of childbearing age need to have babies to "help reduce the ratio of older populations and alleviate the labour shortage of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the developed countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A Gradual Relaxation
Incorporated in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial order introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Married couples who violate this policy have to face enormous fines -- up to their three-year salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their jobs.
Chinese state representatives have attributed it to this policy that the critical use of natural land resources could be avoided, while human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to have an abortion.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards one-child politics.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife have been single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many harsh slogans was mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing University's Department of Population Research, said that government officials recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with whom a partner is an only child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city in July to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent out municipal employees and family planning volunteers to visit couples at home and to pass through information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice to those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not exactly encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing Response
Although officials from a rural small town in the outdoor areas of Shanghai said that there was an upswing in the applications of couples who wanted a second child after the start of the campaign, the urban districts did not report any change.
For the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, as an example, only four to five applications are received per month.
Deceived Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the expected number of births in the city in 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Shanghai Caolu Community Family Planning Committee, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give the best to their first one, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that they were legally allowed to do so.
But, like many Chinese, they have only a small health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we're being robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for her hesitation.
Wang, the head of staff, said she only wanted a child because she was an only child. "We were the center of the family and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and do not really want to do so."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it bluntly.
For middle-class parents with a double career, which lowers the birth rate, he said, it's about being successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The age group of 20 to 39 years old grew up to see their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalist experiment and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the question of space -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you already have to have a CV for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group drafts emission reduction plan
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been marked by wild poses and mutual accusations -- again focused on Friday with the publication of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrial nations shouldering the greatest burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has highlighted both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that runs out of time, as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how developed and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and what should be the upper limit of the global temperature rise that policymakers would share.
The process is given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, called "the big picture".
It shows the outline of a possible agreement in which the industrialised nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent in the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the talks on Friday a boost through its commitment to provide 3.6 billion US dollars per year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change, from the mastery of floods and droughts to the prevention of deforestation.
Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks that the talks last week had determined.
The US Climate Special Representative Todd Stern has rejected formulations that require binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if they are not financed by the industrialised nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration is running a tougher line with China than representatives of the Bush administration less than two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging economies getting up and taking action, says Stern, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern issued his statement an hour after the statement by Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei, saying that the leading American climate negotiator either lacked "reason" or was "highly irresponsible" of him saying earlier this week that the United States would not help China financially to master global warming.
Because the future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake, break lines have opened up both within the industrialised nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle is about saving individual economies as well as saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting for their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the big powers are struggling to find out who should bear the cost of slowing down greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have gone to act more aggressively to hold the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, says Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change stated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leaders say that the talks will best lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page draft contract early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who is leading the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states is exerting "political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand measures from emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks were given a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues had to be resolved before the arrival of the leaders in order to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice-Minister, got off their planes and raced through the Bella Center corridors to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to stake out claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The sheer size of the gathering -- 13,000 people go in and out of the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists do night shows in which they make fun of the countries that they think are betraying and selling themselves, and draft contracts are passed on from hand to hand instead of by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Politics of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Great Britain's first 225 km/h fast train redefines Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5:13 a whistle will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that is a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will travel from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras 225 km/h and cover 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin commuter service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international rail network with fast, reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter cities, working hours would be radically reduced, and switching from aircraft and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and road congestion.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network could still slow down the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage in the British high-speed railways.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis will hand over the report to the Times on December 30.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which will connect London with the West Midlands, will pass urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial, with a five-metre travel space.
In the open ground, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final track.
HS2 will also provide three options for a larger, north-facing high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed line would lead to the West Midlands.
The line would split in or near Birmingham and a branch west of the Pennines would lead to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to travel the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today's slightly over an hour.
The drafts would allow trains to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can travel on it.
Up to 18 trains could operate on the London-Birmingham line per hour.
This, in turn, would mean that a terminal in London would be needed to handle 20,000 travellers per hour.
Given the geographical constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be taken after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed lines to existing lines in the north of Birmingham, thus continuing to travel more than three hours between London and Scotland.
This is seen as a crucial key point to ensure a change from aircraft to rail, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay for mortgage for 75,000 pounds of a conservative’s orangery
Alan Duncan, the Conservative leader in the House of Commons, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had built in his home in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron because he complained that members of the House of Commons had to live "on lean rations," increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak-timbered annex to his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The leaders of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is carrying out a review of the expenses of the Members of the House of Commons. Last night Duncan said that the applications could not have been "more clean or understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control center of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he cultivated a conservatory, which is called "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described it as a "glass house for entertainment".
Even during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts, Duncan was not invited by the Standards and Privileges Committee to comment on the increased borrowing.
The Committee acquitted him of the breach of the rules last month, following an investigation into his expenditure.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London home to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election as a Member of Parliament.
Documents published this week show that Duncan received approximately 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) a month as mortgage interest by March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the total increase served to finance the borrowing of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it is still standing.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim his right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month this May.
Duncan lost his post as opposition leader in the House of Commons in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending scandal that MPs would live "on lean rations."
"In essence, working for the state means living on lean rations and being treated like S*****e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden, and I claim a small portion, measured by what is right.
And I could have claimed all the fucking money, but I don't."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May because of his spending when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before he had clarified with the Fees Office that this "could be regarded as an excessive demand".
An activist, as a protest in Duncan's lawn, dug a hole in the shape of a pound mark after it became known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When asked about the raised mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This had been approved by the Fees Office as well as subsequently by Legg to increase the value."
He added: "There is no debate about evading and squeezing or bending the rules or anything like that.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer."
Come all you believers to admire Brighton's beach huts Advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that inspires spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas carols as a theme.
The event started on 1 December and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free mulled wine and traditional mint pies, pastries filled with dried fruits.
The Christmas carols selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary clergyman of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and organize exciting celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and lively place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people around the world and in Copenhagen demonstrated on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, where the police have made hundreds of arrests.
At least thirty thousand people according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations climate conference, which was to lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the climate conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for the climate contributes to this, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed by, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Anti-ruling police officers intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your assessment, mainly members of "the Blacks Blocs", of these extremely violent splinter groups, who have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in eastern France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested "without distinction", and has underlined that about one hundred of them "were still held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in sitting position.
The rather peaceful train has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers, for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators have come from the major European cities with busts and trains, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky-blue raincoats, have made a first casserole in the morning in Copenhagen, as you have followed the call of Earth's friends to make "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today we are going on the streets to demand a reparation of the ecological guilt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filippin activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot go on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry up, watercourses where you can walk, as it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN agreement, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organizations.
Euro MP José Bové, the figure of globalization critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are at particular risk as a result of warming, has given the start to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people have taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila there were several hundreds of people, mostly students, who marched in red and raised bandanas, in which you boasted the solar energy.
In Hong Kong, or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred demonstrators marched to demand a vigorous approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the "350" network have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseilles (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia has denounced that this is a "strike".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilissi denounced the "strike".
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory that was recognized by Russia.
The polling stations are closed at 5pm GMT.
Voter turnout was around 58% a few hours before the polling station closed, according to the Abkhaz electoral commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous President, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian occupation and has declared his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating itself from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with thousands of people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have voted for Mr. Bagapch, has declared.
She was one of the voters who went to vote in a polling station located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful black sea landscapes.
Big signs on which Bagapch can be seen alongside the Russian president and head of government, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the conduct of the elections.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to Moscow's support, especially with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazian independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, for its part, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements made with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia left Russia control of the railroad for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims neither to support the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated throughout the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, ready to use at any time, arrested about 700 people at the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which receives delegates from 193 countries who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the centre and did not try to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of demonstrators, all dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to smash windows, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Anti-Unruhe police immediately circled you and intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent factions that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, during the incidents, in which about twenty people were provisionally arrested according to the police, a policeman suffered an injury from a cobblestone on his chin. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said the spokesman of the police, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the police were circling in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who travelled by train or by their own vehicle from German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky-blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are taking to the streets to demand that the environmental debt be repaid to the people of the South," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't tell each other any more: we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that dry up, there are watercourses through which you can walk, which was never the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalist movement has approached environmental organizations.
The French MEP and globalization critic José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world today."
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organisers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students dressed in red with bandanas, have made advertisements for solar energy in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital.
Hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in Hong Kong and Djakarta in an action against climate change.
In France several hundred people joined forces during the demonstrations organized by the "Network of 350", especially in Paris, Marseilles in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyons in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the Lycéen.
National Minister of Education Luc Chatel explained in an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" that the subjects geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the Lycées, even if they are not taught in the terminal (12th school year).
"The pupils of the Première (11th school year) now have every four hours of the week and the same program," confirms Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but on the whole a concentration of "the best student."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific profile," he continued. He stressed: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who have been outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lycees."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that almost seven out of ten French (69%) are criticising the government's project to abolish compulsory teaching in history and geography in Terminale S (12th school year with a scientific profile), and many teachers and intellectuals also criticised this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of the Terminale S.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which in their opinion was the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that they were subject to a subject-related aptitude test in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and an admission test at the end of the year, during which their teaching skills are being tested.
They also do internships in the M2 during the year and then teach as a teacher in the internship one year before the students.
He continued: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance test, you will reach even more hours that you have spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The Minister finally stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed again that he wants to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, faced on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
According to a journalist from the AFP, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts each turn to the audience for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organisers of this day, explained that one would like to do something to reach people and make them feel like they want to learn more. The name of this event goes back to the name given by the students to fish in the school's basin.
"Among the experts, around twenty participants were selected, also according to their charisma," he explains.
"You can talk about global warming for hours, but the core goals can also be set out in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke freely to about 50 people only with the help of slides.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the audience might conclude that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be available online on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Late payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the prison officials' unions called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons, were paid before Christmas holidays.
The 2nd union of prison officials ("FO-Pénitentiaire") called on the employees who have no service to demonstrate in front of the detention centre on Tuesday morning and to block them in order to draw attention to the "theft of what they deserve".
The 3rd union of prison officials ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "to unite in a strong mobilization in the various prisons" on which the non-payment of overtime, night allowances and Sunday and holiday allowances incurred in October will be branded as "harmful and unacceptable" in December.
The first union of prison officials, the Autonomous Federal Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show discontent and anger."
The head of the prison and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime had risen sharply in 2009 and not all were included in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining demands will be paid in January.
According to the Ministry of Justice in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the prison officials' unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
"I know very well about the efforts of the staff to keep our prison system functional and modern", the Minister of Justice informs in this letter.
"I have instructed the head of the prison to take immediate action so that such a situation, which has arisen due to a lack of assessment of the resulting overtime, will not be repeated in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
Thus, the December wage is low, except for the management staff, who benefit from high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains, for which the "household constraints" must hold.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade union FO in Marseilles is outraged and announces that it will boycott "all meetings and convocations" up to new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and public holidays, if the hours of October are still not paid in December. This also applies to their overtime," also threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being imposed on us without more staff being recruited, the attempt to enrich the staff's funds is more than inappropriate," says the Bordeaux CGT union.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, states the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that he always gives Christmas better gifts than he himself gets.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, told TV talk master Oprah Winfrey that he is always giving better gifts than he himself gets.
During a special show broadcast on Sunday evening on ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be part of the game.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," Michelle Obama affirms, adding that the dog will of course also get a gift.
Michelle Obama resolutely rejected her husband's claims on the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she teases the president.
"So please," he shammed her and pointed to the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour show in a casual atmosphere with the well-known TV presenter, whom Barack Obama had so vehemently supported during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts that they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten gears and also a basketball that his father, whom he very rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father visited us once at Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"Not until much later in my life did I understand that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady, for her part, remembered her doll house.
"I didn't know at all how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday operated again, RTL confirmed that he was transferred to an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated on in Los Angeles for considerable "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was again operated on the night of Wednesday Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, after the American doctors found "damage as a result of the operation of a herniated disc" which he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damages would have required a new operation.
The production company of the singer nevertheless wanted to make it clear that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical report would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
However, it was only after 48 hours that there was a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of AFP, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources it emerges" that after his first operation in Paris "no drainage" was laid.
The rocker had been operated on in the international clinic of Parc Monceau due to a herniated disc.
The surgery, scheduled for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had treated many stars.
This was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday evening.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the surgery.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, felt to RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through a "deep valley". He assured, however, that you don't have to worry about the rock musician, since he is "a good fighter".
"He called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was bullshit to get on a plane for 12 hours after such an operation," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer Jean-Claude Camus confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection is contained".
Mr Camus also explained that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not felt any particular concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the singer's health had grown ever since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general amazement of the fact that Johnny Hallyday had a "small colorectal cancer surgery", there was a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour as planned.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists have not escaped that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the people around him had to deny a return to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Shorttrack: First place for Bousquet over his favourite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title about his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while one had expected a real record flood.
A record was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 m positions of men.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to grab the world record in the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the large basin (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman asserted himself in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere on an international level.
Bousquet defeated the Croats Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russians Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in always greater things, and in this case, I said, if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all floats started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which started in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination did not pay off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two times world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has won the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," explained Biedermann.
USA : Tomb at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman tombstone, which appeared with the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated to be 1.5 million US dollars above its value on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two metres long and 63 cm high. It dates from the third century AD and has always been valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysus are depicted in a sophisticated architectural decor surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," explained Florent Heintz, vice president for the sale of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday opposite the AFP.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still going on, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered the most so far," says Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy to AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom at her Paris hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
While searching the Louvre's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on domestic soil no longer compatible after this escort by the coup government had rejected as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place at night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, said Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authorities, the plane, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer of M. Zelaya, had returned to its place of departure.
The coup government wanted to force M. Zelaya to "decide" and ask for political asylum under escort for him abroad.
The overthrown President, however, refused to do so, as he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcoming, acting head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered another failure by trying to get me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to give up," said M. Zelaya to Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has spoken frequently since the beginning of the political crisis, which has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the overthrown president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under a few chords.
The Mexican Embassy has submitted to us a request for escort, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, since it does not include a request for asylum, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Interior Minister of the Putsch government, told Honduran Radio HRN.
I did not ask for asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had underlined, would only take place as president of the Honduran people.
On Wednesday, the rumors of M. Zelaya's departure had mobilized the supporters of the overthrown president, who had opened up to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, and the local military had intensified its efforts.
The Brazilian foreign minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international norms.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, on the day of the referendum he organized in preparation for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica he had returned surprisingly on September 21st and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he is arrested for high treason, which he is accused of by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
The coup president Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organising a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, the Cogress had voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street upswing, US trade balance nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday with a high, the figures of the American trade balance testify to a price recovery of the United States shares and their partners: the Dow Jones increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at the close of the stock exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, while the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, has risen from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor ́s 500 index was written at 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There is good news from various industries, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial judged.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market is focused only on "half-full glasses", so it moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on the figures of the American trade balance, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States’ trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October compared with September.
By contrast, analysts had expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, which reflects the economic growth of the main trade partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of the business research economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States rose in the last week against all expectations and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, during the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has "falled to the low of the year," stressed Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market is down.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has risen to 3.482 % compared to the 3.432 % on Tuesday evening, while the profitability of bonds to 30 years to 4.492 % compared to the 4.408 % on the eve.
Cuba: Hundreds of Partisans standing in power whistle "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, several hundreds of partisans standing in Cuban power whistled out the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of World Human Rights Day and also thwarted another rally, which temporarily arrested a dozen dissidents.
Around the forty "women in white", wives or close-up political prisoners, were whistled out on the street by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on the march to the center of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, confirmed a journalist of the AFP.
Down with the Yankies!, "Merceners!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "There live Fidel and Raul!" chanted the authorized partisans with a raised fist to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civil agents who had appeared to "guarantee their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Women in White" had taken place in Havana the night before, where there were no casualties or arrests.
In the havann district of Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also took part in the demonstration held on Thursday in the face of International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civil police, a reporter from the AFP confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police forced the dissidents booed by the partisans of the government to enter civilian vehicles using force.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As a candidate for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the Women in White organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of "the request for the release of all political prisoners", the number of which according to the list of dissidents is around 200, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a prison sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda is a member of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, 53 of whom have been behind bars to date.
The Cuban authorities see the opponents of the regime as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared arch-enemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "contra-revolutionaries."
Cuba, led by a united party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of defaming rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Madman kills eighty-year-olds with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A maniac armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old and injured five more people on Friday, late afternoon, during the main business hours in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine).
According to the first information in the interview, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old from a previously unexplained cause in or in front of a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives, according to police records, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, was killed in the hospital, according to a person in charge of the police syndicate Alliance.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he has a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were sent to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life because, according to police sources, apparently vital organs were affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in a "shock state" according to a police source.
The armed man, who according to police reports seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, immediately escaped to the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two more passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, with the latter severely.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher knives, which he crossed behind his back, explained on site Arnaud Pressé, a head of the Alliance Syndicate of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passers-by, including youths, are reported to have tried to tame the madman, according to the witness reports investigated by the AFP.
I saw a guy in the thirties with a green vest.
Three young people tried to intervene.
They couldn't make it because the guy was well built, reported Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A horde has fallen upon him, he added, among them a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61, two city police officers, including their superiors, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with stab wounds, according to police reports.
The event took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are a number of shops.
Passersby came to me to tell me there's an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put her in first aid position and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach area, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person was injured by cuts.
Police forces finally arrested the man who did not carry identification papers.
The prosecutor's office of Nanterre commissioned the district department of the criminal police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The maniac was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard.
A police source does not rule out his being sent to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, there were six police officers to tame him at the police station in Clichy, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" like "all the spiritually confused of this kind, in which the forces release themselves during the course of the action".
USA: Polanski’s lawyer calls for law enforcement to cease again
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) to drop the prosecution against his client, who is currently in court at his home in Switzerland due to a moral violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", denounced gross trial errors in 1977 before three judges of the Court of Appeal in the second district of California.
On the spot, I demand remission, M. Hummel explained, before he added, that the behavior of the judge appointed at the time of the trial with the case Laurence Rittenband "let it run cold down your back".
According to him, the judge Rittenband, who had died in the meantime, had discussed before he made his verdict with a prosecutor who allegedly told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which was a serious procedural mistake.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and wanted" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), especially by the prosecutor David Wells.
At the end of September, M. Wells had finally declared that he had " lied" to the authors of the documentary.
If the Court refuses to close the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel asks for the conduct of a trial which would enable him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, has repeated the evidence already expounded in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the lifting of the facts charged to the defendant cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the USA in 1978, even before the sentence was issued for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
Since then, he has not travelled to the USA.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants who are a means of escape?, asks Ms. Asayma.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the Court for a favor and thus despises his authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even pointed out that "there are other alternatives to escape."
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the cessation of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, once again demanded that the criminal proceedings be lifted.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate being harassed by every resurgence of the Affaire Polanski and added, "No one in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Thirty-two years is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September at the instigation of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed down by the rise of the dollar and closes without price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed without price on Friday in a market torn between better indicators than the US and an increase in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures available at closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has given 0.55 points to 2190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"To be honest, the market is quite quiet," Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management noted.
"It remains very limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will continue until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than envisaged, which "have contributed to improving the market view to the solidity of the recovery of the economy", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the USA, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and much more than planned.
Furthermore, American consumer confidence improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan index preview.
However, the indexes have been slowed down by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has been at its highest level against the euro for two months, pushing ''the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation down'," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
The 10-year yield on the Treasury bond increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening, compared with 3.482% on the 30-year bond to 4.497%, compared with 4.492% on the previous day.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of round trip through South Africa, the 112 candidates to the title of Miss World will cross the last hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch a billion television viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in a row in the Johannesburg area, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were selected Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a real vortex of pleasure.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, were simply extraordinary.
I've seen a lot of things and had a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 5 p.m. to 3 p.m. of Central European Time.
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, underscored Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchange of experiences with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, encounters with the press and safari, the Miss now focus on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, and emulate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
It is, of course, the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, throws Miss India in with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defil in traditional costumes and not to forget in a bathing suit.
The performance is presented by a television presenter, the Chinese woman Angela Chow, the ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and Steve Douglas, who is responsible for the Miss World Committee.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to receive the world with an unsurpassable warmth and pride, assures Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visited the famous township in Soweto, but this time they tasted it by bike and local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not usual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Her most beautiful memory, however, is undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to promote this event a little more.
I'm wrong with people I could probably never approach.
I'm sure I'll come back to the 2010 World Cup, promised with enthusiasm Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
According to his son David, the news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in hospital there for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he got off the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m. CET) from Paris.
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured him that he would go "fastest" to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following surgery on a herniated disc on November 26th.
The singer was "translated into an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma by the doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted to Paris on Monday for a follow-up bacterial infection following a herniated disc surgery on 26 November.
The singer had to undergo surgery again on the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia took part in a school event at the French High School in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer from the AFP noted.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has severely burdened neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer on 26 November in the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had committed the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely indignant, Mr. Camus explained.
I've heard of the possibility of a trial being initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "traveled far too fast with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles."
I spoke personally to this doctor, who assured me that he regarded this trip as completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I already had two intervertebral disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant , a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practised at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times due to failed operations and not forgetting, due to tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Association, described him as "a man without scruples", who is "regularly" answerable to the board of directors and is "everything else than recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention had been "perfect" and that post-operative investigations had been "normal".
Operation "does not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have been running since this summer, seems to be in question.
It is clear that it is a bit too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), explained Mr Camus.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) is becoming energetic and calls on the party Nouveau Centre to stop using its seal
On Friday, the Alliance of the Parties, under the supervision of François Bayrou's MoDem Party, reacted fiercely to an attempt to take over the Seal, which was once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the part of the President of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and asked him, under threat of legal prosecution, not to use the Seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political heritage after giving his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
He had received the support of MEP Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now with NC), who claimed the ownership of the UDF brand because he was the first to apply for it at the Institut national de la proprieté industrielle in 2004.
However, the office of UDF, a party alliance supervised by François Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they could not be expropriated and, under threat of legal prosecution, set a deadline for the Minister and the MP to stop using this seal and transfer the trademark's property rights to it.
In recent days, you have made numerous statements suggesting to your political movement that you take over the UDF seal ++, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + today's UDF +, printed on your political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, explained the UDF office and called on the NC party "to immediately remove the mention of the name UDF from all material and from (their) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the trademark's property rights to its legal claimants".
If you refuse to do so, we will sue you to ensure respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF" has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978, recalling that Morin and his friends "have made the choice" to leave it in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had done in 2002 to form the UMP party.
Thus, according to the signatory, the Nouveau centre party has no right to use the UDF (Union pour la démocratie française) seal.
They also recall that the last Congress of the UDF in 2007 passed the three-year membership of the MoDem party and the establishment of a office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues: "At the time when he applied for the brand name, he had not been a member of the UDF for three years, but of the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the absence of the deposit of the acronym UDF to perform this for himself.
You also point out that this recklessness is in the best way to turn into a crime, and ironic the NC's strategy: "It seems to us in politics as well as in life more dignified to make a name for oneself, rather than trying to get out of anonymity, by fraudulently acquiring a name to which you have no legal claim".
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier condemned for exploitation of weakness
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to sneak up on some of her assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will have to answer for the exploitation of weakness in court on 15 and 16 April 2010, a crime punishable by a maximum imprisonment of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair that is worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are torn apart and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal in their hands.
Likewise, however, the 15th Trial Chamber ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is conducted jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to submit to such an investigation, especially not under the conditions presented during the investigation by the prosecutor's office of Nanterre.
The doctors appointed on Friday should submit a report before 10 March 2010, in which you clearly state whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to go through these tests.
I will talk to her, explained the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the Court of First Instance.
This is an excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, who must be protected, he affirmed.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has launched a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of having exploited her mother's weakness for years in order to steal a total of €1 billion in bank cheques, insurance policies, or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always refuted being manipulated by the photographer, whom she regards as a long-time friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' plaidoyers led to a large family debacle on Friday.
Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer has appealed to three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she distrusts Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added, "Please explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
I have never been able to speak to Françoise since her marriage".
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office is of the opinion that the applicant had no right to react in this way, especially because in recent days a guardian's judge has refused to file a request for legal protection against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place," said Marie-Christine Daubigney, the prosecutor's representative.
The Court of First Instance has now decided to give a judgment after the proceedings on the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers have taken place.
Manager Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of management of large companies in terms of its employees, said the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: It is intended for staff to join "values" determined the best, as it used to be on consumer products designed by technicians in the factory to impose.
By placing the customer at the center of the business, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose preferences of customers again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all of the company's intellectual functions, especially those of R&D and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE ( Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) demands "from all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking view"; it demands from the employees a commitment that the instructions of authoritarian management completely contradict.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution that would consist of placing the employees at the centre of the company's concerns on an equal footing with the customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire that Orange submitted to his wage earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to see that in the face of a new situation, after many detours, the whole structure finally comes to do what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most executives have a much simplified idea of human behavior.
Their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic, originating from the major engineering schools.
Through intellectual comfort, they adopt the old behaviorist theory, which was recently reactivated by the American "neurosciences" and unknowingly widely disseminated by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "sic" to engage employees, a recent Le Figaro.fr survey by Ipsos strengthens the managers in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identifying and measuring the mobilisation factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for wage earners, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of realizing part of their dreams, ambition and intentions.
At the moment only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a given doxa, which allows them to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, corporate managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their human resource management in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is favourable to the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The Oslo speech: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
On Friday, the American Right welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo the night before, and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who mocked the award to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the President's speech, following the example of the former Vice President candidate in the 2008 elections, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, explained Palin, the face of the Republican Party's right wing in the U.S. Today newspaper, and added that she herself had raised the issue of a "sometimes necessary" war in her very recent memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force; a way to declare his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, argued that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I thought that the speech was really very good, ex-president of the House of Representatives, who particularly acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, I felt this speech to be entirely historical, explained Ginrich, who was interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, who is seen by some as a possible candidate for the 2012 Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said that he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left" reminding the members of the Nobel Committee that they "are not free and could not hand over a prize for peace if the use of violence did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has given "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a "cosmopolitan," as "he always does," he "spoke like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live like a security bubble that they didn't create themselves and that they don't do much to protect them," says Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a hawk of the Bush era, described the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "boring, upbeat and inspirationless."
To the left of the President, democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the military response.
If the war is packed under the guise of justice, the massacre of the innocent can easily be justified, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, continues to praise the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama prematurely, described the speech itself as a "monumental work" for a speaker such as him, who is known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "offers a schedule to manage international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California daily said with enthusiasm.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time."
Truckers: Three marathons for an agreement to secure supplies for Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the unions of the street association and the TLF - the only employer organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening that put an end to the strike order and the impending severe supply shortage for Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State responsible for transport Dominique Bussereau "welcomed" the agreement which was initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators separated early Friday morning in the hope that the agreement would be signed quickly in the late morning.
Even though the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting upsetly.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. to the conclusion of the agreement, and the agreement was not signed until 18:00 p.m.
The conflict "would have done a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year", said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not much, but we start small first," says Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now instructed not to block the supply centres anymore.
"However, there will probably always be some unruly people who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF Chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke about "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and for the maintenance of the total budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable the 13th monthly salary issue and the modernisation of collective agreements to be addressed.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of taxes on employers amounting to EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the 2009 bill on corrected finances, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government demands "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated to the organisation and then to the entire profession in the event of extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", Bussereau assures.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the proceedings.
The association FNTR denounced a "deceiving trade" because the 100 million euros "were already promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but rather to avoid the goose eaters being upset on the approaching Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre association, the agreement threatens "to dig a big grave for the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disturbances this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of RATP
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest express rail network in France for the greater Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between the unions and the head of the RATP (Independent Pariser Personentransportverwaltung) keeps strikers waiting with their demands for wage increases.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas no trains ran between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central line only one of four trains was ready for use.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced passengers to change trains.
The department store chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is trying to connect the big businesses by transport".
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The RATP section connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains operated on schedule during peak hours, and almost none during low - traffic times.
As on Thursday, there was no human feeling on the platforms, as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, especially because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), said that he would have gotten up "one and a half hours earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to take care of passengers by staff and regulatory staff, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed via Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the strikers' general meetings again took place, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the leaders on Friday afternoon.
The RER managing director proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career paths, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-due wage supplement.
The CGT was outraged by the fact that RATP itself is placing its wage compensation proposals in parentheses, stressing that the leadership "is not able to solve a problem, whereas this was also possible for the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
RATP made it clear that a new meeting on "comprehensive examination of working conditions" was scheduled for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the branch of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leader who so far refused any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line after an announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage supplement of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). Furthermore, they complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers travel every day.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a wage supplement of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish main party of the country; a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government enormously difficult, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "site for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", said the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the resolution to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the dissolution. Moreover, he pointed out that 37 of the party’s leaders, including Chairman Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political activity for a period of five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the waiver of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the Party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in parliament (of 550).
Before the verdict, the party leaders stated that parliamentarians would rather leave the parliament than meet like non-party parliamentarians.
The decision was followed by a case initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many other countries regard as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court intersperses the government, which seeks to meet the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, in order to let the support of the PKK by the Kurds run out and put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a resolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in South East Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan's prison conditions had led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP's premises in the megacity of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is mainly populated by Kurds.
The police used tear gas grenades and water cannons when the demonstrators started throwing Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court's decision "will deepen despair even further".
"Turkey cannot resolve this (Kurdish, editor's note) question on the basis of a party's ban," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose the closing of the parties on principle.
This does not solve the problems," said energy minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"One can obviously expect a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK confessed to an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the FES winter service manager.
But so that his employees can try out and master the entire vehicle technology.
It could be the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES will proceed according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows everywhere in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes are driven off with large scatter vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include main roads and thoroughfares such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire service accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with gradients, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
If necessary, the approximately 1040 kilometres would have to be sprinkled in a maximum of three hours with wet salt that adheres better.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning, "so that the routes are free until the traffic starts".
It will be difficult if it does not snow until 7.30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is ready to make room for the stray vehicles".
Only after that, if it does not snow any further, will it be your turn to take access roads and access roads, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side roads and side roads.
There will be complaints there, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES's footmen set off, danger points and transitions are cleared primarily.
The FES can usually not take care of all bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which mainly keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
Since there is a quick smoothness on this, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the spreader is on its way.
If necessary, this is also called by the police.
The cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-large animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reporting Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived some 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent of Pangaea at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationship, the propagation and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Triassic, team member Randall Irmis reports from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
The researchers quickly identified some of the bones as a new species.
In the course of the excavation, they collected the remains of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino's early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only single fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This discovery is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current doctrine, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these primal dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts discuss when the lizards split into their three most important developmental lines: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the velociraptor and the birds, the four-legged sauropods and their relatives known as "long necks", and the plants-eating ornithischia (bird-basin saurians), which included the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus, for example.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found clues to airbags, such as the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the giant sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight bones, the common ancestor of both groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
According to this, the three lines of development separated early on and spread from South America over all parts of the world, which at that time formed a single land mass as a supercontinent of Pangaea.
This is supported by the fact that the team together with Tawa hallae found the remains of two other, not very closely related theropods.
The researchers argue that the three cannot be descended from a common immigrant ancestor.
We believe there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be distorted, because in South America many primitive dinosaur fossils have simply been preserved, while on other continents hardly anything can be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile stem to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the middle ages is still mysterious.
During the Triassic period, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flight dinosaurs, and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while the relationship died out at the border from the Triassic to the Jura.
Success story didn't last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs happened to survive, but not the other reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact caused a group of animals to bloom, which had also developed in the Triassic, and since then a shadow existence has extended: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors of the University of Toronto are on it, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are present, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police eviction of the occupied casino of Frankfurt Goethe University is making waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, but also from universities all over Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand out with the protesting students on Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police operation initiated by the Presidium.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike cleared last week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The property damages, the signatories state, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police commando".
The eviction was an "inacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served "the denigitimation and criminalization of the protest" and distracted from the content.
The Bureau had withdrawn from the necessary discourse.
The lecturers call for the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the property damage, it is said.
Protest Legitimized
The youth of the Verdi union and the German Trade Union Confederation are also solidarising with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen's science minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbadener Landtag.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand vandalism, said Peter Beuth, member of the CDU's state parliament.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Left saw this differently.
The CDU uses painted walls as an excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they had been cleared.
The left has tabled a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a strictly guarded location for secret military research.
Today, the commune with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had established contacts with the Frankfurt science location Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Vice-Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed planning director Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific research focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to secure orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the major corporations Sitronics and Rosssiyskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for armament research.
Selenograd (literally "Green City") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
Quite so. S21 is much more than the laying down of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of Baden-Württemberg's capital for a decade into hopeless construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 originated from the spirit of the 1980s.
Head railway stations with tracks that end in the middle of the city were considered to be 19th century transport-technical fossils, which looked like brake blocks of a modern rail transport, since it once took a lot of time to span locomotives from rear to front.
Drive in, hold for a moment, keep driving - that's how it should go.
And that is why the head stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which lies halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava on the trans-European rail-magistral - therefore the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian big city it is almost priceless to implement the low-lying.
However, head stations no longer have any entry and exit problems since there have been modern turn-over trains with railcars and steering cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 and the new ICE line to Ulm are now being tackled.
National and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway is involved, also because the risks of the Republic's largest single infrastructure project are borne by taxpayers and not by the state corporation.
The project can still be reasonably justified in terms of urban planning.
New urban space is created, which - one believes the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the line are intended for passenger transport, to which - typically in the 1980s - huge growth was attributed.
At that time, there was no competition from the low-cost aircraft.
However, modern transport policy must first be aimed at strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport by truck.
However, the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy gradients.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros are to be buried in Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that ten to 15 billion is realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the track has been built at slow motion speed.
It would be urgently necessary to press the tube correctly here.
But S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rhine Valley route becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbadener Landtag whether it will go against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) to the night flight ban in review.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to examine the more than 400-page VGH ruling legally, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
On that day, the VGH in Kassel had given written reasons that, in the case of the construction of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport, the country had to re-rule the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as provided for by the state government, was incompatible with the legal protection of the population against nocturnal aircraft noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether to review the verdict.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the representatives of the government to renounce a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD faction leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be regarded as a "word break".
It's fucking hard to keep your word, Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, alluding to the FDP election slogan, "We keep our word."
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's accusation that the state government is trying to arrive at its night flights with "right-wing twist and trickery".
A thorough legal examination takes time.
The coalition did not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As it represented the opposition, the statements of his group on the night flight ban had never been.
US banks pay back aid
The crisis-torn U.S. major banks are stripping off their state shackles.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America repaid the aid from the bank rescue fund Tarp in the amount of a total of 45 billion dollars (a good 30 billion euros) in one fell swoop.
And the Citigroup also plans to repay state aid, according to a report by the US broadcaster CNBC.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions associated with the acceptance of the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had raised over $19 billion of fresh money from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the sum out of her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by sales.
Bank boss Kenneth Lewis expressed his thanks to the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The injection of money had helped over a very difficult time.
At the height of the financial crisis, the money house had become entrenched with the takeover of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market for exemption from its liabilities to the state.
Already on Thursday, the US bank could announce a roughly $20 billion increase in its capital, reported CNBC, citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesman didn't want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid.
Quick choice
Then everything went faster than I thought.
Hardly two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors pushed the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the board wanted to vote on the personnel.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF Capital Studio in Berlin, was a favourite.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster - officially, in order not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role not to further damage ZDF's director Markus Schächter, should this proposal not get through to the Board of Directors either.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had failed on the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke in favour of Brender, seven voted against him. Brender’s election was a bitter defeat for shafters, but an expected one.
The Union majority in the Board of Directors had already signalled weeks before the election that Brender would not want to be confirmed in office.
The opposition had been organized against the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender, ZDF's news programmes had lost ratings, he declined another term of office for the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on ZDF was scourged.
Recently, even 35 state lawyers had intervened in the debate, which assessed Koch's actions as unconstitutional.
It didn't do any good.
The person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance studies.
He then worked at Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, initially to "heute-journal".
Followed by: personal speaker of the editor-in-chief from 1988 to 1990; correspondent in Washington from 1991/92; director and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin" until 1998; director of ZDF's foreign policy until 2001; since then head of the ZDF Capital Studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit following the election of Brender, who was still elected as Journalist of the Year by the magazine Medium Magazin on Wednesday.
Koch's opposition on the board of directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, stated last week that the Länder should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that personnel proposals by the director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also excluded an extract from the ZDF supervisory boards from party politicians.
Brender's prospective successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the board with a clever move - by strongly criticizing the board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as well as to elect the board of directors without suspecting that he would take office as a party-goer.
In party arithmetic Frey is attributed to the left-liberals anyway.
Study is getting out of shape
Partial success for the students: After a year of the educational strike, the ministers of education of the Länder finally introduced themselves on Thursday: At a meeting of ministers of culture and university rectors, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor's and Master's.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the examination load: In principle, each study module should only complete with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of students is to be checked and "a realistic and justifiable measure" is to be ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master courses more flexible.
Furthermore, there should be no derogations from the country rules.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have had the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
Now, for the first time, it has been filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of examinations in some cases drastically: "Each module usually completes with only one examination," says a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially regulate the admission of study programmes.
The "significant reduction in the workload of the examination", said the Accreditation Council Chairman Reinhold Grimm, should "stop a lack of development that significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, the "studentability" is to be "the decisive criterion" in design in the future.
Modules such as content "must be strictly checked" whether "unnecessary restrictions of students in the selection of
The European Commission's White Paper on the future of the European Union.
The students had "a claim to have room for manoeuvre, to enable and promote their own initiative".
The rules should apply to the admission of new courses, but also to the examination of existing ones.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – which means, however, that it takes until 2015 for all degree programmes to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this nationwide, which are subject to the accreditation council set up by the countries.
In October, the ministers of culture had called on the countries "with force" to influence the agencies in such a way that the amount of material is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed on appropriate measures with the state ministries.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
Of the money, the universities are primarily to set up tutor programs and strengthen student advice as well as examination and foreign offices.
The country and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce an amendment to the Higher Education Act into the parliament.
According to this, only one examination is to be required for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to make the study process more flexible, to ensure the recognition of certificates of achievement at other universities and to facilitate access to the Master's degree.
By the end of next year, all courses of study in the country are to be checked for their studyability.
The government and opposition had again argued on Thursday about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso University Groups demanded that the shaping of the education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
After the educational strikes at the latest, the students as affected should now also "speak a word".
The future academics received support from the President of the Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experience," she said at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture on Thursday with which the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
All in all, the decisions of the Education and Science Union (GEW) did not go far enough: it demands a legal claim that allows every graduate with a Bachelor's degree access to a further Master's degree course.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that sufficient Master's places with the best possible study conditions are available for today's generation of Bachelor's students tomorrow, says GEW board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to recruit significantly more lecturers.
However, the ministers of culture did not express themselves on a freer access to the master's degree.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and leaving is almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he addresses the arrival experience of a dissident who gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, Werner Söllner worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as an editor in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, held the legendary Frankfurt Poetic Lectures at Goethe University in 1993, and since 2002 he has been the director of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
He caused a considerable extra-literary stir last Tuesday during a conference in Munich, which dealt with "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror of its Securitateacts".
Söllner visibly unsettled and embarrassed read a statement in which he admitted his collaboration as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of Romanian fellow writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the participants, Söllner had received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun slowly, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "so someone who has not resisted intimidation of the Securitate enough."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize ceremony for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary examination of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is being shaken by a case that identifies the abysses and the dissension of a political system based on surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can tell from previous knowledge, not only the perpetrator, but also the victim.
In his Securitate file IM Walter had played a role, said the literary scholar Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and pointed to the positive influence of IM Walter.
He had "cut it off" in all the difficult points for him at the time, according to Markel.
It was a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not entirely surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
Those affected, one may assume, are speculated and in some cases probably also knew, which clear name hid behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and just also Walter.
Unlike in the case of the now very process-proof sighting of the Stasi files in Germany, the handling of the remains of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education has been held back and hindered.
A National Council for the Processing of the Securitate Files (CNSAS) corresponding to the Birthler Authority was founded only in 1999, but the release of the files has been rather slow since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very great was confirmed by an interview after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which a former Securitate leader from Temesvar expressed his disparaging opinion on the prize winner.
She had a psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power here meant to be able to express itself quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of Söllner, as is so often the case with hidden guilt, is linked to inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who has been harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by a desire for knowledge rather than by blame and shame.
It is more than a footnote to the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday.
Saturation Supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there was just a neatly dressed field salesman coming from a very nice Christmas party, at which a sporting goods manufacturer had distributed Goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the supplier, climbed into a summoned C-Class a quarter of an hour after midnight. ̈
The man with the striking baldness let himself be chauffeured because of the still foreign city.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - alcohol was not in the game after all, and drunk with luck the 55-year-old was no more.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work continues.
Or get started.
In the words of the Swiss only three days before: "We have achieved the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 victory against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is imminent on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the king-class performance in everyday league life in Mainz.
And to turn off the completely re-revealed weaknesses after the fast three gates by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Draw
The eighth round of the Champions League (back matches 16/17 + 23/24 February / return matches 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy over the brilliant debut of the Babbel successor thus remained restrained.
Not only with the supposed healer, who in the short time had given confidence, commitment and joy of playing to the insecure Stuttgart professionals.
I approached the players and told them to remember their strengths and encouraged them to be more courageous, soul shrink Gross explained the simple-sounding recipe for success, which had not had any effect under therapist Babbel.
He has sparked a certain magic, admits Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, thanks to his dynamism, immediately became the best player on the pitch after weeks of injury, tried to describe the established "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working methods of the new superior: "He is a man who goes through and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel it had obviously been lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns sports board member Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all consistency.
Like Gross, players and managers were careful not to overvalue the victory against the Romanian guests, who were weakened in replacement and completely overwhelmed by their defenses.
They had also won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen at the 0:4 the bad awakening came, Khedira gave to consider.
And sports board member Horst Heldt warned that although one goal of the season was achieved, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
Heldt's 40th birthday, even after the first home win in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were revived in the form of a television interview by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Held counters Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had accused the board of leadership of weak leadership and had decided to change coaches on pressure from pubescent fans.
Lehmann also considered that his day off had been cancelled after playing, as a sign of lack of sovereignty and displeasure.
Lehmann's statements are "shaped by pure egoism," Heldt wedged back and announced consequences for the final man.
I don't think they'll be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that without the preparatory work by the replaced coach team, the playful and militantly strong performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a big part in the success", said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and the man with the plastic bag agreed.
WM-Fight in heavyweight
Hitziges Duel in Bern: Time and again challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitali Klitschko provoked with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title after the WBC version.
The judge's verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains boxing champion in heavyweight.
The 38-year-old champion, according to the WBC version, defeated US-American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Before that, the Ukrainian was already twice World Champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out with the knockout that everyone expected.
Klitschko expanded his record to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, and he had to give himself up twice due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Berner Arena, Klitschko, who was 2.02 metres tall, wanted to dictate the fight primarily with his left-hand leadership.
However, the 11-centimeter smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly evaded the beatings of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights decisively to the finish.
All in all, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to make ends meet.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in the year 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve laps.
The challenger had caused some turbulence before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right".
When weighing, the champion was provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years of hiatus, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and got back his WBC belt, which he had previously had to surrender without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the USA in September.
In this fight I only got one stroke and am physically very well in shape, Klitschko had founded a quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the unification of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
But the belt of the WBA is worn by the British David Haye, after he was able to dethrone the 2.13-meter Nikolai Waluyev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight planned for September against Vitali Klitschko in the summer.
It is said that his promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembleystadion in London.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and left demand clarification from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the air raid of Kunduz, the opposition subordinated Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) to a deliberate deception.
The minister had said "knowingly the untruth" on the deadly bombardment on two tanker trains in September, said Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news programme "Tagesschau".
It's commonly called lying.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had, which Mr Guttenberg read, said Trittin.
On Friday it became known that the attack was not only about destroying the kidnapped vices, but also about killing two Taliban leaders in a targeted manner.
According to the Nato investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the US air attack requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
On Saturday, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) asked the Greens, the SPD and the Left to speak to the Bundestag immediately and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Federal Government's policy on Afghanistan - and whether the Federal Chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery did not have any influence on the actual deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been raised about the Ministry's presentation of the background to the dismissal of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information provided by the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have provided correct and complete information about the background of the tank truck attack.
Officially, they had denied the existence of the Nato reports and withheld sensitive details from the Minister.
However, the two top officials reported that they had even pointed out several reports to the Ministry of Defense, including a two-page document by commanding Colonel Klein and a fighter report.
Wichert is now said to have asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He had not received an answer so far, it is said.
The Ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the committee of inquiry of the Bundestag, which wants to be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see pictures in a awake state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
The boundaries between imagination and reality are not only blurred in the case of the mentally ill and in the drug rush.
As long as it happens in your sleep, it's all right.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we are allowed to indulge ourselves uninhibited in the wildest imaginations and imaginations.
However, those who experience dreamlike conditions in wax, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicted in the modern Western world, at least as a stranger.
But such images and voices are not only created by the mentally ill or intoxicated with drugs.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, delusion and reality blur.
Dream-like altered waking states can occur in a variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusion.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic rapture states, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal messenger substances of the brain - above all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, stated in 1861 a "great similarity of delusion with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, delusions, illusions of such."
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky-colored.
Gravity has no power over him, he's floating on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil-figures with blood-red, distorted frays, teeth-fleshing.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, knots them into a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a speaker and lays the noose around his neck.
Jump.
The noose is loosening.
That's supposed to be a lesson for you, the voices scream in a drum-splashing choir, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last one is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness. He's been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and the deepest despair, he says.
The illusions are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric hospitals it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds; they get into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of size, relationship or persecution.
Voice listening is particularly common - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to separate important things from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies that originate from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the centre of the action, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time he gets into a passive role, he is overwhelmed by the events, like in a dream, and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A comparison of reality is usually not possible for them, the illusions are cruel reality, waking up excluded.
To have experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, is basically preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are rooted in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain beats capriols still puzzles researchers.
Exceptional states can cause any human being to lose the reference to reality for a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that minimal brain damage is present in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery, how the disorder of the neural system comes about, which at first did not manifest itself over many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brains are hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get them, says the Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether false images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a question of the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and delusions for ten years, and last year he evaluated his findings in the book "The Irreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations belong to the typical side effects of psychosis, but also to surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease and cranial brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
According to Kasten, hallucinations are composed of memory contents that are usually held back.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain is hot, or even when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can cause this state just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But it's also irritation, stress, heartache or other mental states of exception.
In recent studies, up to a third of those surveyed reported having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the Gymnasium there.
A normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the pictures and the voices.
During the break it may happen that a limp boy with long, dark hair speaks to it.
When it answers it, the classmates look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this boy and the other delusions are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are usually scary
Often the illusions are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher is introducing a new classmate in her eyes and ears, while he is explaining mathematical equations for everyone else in a visible and audible way on the board.
At night, the apparitions are usually scary.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which is far too rare and far too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the scratches or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, are created in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she yells at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell her that they think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed her Abitur last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she made contact with the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Insanity is also a work of art out of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from irritation deprivation, he is highly likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I'm guessing the brain will be understaffed and self-care for his entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls Papa has not been her biological father ever since she could think.
Since the same areas of the brain are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected, such as Sarah K., to distinguish between false images and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is taking place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, so they seem so real."
Also nocturnal dream images evaluate box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenia, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their delusions as unreal.
Caste therefore advises his patients to appreciate hallucinations as a special ability.
Boundary state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, imaginary experiences are mostly pathologized in our too conscious world, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief Physician of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful illness, but it also contains positive, creative - delusion is also a work of art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of dream-like altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that the experiencer considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state in retrospect.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to cope with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is visualized in the imagination.
An intensive form of sense foundation and meaning in an intrinsically unbearable situation, which enables us humans to not perish in a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, while his body is doomed to motionlessness in the intensive care unit.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among noblemen who make drugs from blood.
When carried by a Greek on a motorcycle to his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes up completely in the imagined happening, everything is real, even later in the memory.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental journeys are still overly clear to me after years and in minor details.
More clearly and more intensely than what has really been experienced.
The intensity of this experience transcends the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations, and drug intoxication show just how fragile our inner images of external reality are in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist's box, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publisher Kallen is an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children in the long term, he told the SPIEGEL.
In the future, the holding company will continue to belong to 100 percent of the family.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to join the company, the 69-year-old told the SPIEGEL.
We have made provision for the details of this.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only after that.
Also the question of whether they are able to do so.
You can't put 7500 employees in front of your children if they're not qualified enough.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he would withdraw from the board chair from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, responsibility for the company's assets was added to the treasury and, after Jürgen Todenhöfer left, to direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also served to bridge "10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding should continue to be 100 percent of the family, Burda said.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe before the demise: "This always concerned families who were infected by a greed for capital, who have completely speculated and thought that they could rise to become a very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had "never dreamed of world power," says Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play in the World League with 'Time' either, these stores have become too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least that's what El Corte Inglés has planned, who recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), where everything revolves around personal hygiene.
In the wellness area, located on the 8th floor, you will find among other prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide a depilation with laser; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while enjoying a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to set up your own beauty party with eight girlfriends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many options Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2 divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this kind of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session with the input of a personal password on a touch screen, which is opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to do your workouts correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching exercises) are sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if, after training your body, you want to stop by the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi company has a room where treatments to regain the beauty, shine and health of your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10.00 a.m. to 10.00 p.m. in the evening 365 days a year.
The most diverse décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and so it is again a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their festive dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the cleavage, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that has to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated cleavage. You can only advise against that.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa together with the city of Barcelona created the "LIVE office".
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The LIVE office (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility through management, coordination, subsidisation, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarize the opinions and measures of the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among others, those related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa is taking part in the promotion of electric cars.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesies the Spanish automobile industry, which is the largest exporter of the country, "a horizon of calm".
At the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the government president, Zapatero recalled the measures the government has taken to support the automotive sector in the course of the government year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, today we would have a panorama of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the growth of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided EUR 800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn generated investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government's measures to stimulate demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, which are applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows the emission of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which rose "by 40 percent" in November.
On 20,000 quadrametres of classic vehicles

Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a specially equipped race track in the outdoor area of the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmental Sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sport is compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start-up system of the engine, christened i-Stop, in the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 stands out for its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and a good hold.
The steering wheel is also excellent.
Looking further at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, you can see that Mazda is on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the spectacular colors red and blue.
This style partly reminds us of the style of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, it can be said without further ado that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort, so that four adults can travel comfortably by car.
To all this comes a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start-up system is only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed transmission.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out for its fineness, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who don't drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with gasoline engine because of its great comfort in gear shifting and its low consumption, even though Mazda's diesel models are the most sold.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
From the standard equipment stands out above all the assistant for the lane change (RVM), which thus eliminates the blind angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive inner mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth as well as the chrome-plated 17-inch rims.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: besides other elements, especially the learnable Bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, because of its handling and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometres a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21.770 Euro for the model Luxury and 23,270 Euro for the test-driven model Sportive.
In return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day the highest driving pleasure.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look just as elegant as sexy, beamed more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your e-mails without a possibility to see certain attachments or to surf the Internet.
It has enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the road is rather unlikely, but the idea itself is of interest to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example only half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the company's success, it has launched two new devices: one intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free data service, quite unlike the Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but has a surprise at hand.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world on a smartphone already know what it means to have to give up all the data in order to be able to read their emails, once you have crossed the country border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and a good pair of glasses to read all the fine print.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails, and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have a Wifi/WLAN) can offer these kinds of tariffs means that telephone providers have to think slowly but safely and start considering different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, and its prices include downloading books and further inquiries on the Internet.
No tarragon and no hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, namely when you buy it, and not month after month.
And that's exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a purchase opportunity with lifelong internet access as the Peek already offers in the USA.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is without a doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
When Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him at his, no doubt, second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric-, and she wore some large embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress at more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses are very different in the type of fabric they are made of.
At the inauguration, she wore a lace dress and a patterned velvet in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-high heels and the second time a regular model, but gold colors.
The hairstyle was also different every time: The hair was stuck up as a hair wreath on this occasion, the previous one she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the conclusion of the study carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women "Fruitability and Career of Women in Spain".
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities on the labour market restricted by their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are large differences in the decision to start a family and in the number of children, depending on whether women work or not, and if so, what kind of profession they pursue.
Those of them who do not do any other work outside the house, work only part-time or do not have a fixed employment contract are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with fixed employment, especially in the public sector, postpone the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"Women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with a permanent job are given their first child on average only 3.7 years after moving in, a figure which increases to 4.1 years for women with a permanent job, who have taken longer to achieve this and who have moved in and realized the first child much later.
In addition, the type of work has a great influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar regarding the readiness to conceive," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference was also noted among women of the same age.
For example, women in the 35-49 age group, depending on whether they only have a secondary education or a higher education, became mothers for the first time, on average, at 25,1 or 32,1 respectively.
There is also another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women who have completed their main degree are already getting married and having their first child before their first permanent position, the women with a middle or high school degree are doing it exactly the other way around and are first looking for a permanent position and getting married after it and then having their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The leading actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will become another famous figurehead as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (" Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (colleague of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
They had all appeared on this occasion.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, pictures by Fernando Vicente) to the three x-rays of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear-influenced genre (short biography, life and work), but searches for an attachment to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent saves neither terror nor enlightenment.
In addition to the fact that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When reading his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the disastrous fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any god".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between fainting and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was captivated by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted of coming to heaven on the detour of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 peaks in the world literature, you have to climb up the north wall, on the wall where the best climbers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny bitch.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a county landowner, and other times he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the mad cry that was screamed out of a bridge by that personality from Munich, so that his echo echoed his literary way until the night of the 20th century. He did this on a journey on which he fled from himself and begged posterity with a speech full of violence before the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and begged: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I may finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spencer are engraved: ' the sleep after the effort,/ after the storm of the harbor,/ the rest after the war,/ after a full life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband accepted it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying on her between the azaleas or the birds sang in Greek.
Not a single other case is known where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was much greater than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to infuse Joyce in Baroja?
What, then, did Benet intend if he did not bring Baroja up to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, besides destroying that man's fame, so that he could put himself on this pedestal?"
Fig Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 were running next to her and our dog, our dog is a hybrid that we took from the shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue they kicked him two and hurt him severely.
Our indignation cannot be put into words, because it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun is supposed to be with a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course carried out on a leash.
Add to that the suffocation that a woman who walked comfortably, when she tried to reprove these people due to the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he might also do the same with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o’clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog cried all day long.
Of course, we have filed a complaint at a nearby police station, but we have serious doubts as to whether this will do anything at all and in order to prevent possible prejudices from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our indignation at what has happened has led us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must be done in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, an animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of her commitment to road safety, which "includes much more than just designing and producing products that are becoming safer and safer every day", and further reiterated that it also contributes to bringing this goal one step closer every day with other actions of educational and informative character.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to more than 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely for the reason that, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, they are always committed to one of their main objectives being the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks is increasing again
After almost two years, the car market for vans finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in terms of 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first ever increase after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Anfac Manufacturers' Association and the Ganvam Car Dealers' Association.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution, since the reference data used for comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly bad year of chewing, with a decrease of 60% in the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the previous month, the total registrations for these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures for the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this figure includes all vehicles which constitute the small van market: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, small vans, small vans and lighter small trucks/frames.
Furthermore, the same storm clouds are still in the sky, which affect demand the most, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, most of the sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100 % of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
For example, to these restrictions, which are the result of the bank's overturned money, we have to include other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continuation of the poor economic situation.
With this panorama, and unlike passenger cars, financial support has not helped much in the purchase of a car in Plan 2000E.
However, this plan is not only for private individuals, but also for the self-employed and small companies, if they want to buy a small van up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission that must not exceed 160 grams per kilometer driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reminded us that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The association of car dealers predicts for 2010 a similar year as the one just past, for which it expects a sales loss (in the case of passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case at the time with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as is currently the case with the ESP stability control system, the auxiliary systems for braking in emergencies must become mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, and a waiting period has been set for the remaining vehicles until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure adopted by the European Union is to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many rear-end collisions due to their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assist is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking manoeuvre, which detects the system based on the brake strength applied by the driver to the brake pedal.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident did not even step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system, thereby reducing the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented every year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistance.
There would be even fewer accidents - it is expected that one in four accidents could be prevented by personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, the system will help him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is inevitable, the brake assister exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to minimise the damage.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were already informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europa, wants to ensure that the affected party gives its consent to each individual point of the plan in advance.
And that is why it may be that the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will take a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports car, which has support from the Russian group Converg, is gaining more and more popularity.
In the absence of any such buyer, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and really managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, with which he now only weighs 1,275 kilos.
In order to create something like this, they first dispensed with the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent screen roof with manual drive, thus saving 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model such as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by removing the air conditioning again 13; in addition, the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 liters, thus saving another 7 kilos; by installing sporty Bacquet seats again 12 and with the light 19-inch rims again five saved.
Then one had reached the missing kilo again by the omission of the audio system CDR-30 again six kilos less and by the exchange of the door handles by handles made of fabric the missing kilo.
Although it is also available with the PDK dual coupling transmission, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with 6-speed manual transmission, mainly on the smaller roads of California, on mountain routes that were really very curvy.
With his driving behavior one can give him only the grade perfectly.
However, the reduction of his weight has not led to him being less secure on the road.
It's rather the opposite: for a long time we haven't tested such a small and light model, but at the same time it also gives you a feeling of great confidence in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low pace in the required time, until we give him the orders to race, slow down, recover and then get everything out of his engine again ...
He does everything he is told, the car does everything we tell him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his steering system, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 HP (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and you can increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time at the Panamera.
Acceleration is unimaginably brutal, whether from standing up or when accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the road on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the potholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole track; and that although we found ice at dawn and roll split in the morning on some of these curves.
In summary, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pleasure, as it is usually rare and there is much more in it than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will enter the market in February 2010 and cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bosom friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same stubbornness as her bags of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many unusual players in the Dusko Ivanovic team, celebrated an outstanding triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra and thus comes first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight triples (29 in the rating).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the major failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mikov with a large amount of effort and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 scored triples contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the blue reds, who from the beginning sat to the top on the display board.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, one could already guess that they had come to the field with well-warmed wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the team from Álava chose an in-side game of Barac and the game of Eliyahu, who was greeted with whistles and applause on his return to the team, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to be the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" score of Splitter has already indicated that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was far from being decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that not everyone wins on their playing field, and thanks to the constantly attacking "Hand of Elías" they came back to the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the "yellow" turning the rudder (50-49).
More Disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured, but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with accuracy in order to get air again and with one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that on the display board again calming distance from (54-67) was displayed, which the host could embellish with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
The Alavesen were just placed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had honestly earned in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team strength again by three points off the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and even though Splitter was out of place due to fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well and even though the Israelis were catching up at the last minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injury prevented Unicaja from facing up
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in Group B of the Euroliga to him, and this was marked by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the indoor game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The team from Malaga was not afraid of the mood in the Hall of Peace and Friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their presented game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja's appearance, even though the local team, with an indoor match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, managed to show the display board in their favour in the 13th minute 22-20, the minute when, due to an action, there was almost a fight between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to warm up and its superiority on both sides of the game, while the departure of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and Carlos Jiménez's three self-caused mistakes left a clear mark on the Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner court and the Lithuanian leader Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the Olympiacos team, which, despite its 19 losses, was superior and even managed to compensate for the difference in the game played in Malaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn made the lead within the group waver.
Unicaja tried to overcome the many failures and the resignation of Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, some hope came back to 66-57 in the 31st minute thanks to Cook's leadership and the triples and Lewis' use.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, because the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, could not be braked.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to give himself up and had to give up the lead to Olympus.
How much should you earn from your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, learn their salary, which they should earn due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of the users on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users can use a form on Facebook to enter their profession, work experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found out that on average the Spanish employee feels "poorly paid", explains the person responsible for the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer gets an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, unlike the 24,000 euros a Spaniard earns.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President removed from office must leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010 at the latest if his mandate expires officially
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that before that date he must have left the embassy where he had found asylum since September 21st.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27 because his mandate expires that day and he has to find a new place to stay."
The station also quoted the ex-president who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the scheduled date: "My point of view is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo won) Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
This failed, however, due to Zelaya's refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician, which the "de facto" government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the most tempting days since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment in which brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly allow the liquidity to be freed up at interest rates around zero, so that the banks could buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have almost ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are beginning to spread some sand, as BCE näc has already pretended with its annual auction, which will take place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are increasing again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to nationalize private risks and public debt rose again.
The focus is now on quality, and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred haven for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between eurozone countries in terms of Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability until now, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision downwards regarding the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of moral risk, who had once again tried to raise awareness among the leaders of world economic policy about what they had caused, as they had slowed down the devastating effects that the limitation of credits led to the loss of jobs when they were supposed to have decided a new day for the thank-you campaign.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates, and the development in Greece was also anticipated earlier.
A government that hides the public debt, elections, and a new government that pulls on the same strand.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a euro member country to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into the obligation to take on board the need for extra-ordinary measures to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some debauchery on too high amounts, that would now be within the expected amount.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
If, however, European differences were to diminish and Spanish were to increase further, this would be a special Spanish risk.
That of Standard & Poor’s is a farce. While the local preferred indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long life, despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment there is a call for "care while driving".
Linked branches
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear before Parliament's subcommittee yesterday, where the Spanish energy strategy will be debated over the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion by 2030 from that date, subject to the condition that the current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not amount to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should no longer invest in increasing energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international networks.
As of 2020, the question will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with carbon capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the condition of course by other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the proposal for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has called for, did not want to say anything against this law, such as creating incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, one clearly sets in this direction, despite some "individual" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, should already be taken, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, Swiss port, is the preferred partner of the Irish Flugesellschaft Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet been announced, is set at five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol of cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to study energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first highway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself as a construction company and highway operator in the country.
The City Council wants the construction completed by the end of 2014.
After the administration opted for a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and toll booth administration.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with three consortia competing in the final phase, mainly from European construction companies.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second is based in Italy, one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
Acciona's team is opposed by the Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure and the French Bouygues assembly.
The third and last consortium, which is in the short term, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction and privatisation, but it has a hurdle to overcome, as it is only through the purchase of a local construction company that you can gain access.
A strategy followed by the above-mentioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish building giants.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona focuses on this geographical area of utmost importance for the sector in which it is already well known for its activities as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
It is now its intention to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll road, which will be operated by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (north feeder), is intended to connect the western motorway in Toowong with the Kelvin Grove bypass road (see map) over a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels, which is the largest measure of congestion reduction on Brisbane roads.
The timetable issued by the city administration foresees the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll road is to open up to traffic in the last months of 2014, construction work is expected to continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government is contributing 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to the financing.
Brisbane is already a big business for Hochtief.
Australia continues to award significant contracts to Hochtief, which yesterday signed a contract with the government amounting to 154 million.
The ACS sub-company, through its local subsidiary Leighton, will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fibre optic cables.
This improvement will create fast internet access for 400,000 people and will keep the German company busy for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in Brisbane, Australia. Construction work has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
Initial investments amount to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its subsidiary Alpine, FCC has acquired the sum of EUR 64.5 million for the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometres in length for a motorway in Slovenia.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had been awarded the contract for the construction of the extension of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnelling.
The start of construction is planned for early 2010 and its implementation will last for over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising budget from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore over a sum of about three million euros annually, the railway company informed.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that presented sch to this competition announced by Renfe, 4 of which came into the final round, among them TBWA, who was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalty over 63 million for France Télécom because of the downside of the competition.
The French Competition Authority has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for its anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition on fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers in the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 due to the obstruction of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased, as the competition authority believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore relapsed.
Application trade
On the other hand, the French company’s subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading site on the Internet to increase revenues from non-telephone transactions.
In principle, this Orange application website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
It is necessary to wait until 2010 for this Siete to be available to other countries, such as Spain.
The match in the Champions League has earned Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the beginning.
The Champions League has become a source of income for football clubs since its creation in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since then, which gives them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that made the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings fame with it. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5.362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish teams) participating in this event since it was founded in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is in third place in Europe, which has earned the most money through its participation, and the only one who has won the trophy three times next to the AC Milan.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the former 1992 European Cup takes fifth place.
The list lists Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also earned the most money by participating in the past Champoins League.
Even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place among the countries that were able to match money through the Champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, as opposed to four bie Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure used by UEFA.
This financial year, the organization, which is chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenues of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualifying preliminary round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who won participation received 3.8 million for their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team). Clubs that have come to the eighth-finals receive three million each; the four that have come to the quarter-finals receive 3.3 million each.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the second, who receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and at most 31.2 million fixed income.
Barça, in turn, earned 2.5 million with his victory in the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are foreseen.
This money is allocated proportionally to the value of each television market.
The Spanish belongs to the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year's champion receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third placed and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part is distributed according to the number of games they play in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group leaked details of the offer to buy shares yesterday, with which it intends to acquire a cap of 25 to 29,9 % of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers €1.5025 per share, which is paid out for ten years and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this postponement.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at EUR 1.85, so Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Group from Jeréz shall give shareholders a period of 15 days to communicate their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the Authority.
On completion, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to remain on the brink of possible offers and the judicial squabbles of his ex-managers, the Jesús and Jaime Salazar brothers announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit.
A decision with which she becomes the first woman to hold a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created post directly under the chairmanship of the group.
This is anything but free of polemics because the company is involved in a court battle for the suspicion of diversion of more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will postpone further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the Salazar loan, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their purpose.
CNMV approves the public tender for exclusion of Paternina submitted by investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public invitation to tender submitted by investment company Mer for Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been shown that the conditions complied with the legally binding laws and that the content of the explanatory note submitted could therefore be considered "sufficient" following the amendments made last 2 December.
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,0008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of 7.65 euros per share, which in turn represents 8.95 % of the share capital consisting of 6,142,786 euros in shares admitted to the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, it was also announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the closing of the tender and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the law.
New vehicle review programmes
In these days of storms and accidents not only the car workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed to the workshops, where an expert assesses the damage and the cost of the repair.
Not a single accident is the same and the calculation of the costs of parts and working hours can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer science tools, it is a matter of minutes
That's why almost 100% of the reviewers use this type of system.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from manufacturers in order to process them afterwards and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all expert opinions are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing with in the tool market for review and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, to the point that more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched in the last five years than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes onto the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a laborious task, because every single one of the thousands of vehicle parts has to be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphic image is created of each model, on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure is proceeding quickly.
If this is a less common car, it may take up to three or four months. Currently, 99.2% of cars sold in Spain have full information about Audatex.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle park on the roads, it is over 99%.
In order to carry out the documentation work and to produce databases, Audatex has eight centres worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in various ways, thus offering different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or for the calculation of the fair value or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about a guide who about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex offers this offer not in Spain, but in the United States.
When reviewing the products that Audatex offers, it is easy to get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, the star of which is AudaPlus, a standard solution for assessing accidents for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid for according to the purpose, i.e. for each expert opinion.
It will be most expensive for customers who use it rarely, at most ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, any insurance company that makes thousands of expert reports negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly line, solely on the basis of the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is an open service on the Internet for the specialist market, with which one can offer for vehicles that have been declared as total damage.
Your statistics service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses, or for obtaining information on variations by brand and model.
For example, it can be used to examine how many models of a particular brand of car had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
Among others, it distributes Gt Estimate, which is also intended for evaluators and provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer in the same way.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT expert opinion guide is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20 % annually over the last three years and in 2008 sales amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they also started to enter the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is carried out in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, including 3,000 in Spain.
Total sales in the world of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amounted to 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2 % more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Auctioning of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a flat-fom on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value added, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, reviewers, car rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and car dealers, who have to register before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website now has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day, 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been deregistered may no longer drive on the roads, but certain parts which are not damaged may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars with historical value may be registered again, even if they have been cancelled after difficult administrative procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: Identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The ease of use of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince the older professionals, who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of working hours, surcharges or discounts, and then print out the cost estimate and pass it on to his customer.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for peer review like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
Currently, the company Audatex is working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that automechanics have been waiting for for a long time, since, for example, you can use it to select a door and then turn the picture completely around to look at the inside.
