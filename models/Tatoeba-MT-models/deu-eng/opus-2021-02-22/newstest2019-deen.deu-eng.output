DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that you get into conversation with him once, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as stated in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmower" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite the months-long debate over the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92 times national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil would have continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed up to a certain point that this would be the case," said Grindel.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and had also justified it by the fact that Grindel did not defend him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "one leaves a team or changes a club, that one talks about it with his coach and I find it a pity that this conversation has not come about so far".
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burnt
At 2:13 p.m., the Linz fire brigade was alerted to a fire on the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was delayed.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically completely and fire debris had to be removed to the extent absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery plugged into the store for lunch.
That might be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the range of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the street
What has led Lindsay Lohan to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself streamed live as she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family who wants her to be a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She accuses the adult child trafficking.
She doesn't provide any evidence for all of this in that clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan says in the video, following the family further down the street.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she's turning around and giving Lohan a slap in the face.
With tears, the actress asserts how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is supposed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign tickers: Number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and the subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 people were killed.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet entered the devastated and cut off areas of the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Chief
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused trouble in the stock markets at the beginning of August, when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletro automaker.
The U.S. stock exchange authorities sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain CEO.
British Conservative Party Congress
Sharply guarded - the Congress of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress will focus on foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference will be overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Secretary of State Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name doublings for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on it this Sunday - whether it is okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("Der nicht") - meant Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" presents itself as an anti-system candidate, leading the polls.
His fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer of the Automotive Week industry journal.
In December 2017, Audi head Rupert Stadler, who was incarcerated and on leave, announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we achieved an important milestone in the resolution of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer had made "significant organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had adjourned a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and intends to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust values after the emission frauds have become known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Bram Schot, Chief Sales Officer, heads the company as acting Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronner Stimme".
In principle, he sees a falling demand for saloons such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electric mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, 15,000 reservations would already be made.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm is to join the DFB-Presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for office as DFB President next year.
"I do my work and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early on Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again for a re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "advisable" if, after the contract for the Football-EM 2024, he did not "have the desire to work on the future project".
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Federal Day on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organiser Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB-Presidium.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to advise the Bureau in this role and then of course be warmly invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the affair with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future an international without a migration background should become integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is held by the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says "the issue is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs where integration must work," said Grindel.
Correctly decrease with half-wise scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A balance that measures not only my weight, but also the body fat content.
It can also display muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the sausage.

Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin started the new season of the Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up easily won 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
New addition Rokas Giedraitis was top scorer of the dominant Berliner with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators at his mandatory debut.
Ex-master Brose Bamberg won the mandatory debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 points.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
Karim Jallow was the first goalkeeper in coach John Patrick's team with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
In the Basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings topped the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Braunschweigers, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 race of the Baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We'll protect our citizens no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the city centre of Cologne was partially closed.
Several thousand policemen were in action - among them also snipers.
The Islam Association Ditib is in criticism because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Schrecksekunde
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have been promoting more commitment in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Commit wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival in the night to Sunday in front of some 600,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations, also appeared on stage during the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a shock second when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was gunshot, were afraid and tried to escape.
In a short time panic arose, people ran confused.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organiser Hugh Evans.
New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed people down from the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Those who wanted to get one had to read texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases on the Internet and spread them.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - booing calls for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He and his democratic colleague Chris Coons spoke out on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke out in the U.S. Senate's Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, thus hitting many women's minds.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse to the point of attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which Kavanaugh rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women who claimed to have experienced sexual assaults themselves confronted him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also come together with me in an elevator at any time," Flake said to the crowd at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends journalist's expulsion
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
At the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had entered the front row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption of the press conference.
The journalist's action caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
He had arranged for the man to be brought out by personal protectors.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies entirely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
There are many journalists in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades of imprisonment.
Also foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities: Only at the beginning of September the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but there are still trials against them in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz totally drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and handsome: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for its lively conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets her guests with some beer, some wine or even higher-percent drinks to loosen the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory singing inlays.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Horniest Day".
However, the trip to the far north was not good for the Municher.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely cuddled on it, the eyes only two small slits left.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
Directed to his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now won: "Rule one: NEVER goes to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And leave out the round of egg liqueurs that Ina throws at half past three.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish buns or - probably the most effective - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
It is not known how Ina Müller survived the nocturnal drinking.
But since she has been hosting the TV fun at the bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa is struggling with vandalism and rubbish
The entrance to the 36 km long railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and waste.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions are hardly visible.
Shards, cigarette dumps, garbage and rubbish, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the showpiece Bahnradweg in Rotkäppchenland a more than inglorious sight.
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also by others for some time, according to the cycling officer of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the cycling council.
So far, there has been no solution.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also contributed the topic to the local advisory council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
It is not only often loud, but also destroyed in the racks: posts are torn from the ground, trash cans are demolished, signs are folded, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
However, the actions were only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are angry that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is meeting place for drinking.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the bicycle traffic officer, who is now also concerned about the new bike site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it gets really expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe this sets the threshold significantly higher to attack common property.
This would, however, require a police patrol to come by in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße-Hügel.
He felt that it should be made more attractive.
One could be very satisfied with the frequency of the bike path so far.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany", said the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Ascherröder Straße in Treysa to be an extremely critical hazard.
There's no turning trail on the Haaße hill.
In the event of busy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic flows on both sides," she explains.
This is no problem for sporty drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
To present "D ein Lied für Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for Large and Small, Young and Experienced Musicians".
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family gathering with coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-time albather living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We have not yet experienced this in other parts of the city.
What did the copywriters see connected to?
At the places the Hiltruper See and Marktallee were particularly often mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit-like song.
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Time and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about her work.
So they learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke was able to report that he recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
Meanwhile, Alvin Jasic has placed a lot on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper Gastronomie.
Nevertheless, there was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others can also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup drummer, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of them, the children performed again for the finale - and even without electronic support sounded "rightly good", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year anniversary.
She rated the event as a complete success.
Everyone is "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams facing each other.
For each page there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which you - the old trick with the red slide - can not decipher until you have put them in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything by mistake.
On the maps, for example, it says from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
Second window.
Three dice.
==References==
These are the terms that have to be encrypted from now on.
Because here the concepts are not to be guessed, but codes.
Alternately one player per team is the encrypter.
He's getting a code card that might say "3.4.2."
In "Decrypto", it is not the terms behind the secret film that are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube", "fest" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not as far as possible; because this wins the game if he succeeds twice in cracking the code.
So the encrypter writes down and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "Lose" as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like "Party" would also be possible and "Prague" because he has been paying attention at school and knows the window fall there.
That's how it goes round by round, team by team.
One does not know the concepts of the opposite side - but it can be better combined with every hint that the encrypter gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, the rewrites should be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The fellow players probably have to study it quite long and extensively until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But those who have just started will be fascinated by how much feeling this inconspicuous game contains.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre prime "Codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game of less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if it's just about guessing and not winning points, it's also easy to invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach twice in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed Hitler's greetings in the Upper City of a passing police patrol, later he also noticed in the Upper City in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In a sober state, he must also be prosecuted for the use of trademarks of unconstitutional organisations.
Kommissionswerk Pressig was home to the Schubloks
The railway depot in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
A piece of railway history ended in 1991.
"When buffers popped on buffers, it was heard all over Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archived the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes squeaked and the wagons creaked.
That was pure railroad.
Statements that are symbolic of Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which has its apex in Steinbach am Wald after an ascent of about 220 metres.
In order to cope with this, train and push locomotives were formerly needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian parliament approved the construction of a railway depot with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, overhead line and railway mastery.
"The centrepiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and professional railway operator for 47 years.
From the railway depot (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben were also operated.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and train locomotives.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
Up to 1991, at least 10,000 weighings were still ranked per month.
In 1982 parts of the plant were broken down, in 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we did not intend to make better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport".
At Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 Years of Electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," remembers Georg Dinkel.
A little later, the end.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig shunting station was history.
"The shunters and inhibitors did the most difficult work in train traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Any misstep would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as Julia Görges had done before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world ranking thirds is either Julia Putinzeva from Kazakhsten or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Victory led 6:3, 4:2 against Dariah Kassatkina, when the Russian woman placed at number 13 gave up.
The Swabian is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Pleasure", a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach on the weekend.
With great relief registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the Special Opening "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" within the framework of the series "Art and Pleasure".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A great crowd of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He's been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
A little surprising, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already actively participated in the selection of artists in the past and have helped shape flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is again a 70-cent special postage stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased about the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical framing.
Walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau awaits the visitor on the right.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully provided with 20 wind wheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun shining through the bushwork in the background, the object seems fairytale-like and invites to linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental, who prefers to devote herself to the event 15 years K&G in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts, moving in the wind.
Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child" halfway.
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colourful fantasy image of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "wind play performance" to wander through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians also breathed their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more Sangesleben in the district.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbusch they launched the MGV 68 Albachten.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter".
"It will be full today," Chairman Jürgen Holstiege suspected, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
On the occasion of the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
On time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it became, festive clothes had been requested before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Encounter", but were comfortable at tables.
In between, there was a need for movement: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put the controls on and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honor that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten made the voice sound themselves.
Suitable for the occasion happy songs were announced.
Almost put: "Such a day, as beautiful as today".
Matching the exquisite grape juice, which many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In allusion to another cool drink sounded "Humulus lupulus", which is the Latin term for "hops".
Once again, the conductor of the choir was Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnbusch at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said, "He has such an easy way, it's a masterpiece that he does." Incidentally, this time not only men presented themselves vocally.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhymes.
Andreas Winterhoff also presented fine-sounding poetry.
There was also a big raffle.
The proceeds are intended to finance a visit to the Allwetterzoo to the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The ascender is marching.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is really well suited in League Three.
No sign of shyness or fracks, the independents do their thing.
And this at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city rival BW Aasee really good.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we've already made an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set the guests had a set ball.
"When they bring this to the finish line, such a game can already tip," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC with its experienced forces made everything clear and brought the full yield to the finish line.
"We all know who's on the other side of a derby like that.
That doesn't break our necks.
I have seen really good volleyball at times", Annacker did not quarrel with the 0:3 - and immediately went to the agenda.
Where the journey for the independents goes, seems not to be foreseeable after just three days of playing.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball." In any case, they no longer want to look down on the fourth league.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they will have to look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will take place in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dreamship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series might have had a complicity in her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dreamship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left forever.
The show, which made her a star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many colleagues I admired perceived me on an equal footing," Keller explains in conversation with the "Picture on Sunday".
At first she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "dreamship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so much."
She thinks it is possible that her husband at the time might have been quite envious, but "like many men, Hans was also afraid of conversations about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody "and he did not want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have misplaced myself", as she explains further.
She had always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw me as an emancipated woman, whom I was never really, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding, I sat in the dressing room crying and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why didn't it ever work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love far too naively".
The moth, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has ventured to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little light shy.
And the glaring radiance, in which a green carpet is dipped in the sixth ring, blinds him exceedingly.
But it's just a film festival, because more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
On this late Thursday evening, he staggers over the square in order to facilitate himself in the "Aquaclean WC oasis".
This is what the public toilet system, sponsored by a large sanitation company, is called, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The need facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks in the men's oasis for some reason.
So get out of here, across to the other side of the street: invited guests, who just entertained at the best level in the cinema next door to the opening film "Green Book", celebrate the start of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store as every year.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: The works shown come from the whole globe.
What you don't have to come up with in an article about this festival in order not to fall into sneak advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a volley around the antennae, which has put a good fairy on him, and two bully doormen wave him in actually.
Inside, the invited people crowd, dance to live music far after midnight, or let themselves be pretended by DJ rhythms to which they yell at each other, and rinse down exquisite snacks with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement oysters wait for slurping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut open, a chocolate fountain gushes.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The butterfly studies the sign at the escalator: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If this is two separate instructions, he's misled in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it's certainly already saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry dumps a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who's been advertising for that brand for years, isn't here that night either.
But there, between local celebrity, cash desk and kitchen items, a face that seems familiar to the observer passes by: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His leading actor shouldn't be far.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd, with almost sixty almost like a choir boy.
He's not being talked to, he's not gawking, he's being stomped at the most.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as inconsistency, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is pleased about the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to Cumbia rhythms with a player in the cabin, as shown in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, cheered by the players.
The Mexican second division had defeated the Leones Negros with 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Sending after last minute failure "destructed"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball club ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His protégés were "destructed" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - failure - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long periods, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we totally overslept", annoyed the ASV trainer.
The owners of the house quickly led with 8:1, even the early time-out which Bieletzki had taken, did not fruit at first.
"But then suddenly a jerk went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
For the break, the gap was only two goals.
Especially Sendens Bester, Marius Hintze, hit the stage one by one.
After the change, it became even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst balanced out at 15:15, then the relay changer led almost consistently.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Intrude the impartial into the action.
Bieletzki usually avoids trying to blame others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff collected, "was a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well in the back against seven men and threw again and again on the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory must come," Bieletzki completely served.
ASV gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - Police digs for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the remains of the woman.
On Saturday, operatives dug up a road near Marxgrün.
To this end, the road surface and several layers below it were removed, as police and prosecutor's office jointly reported.
According to new evidence, the missing person may have been buried not far from their place of residence at the time.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court, together with the prosecutor's office, has been working intensively again on the case.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators encountered an anomaly under the street near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.

Elon Musk, founder of electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his impending dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. stock exchange supervisor SEC filed a lawsuit out of court over misleading Twitter news in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla each pay 20 million dollars, and Musk also resigns as Chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Chairman of the Supervisory Board.
He's allowed to stay on board.
In the settlement, which still has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the electric car pioneer, who is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He had always acted in the spirit of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7th, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange and pay 420 dollars per share, the financing was secured.
That would have made Tesla a total of 72 billion dollars.
Later Musk rowed back: Tesla remains on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla will now have to find an external chairman, hire two independent board members, and set up a committee to monitor Musk's communications.

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel as Chancellor by 2021
After the squabbles of the past weeks, GroKo collects several low-level surveys.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the polling institute, the AfD increases by one meter to 17 percent, the SPD drops a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose one meter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value so far for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestag elections were held on Sunday, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the votes, according to Emnid.
This means that the grand coalition has currently lost the majority on the Sunday issue at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
Together, they received 53.4 percent in the 2017 Bundestag election.
Among the other parties, the range is also large: The AfD, the second-strongest party in several polls, reaches 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens achieve votes of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the percentage of votes cast.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
At present, only 48 percent of citizens find Merkel to be the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS showed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wants the grand coalition to hold a regular Bundestag election in three years, 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, Merkel also saw significant losses in popularity.
The Germans also judge dividedly whether Merkel should again run for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against.
As a result, 64 percent of the Union's supporters do not want a candidacy, 35 percent do not want a candidacy.
Hanging at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of the digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a place of acquaintance for the great love radiates almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short snacks at the table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being less a contact but rather a slippery stock market.
We dared the test: How do women react, in the first message you don't talk long around the hot porridge?
Here's the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood Lovestory potential is when love happiness is preceded by an eye-lost and rediscovered plot.
If the guy calls his beloved at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, it sounds like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus, the author of this advertisement in an Aldi branch unknown to us, is quite to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she has briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat".
For her belief in the magic of analogue acquaintance, she definitely deserves her Happy End à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has been involved in the action "Deckel gegen Polio - 500 Deckel für eine Leben ohne politäten".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The condition known in German as polio leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany polio is considered to be eradicated, but there are still three countries worldwide where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be controlled by vaccination, as a press release states.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about form and fitness by Mario Götze.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
It's not good for the boy.
And that doesn't do us any good," said Götze-friend Reus after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen at the TV station Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no hurry with a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We have not even talked about a treaty yet.
There's no fixed date when we're gonna do this.
"But there will certainly be the moment where we sit down and talk," Eberl said on Sunday evening in the TV channel Sky.
Football: Bezirksliga: Researcher appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his own.
Wortkarg gave himself, the coach of the football district club VfL Wolbeck, retired first (inside) to ponder about the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
It's all history.
Meanwhile, it runs around the Brandhoveweg again.
Taufrischer proof is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only very thinly passed the ascent.
Yes, I'm very pleased with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and visited every single one after the match to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg came - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes waited for balls in the front line.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost that would have been revenged when the SCA hit in minute 41 twice in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously in front of the Wolbecker caste - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL took over the full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed scarcely.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes input.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch of the left side again missed a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute of Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the placekeepers 18 meters in front of the guest housing.
The fouled man himself started and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right flap struck down left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
20 more minutes, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty room in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Bange Minuten had to survive Wolbeck in the final phase, before Geske still had the victory hit on the punch in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4:1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five match days - coach Adi Hütter could not do that.

Helicopters crashed in Kottingbrunn
At the landing, there was an accident at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
At 2 p.m. on Sunday at the airfield in Kottingbrunn a drama occurred.
When a helicopter landed, there was turbulence, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was captured by a gust of wind, crashed onto the ground and came to a halt laterally.
The police, rescue and fire department were immediately notified.
With a large contingent, the forces came to the accident site.
The ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one damage to property.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to go home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of the investigation.
According to firefighter Franz Resperger, there was a small fire that could be extinguished quickly.
Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As the report "The Power of Monoculture" shows, which will be officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and which was presented to the German Press Agency in advance, only 8 percent of the Executive Board members were female on September 1st.
"The companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said Wiebke Ankersen, Managing Director of the Foundation.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male-occupied management teams - with few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
The gap makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
Moreover, the slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies was due solely to positive impulses in the medium-sized value index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the executive boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
At the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again next year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signaled that they would not continue to make a commitment to increase their share of "zero percent" so far.
A different picture emerges among the supervisory boards: As of 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If an equal number of women were recruited for the executive boards each year, a share of 40 percent would have been achieved as early as 2023," the report says.
Some even make mischief: Luxury bodies: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves best.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the noble providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and business professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros in operating profit with every car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put their weight on every car.
With prices ranging from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros before interest and taxes, Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well on track for EBIT.

Torch procession for the opening of the 60th Abtswinder wine festival
The tourist association opened its wine festival session in Abtswind with a torchlight procession.
For the 60th time, the association organizes the wine festivals, which will rise every Saturday in October in the large tent on the Rehweiler Straße.

The chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already proppenvolle festival tent. "Sixty years of organizing something like this - this is an amazing achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Weinprinzessin Lisa II. later symbolically met the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many have found their way to Abtswind again." Later, "The Troglauer" caused a stir.
On Sunday, on which Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had set the drinks prices as 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival will take place on Friday, 5 October, in the guest's house, before going into the second round one day later in the marquee.
In Bonn: Emergency medical car crashes in taxi
An ambulance stands heavily damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passer-by was fatally injured.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best even save human lives.
Such a rescue trip took a deadly end for a 26-year-old in Bonn.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in the collision of an ambulance with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, as the police reported.
On Saturday afternoon, the 46-year-old driver of the ambulance car had hit a red light with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then bumped into a junction with the taxi that was driving at Grün.
After the collision, the doctor's car hurled against a traffic light pole and a tree.
He captured the passer-by who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of the ambulance and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from emergency personnel.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another called emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn Public Prosecutor's Office, investigate who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we find it uncomfortable
After the disgraceful end in the League Cup, Manchester United is now also losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1:3. The way of defeat should still be there to talk.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute, when Marko Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all of Manchester's defensive players stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of a previously already over long distances insufficient performance.
The mood at United's Manchester City rival is very different at the moment.
The Citizens, coached by Mourinho's big competitor Pep Guardiola, came against Brighton & Hove Albion in a rough 2-0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the defense bar of the outsider for the first time for the home team.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goal scorer Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri defeated Chelsea in the Premier League with Liverpool.
Like the Cup-off, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who came on the field for Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After the Reds had started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea was not beat for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and now the Reds in the League have knocked the Blues Liverpool off the top of the league.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 victories.
However, fans of the Gunners, in whom Granit Xhaka played, had to wait for a success report until the 81st minute against the surprise team from Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defenseman Craig Cathcart unluckyly added Alex Iwobi to his own goal, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal for the season.
Thanks to the fifth consecutive victory, Arsenal passed Watford and is now just behind the big rival Tottenham in fifth place.A strong impression continues to be left to uplifter Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten in the 2-0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and finished 8th.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show dedicated to diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet omnipresent: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let the German car companies go even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showing their new products in the French capital from next week together with competitors from all over the world.
The diesel doesn't really play a big role in this anymore.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should still be an important topic at least behind the brilliant backdrops of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have among other things their first pure electric models: The e-tron of the Ingolstädter will be on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
Both have been officially presented.
The iNext from BMW is scheduled to start in 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3 Series.
This year, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a good one million visitors came.
The major earthquakes and the following tsunami killed at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and traffic connections are damaged, and there has been enormous damage to property.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims will increase significantly.
So far, the figures are only from Palu.
However, numerous other municipalities are also affected - along the west coast of Sulawesi.
About 150 bikers celebrate divine service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final divine service for the motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking with a team of helpers on Sunday.
Werdohl - The square in front of the church of peace in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the agenda.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong two-wheeler drivers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) at Haus Nordhelle takes place on the last Sunday of a month.
Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to celebrate a worship service that was anything but ordinary.
Already from 10 o'clock the Bolids were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker early school was on the program and it was possible to strengthen itself with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given by Pastor Dirk Grzegorek during the Biker service.
The musical background was provided by singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill is more of a poetic-quiet tune," said Father Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big celebration: after the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active at the actual day of action.
She supplied her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also attracted great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated step by step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice to his amazed spectators.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the large funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how this would turn into a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step this late Friday afternoon.
Wrapped in shapes and covered by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which look a little like chippings, layer by layer.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step was not so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the farmer had already bottled specialities with him.
So he opened his treasure chest and presented the latest feather white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Fuchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents came into conversation, while the children were not only able to follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Also activists of the Füchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers engaged themselves during the festival and invited at some stations to entertaining games.
The home club will also offer an action day in the coming year.
Then, however, according to Gregor Krützkamp, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of events.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: finally, it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season-pile: "Fucking situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
However, there was not much positive in the previous 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," said 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "Of course, that's disappointing, because you always do a lot of things."
The further victoryless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met to the connection, stand with two meters at the very bottom and are in their current constitution a candidate for descent.
Leading by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated its first home win in the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46.300 spectators, who advanced to the middle of the table with seven points after the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio Rom.
Croatia's vice world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse during his start-up debut and never got a grip on Hanover's defenses.
With his speed and assertiveness, the striker, who had been beaten for a long time after the World Cup, showed why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was loaned by Liverpool FC, was also the first time in the initial formation of Frankfurt, which began swinging.
Lucas Torró's (17th) headball, which was forged on the net of the goal, brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defense of the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back) in the short term.
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penitentiary after a corner that had been turned off, Haller extended his head to the goal, where Ndicka only had to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender who came in the summer from the French second division club AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt dropped even before the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who was able to fill up and 96-gate guard Michael Esser didn't stand a chance.
During the half-time Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak performance of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Niedersachsen played a little more courageously forward, but sparking ideas remained until shortly before the end, when after all, the connection hit succeeded.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After a short hour Rebic started a solo and then laid across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only show running for the Frankfurters against overburdened guests, also Jovic hit one minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes the party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Munich mayor Dieter Reiter made it to the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two beats.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Heilig-Kreuz-Fest on September 14th or on Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the church of the Holy Cross with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, who dates from the 30-year-old war and is said to have been shot at by a Swedish soldier, according to legend.
Blood flowed from the gunshot wound.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
This is not finished to this day, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the Cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the importance for the Geisinger parish, the divine service was badly attended.
After the divine service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and with the final blessing the church part of the Feast of the Cross ended.
For many years, the Catholic church choir then invites to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish home.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon the parish still offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has already stood for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual calls for tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but more has also been determined, which was only possible by the inspection by means of scaffolding.
The plinth plastering works have been completed, before the winter the natural stone work is to be started and it is hoped that more than half of these works will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New dormitory in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new dormitory for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That in Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" will be handed over to his destiny - all those present agreed at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residence of the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Larger corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officer building of the US Army was put to the test for the residents with mobile phone cap: "The house had come into age and no longer up-to-date in the equipment", explained Bader in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved in to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
The Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2,4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work remained within the planned framework - both in time and financially.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that let the inhabitants experience the freedom to move even without foreign help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the Schwaben district, also said: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants, who need tools to be mobile."
The homeliness and functionality had been well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this location is a real luck case, because it is no longer to be acquired in today's situation".
In total, the new dormitory on Münsterblickstraße offers space on almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, who are divided into three residential groups.
Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to the tariff.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, Deputy SPD Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unit.
We must not be satisfied with these differences", said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It was unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than the people in West Germany, but were paid 15 percent less.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, about one year old, reached their receiver already on Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food in order to "facilitate the habitation" of the animals.
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North had announced the gift of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the 2032 Olympic Games.
Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion in the course of mutual rapprochement.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this commemorative year, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director general of the Austrian State Archives, makes it quite different in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to the technical work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the grand coalition that begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU last did not conjure up the "return to the work in kind".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and work, but be it.
If the Federal Government is now ready to return to its mission - to govern - it should not be prevented from doing so by debating terms.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last weeks may already be shown by Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties come together for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early on; a lesson from all this dispute.
First of all, however, issues of conflict are again on the agenda with the diesel retrofits and the law on immigration of skilled workers.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU regard the manufacturers as mandatory for the technical retrofitting of older diesel.
While a rapprochement has emerged over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned immigration law for skilled workers.
The SPD calls for a perspective of staying for rejected asylum seekers who work or do training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "purse change" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equals and equals have joined forces for GroKo, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
Fighting's good.
Without dispute, a society characterised by such diverse and sometimes contradictory interests does not move forward.
In order to be constructive, however, quarrels must not again be raised to the question of being or not being for party tactical reasons.
It's still about politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD should fight - but always have in mind the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be solved pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, that is why the People's Party must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the sights
Is the Minister of Labour violating the applicable law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Really day and night" their legists had been working on the social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
In Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, Beate Hartinger-Klein's (FPÖ) statement is surprising - she brings the matter now to Parliament via question.
She assumed "that the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and did not want to announce any violations of applicable service law in front of running cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to "acquit Hartinger from any suspicion".
Police tear up a street in search of women's oaks
Marxgrün - The police did not want to comment on this for a long time.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, excavations have been carried out on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was preceded by the fact that the investigators had previously set up an archeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to narrow down the relevant area to a few metres, together with its guide in repeated use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian conservation authority in the area of the said street.
For more than a year now, the prosecutor's office and the Criminal Police Court have been working on the missing persons' case.
Time and again a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that Heike's body might have been buried here 30 years ago in the course of the new construction of the state road.
Colour powder and eggs: Riots in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But there are riots before that.
The separatists have not forgotten the police mission of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan referendum on independence on 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and police took place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked with paint powder by the supporters of independence, among other things, in order to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3000 police officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil units wanted to honor their colleagues who were involved in the illegal referendum last year in the polling stations.
At the time, violence had also occurred when it was trying to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the approximately 6000 separatists would then have violently tried to break the police chain, throwing paint bags and eggs at the officials, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, according to the authorities.
On Monday, the Independence Referendum is celebrating its first anniversary.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to separate the prosperous region from Spain, the central government in Madrid put Catalonia under compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in custody.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the compulsory administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Aggregated perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split goalless
Red-White Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
==References====External links==*Official website
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion, they found the final light and the third last to be a congregated perplexity.
The first half was very manageable by the entertainment factor.
Those who wanted to get a beer or a sausage could do so without concern.
There was no danger of missing a chance, because there was virtually no chance.
First shot after half an hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock in the 28th minute was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the whole game.
The Ahleners had the best - and in principle only real - opportunity, when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG gatekeeper Frederic Westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty room border.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stormer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel from 18 meters aimed just above the housing and after an hour also the Gütersloher appeared for the first time offensively.
After a ball-conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz, it went fast.
Nick Flock (62.) "crowned" the quickly performed counter to Sinan Aygün with a lax shot in the arms of RWA gatekeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a head ball by Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball by ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, initially bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
The Ahleners did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but they didn't bring anything.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero". But unfortunately the zero also stood in the front.
"This time we weren't as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede and that even though our opponent didn't want to play here," stated RW Ahlens Interimtrainer.
Offensively, "everything was a bit clumsy" against a team that "just wanted to defend.
Anyway, I didn't have the feeling that we could get a back gate," Daut said.
However, to his regret, as a spectator, one did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Thanksgiving market: Fortunately there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for which these donations are intended, are delighted.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening the sky was bright blue, but the place was still a little empty, but this should change during the day.
Because: "It's so social here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit with a good touch of humour as always.
Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice for the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed against food.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough creimers.
And the "replacement" could not be taken away, in between musically entertaining the more and more growing visitors.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at a later hour.
"Just great," rejoiced Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is happy about the many active people with their stands, among them mainly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a blackboard," he thanked nevertheless for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivals that took place in September and the "Clean up" campaign.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful painting - here something goes.
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück took off the Maikranz with the help of the fire brigade and brought it to the winter quarters.
Many stalls worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty was everything to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative at his decopier saw.
He had veneer work, beer lids with Reckenfeld motifs and a lot more on offer.
Three Reckenfelder beekeepers offered a speciality: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought with them by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has another specialty.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
As little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that allowed the visitors to stay for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage programme that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrication with a local political message: No successful advertising for skate equipment
In Lengerich, unknown people have promoted the construction of a skate facility in a way that is hardly conducive to success.
According to Jürgen Kohne from the municipal administration, there are several appropriate briberies on request from the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for damage to property.
In large letters the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" were displayed on signs at the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro had already been discovered after the trade fair on 19 September.
Since the short message was apparently "only" left with an Edding at the time, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later this was again there, this time sprayed on," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the appropriate advertising sign must be replaced.
This case gets a special note because several large companies from Lengerich are also called on the board.
If the skate facility is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without mentioning names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the subject of skate facilities.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the majority of the council voted in favour of the fire park.
However, this suggestion was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a building at this point.
A reversal followed at the end of June.
The members of the main and financial committee voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word then has the city council.
He expects a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Traffic congestion in air traffic control is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement next year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said Matthias Maas, head of the Air Traffic Control Union, the German Press Agency, before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures was the long-known staff shortage in European air traffic control services, for which there was no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots lasts four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Europe-wide, the market for pre-trained pilots has been emptied.
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe alone for surveillance of the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticised the fact that several aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the federal, state, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic city on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work consolidation and overtime, it won't work without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German air traffic control agency.
Maas again blamed the EU Commission for the pilot Miserere.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and staff savings in national air traffic control systems are now fully in line with operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut off air traffic control even further".
At present, the EU targets would be agreed by 2024 and further tightening would be feared.
The EU was exposed to constant lobby pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high delay costs would change the way airlines thought.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offers a "consistent training and future pact", Maas said.
The previously announced admission of 120 pilots each year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the wishes of Thyssenkrupp interim head Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-ridden group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in staff beyond the already known administrative cuts.
After two resignations, the controlling body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50 percent stake in the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demonstrations of police and Catalan supporters of independence.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police officers and Catalan supporters of independence in Barcelona have resulted in violent clashes with numerous injured.
According to the city administration, some 3,000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police had tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other with a large bid.
According to the forces, however, supporters of independence repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and bullets.
According to the information, there were also fights between the participants of the various protest marches.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police reported that there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police had wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had fought almost exactly one year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn much more than they do.
The demonstrators found it a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they beat us up a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who have only done their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is for enforcing our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona, because it is a great European city and there is more echo here.
However, he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the policeman assured him.
Failed access to personal data British Minister
A security vulnerability in a mobile app has caused the personal data of ministers and representatives of the conservative British Tory Party to be temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known the day before the Tory Party Day in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning, the Hannover police report a serious traffic accident on Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettenbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people were killed driving their car against a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The operatives are on site.

Football: Juve-Trainer praises after top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star-stormer "played the best game this evening along with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively bought star was the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's good," Allegri said.
Even if we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to the three goals of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early fall due to the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and suspended the worst chaser for the time being.
The goal hunter brought by Real Madrid first laid down the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26./49.).
And Ronaldo, after a corner by headball, also did the preliminary work for the hit of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who just had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," the coach praised.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve shooter is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the power of Juventus seems to become even more overwhelming.
Seven victories in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years has already six points ahead of Naples.
==References====External links==*BDFutbol profile*Butbolme profile*Butbolme profile*Butbolme profile*Butbolme profile
But at the latest after the place reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top part was decided.
The Portuguese had to climb too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the field.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.
The German national player has prevailed in Juve.
==References====External links==*BDFutbol profile*BDFutbol profile
The midfield player also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown from the square in the 2-0 victory of the Turiners and is locked for the home match on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly bizarre performance rapper Kanye West has attracted attention at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused the audience to frown and question marks.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From then on, let's just call him "Ye," according to the musician.
"The creature that was formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince when he dropped his stage name.
The pseudonym, however, is not news.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had declared that "Ye" had a religious significance for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you," says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
We did it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was simply more gripping, we almost never put him before problems." Accordingly, the list of Hoetmar bullets reads thinly.
Just two chances to score in 90 minutes, so only rarely games can be made positive.
Football district league A1: SC Hoetmar subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first run, but the first took advantage of Maik Krause from a sharp angle to the early lead (7.).
Steffen Uphus could have increased in the 43rd minute, but after great preliminary work by Krause, he moved freely.
The hosts only had a double opportunity when Moritz Höne at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher first failed and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper in the shot.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61st) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all forgave.
A commercial meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide staggered the ball over the line was the match decided (81.).
"We had criticized ourselves before, which was different today than in the last few weeks," concluded Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Gates: 0:1 Krause (7th), 0:2 Berheide (81st).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think about that," he grumbled after words.
"We didn't get any access to them at all," he said, supposedly referring to the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also to all the other green-whites who noticed with a collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he still said, winking cheekily and pulling away from then on His players, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, the Albachtens, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class preservation.
With understandable mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"As we come back after the 0:2, as we hold against one of the league's top teams over the entire season, that was really phenomenal."
Therefore, it is all the more bitter that one must now go home empty-handed.
Top goal hunter Lars Zymner brought the hosts with his 12th goal in the lead (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2-0 he laid over the left side exemplary for Fabian Frohning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't completely take out a player like that.
"That was already madness what he did," Lewandowski enviously acknowledged the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own eleven made the balance: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhalter Hinkerohe into the long goal (45th).
After the change of sides it was again McGill who scored the balance (59.).
Then we went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann struck off (69th).
Despite the excess number Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80.) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Gates: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74th/Albacht).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duell between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The leader had actually come for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: All Presidium of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire executive committee of football second league player Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
In the evening, several media called for a joint letter from the committee of the Saxons.
At first there was no confirmation of the club.
The reason for the withdrawal is supposed to be internal power struggles with the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Celebrity guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to pick up the price of tolerance in person in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
This was how Academy Director Udo Hahn counted him when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors were already with us". However, the fact that celebrities keep appearing at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic during the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective.On 29 September, the writer Frido Mann will attend a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also agreed to accept the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him personally in Tutzing, which is also awarded to television presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it in themselves.
"The pension is not safe!" is in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And a meeting on Syria: "Barbarism without a limit".
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death - the war mocks every humane idea".
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change in work through digitalization.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "Free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions."
At a meeting on the 200th.
Karl Marx's birthday will soon be expected by some more visitors to the direction of capitalism criticism, while the others are more likely to see a tendency "from the left to the centre".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music cabaret: gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner plotted gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat at the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes also comes to the conclusion of the sentence, on the other hand a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies so congenially harmoniously that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also that, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely the way it suited the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: the satisfaction of the man comes if he has a partner, but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does no good.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have emerged from Mozart's composing if "the Nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?
Thus Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wounden" into the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's G minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck could not take an additional thank you.
She had the idea to treat the duo to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.

The controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk is allowed to remain CEO of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, but must resign as Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Musk also agreed with the US stock exchange regulator SEC to pay a double-digit million penalty, as the SEC announced.

After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police corrected the number of victims slightly downwards.
Ten passengers were slightly injured instead of 15.
Everyone has since been released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night.
He was released during the day, said a police spokesman.
The reason for the accident of the long-distance bus at Bruchsal is still unclear.
On Saturday morning, the long-distance bus crashed head-on against a guardrail.
Handball: Women's Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlener women had problems mainly with the third division player Carolin Stallmann, who alone scored ten goals.
"Actually I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player made too many goals.
We didn't get a grip on them," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more angry about the many missed opportunities.
The concentration in the finals made his team miss this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end a lag behind, lay at the break at 11:12 and later still at 15:18 (45.) behind.
Only towards the end did the wider bank of the hostesses make itself decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu set back room Merle Klement on the left, which then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
The Blue-Whites won 3:1 at the VC Allbau Essen.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the upper third of the league.
We have now worked this out," said coach Dominik Münch, looking forward to an almost impeccable performance by his team at the downfall of the table leader.
The guests dominated the first passage almost at will.
About 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the vice-champion of the previous year at 25:15.
Food took in the two-bar, but it didn't come into play.
We kept her busy.
Our opponent has struck with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second set the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen has switched the assumption to triple bars.
We couldn't hold the impact pressure.
Food sucked in, and we got a little lulled in," Münch continued.
At the 18:17 the volleyball players from the Ruhr had the first advantage.
Although Ostbevern was still defending four set balls in the 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," the instructor found at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and Wiebke Silke finally contributed significantly to the BSV turning the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly."
About 7:3 and 15:13 brought the blue and white passage four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dirtmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"The mosque opening in Cologne has left a pile of pieces in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be painstakingly brought together," said Gökay Sofuoglu, chairman of the German editorial network, TGD.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of highlighting Muslims' belonging to Germany side by side with German leaders, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu lamented.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "reinforced many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break is finally Folktreff time again.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 7.30 pm the home club Nottuln already organizes its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost to the day exactly it is then a year ago that we have carried out for the first time a Folktreff.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk meeting would be so fast in Nottuln.
No matter if storm deep Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"As always, the program at the next Folktreff is a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old Schlagern," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites his friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer and his accordion agreed on the first Folktreff "birthday".
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with German lyrics.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The creators of the Folktreff are happy to remember the last event in the summer when Christoph Schulz from Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht" inspired the audience and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend a sociable and humorous evening once again," says the home club's invitation.
Anyone who plays an instrument and has the desire to actively participate is invited to participate.
Since the sought - after seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on the way to becoming the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority approved the proposed merger, Linde informed on Sunday.
This means that the multi-billion-dollar merger is still pending approvals in South Korea and - as the largest hurdle - in the USA.
Finally, according to an insider, the chances of obtaining approval had improved there because Linde promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall, the 125th anniversary of the District Association for Horticulture and Regional Care was celebrated.
On 29 September 1893, the last impulses for the foundation of the Kulmbach District Association for Horticulture and Regional Care were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday evening, he celebrated a big anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
At that time, however, it was called "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (Kulmbach Town and Country District Building Association) and was founded by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was different from today's work - it was actually about fruit-growing, about flowers and gardening nobody thought back then.
"At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his ceremonial lecture.
Fruit trees were to line highways, and so-called industrial gardens were built in schools.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But this does not mean that the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village embellishment and nutrition play an equally important role, as do the transfer of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwerfen" showed entertainingly on stage how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said county chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a lot of joy with smartphone & co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides", added Söllner, stressing the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county also left no doubt about the district managing director and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the district association with a lecture on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was ingested.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden turned into a decorative and residential garden.
"Nature has survived, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it", the expert pleaded for fruit and nut trees.
That is why the horticultural associations are encouraged not to give up, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian Association.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif, who was solemnly framed by the tower blowers of the Thurnau music club.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister moves UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: they provide both trading partners with an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will speak only on Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, her spokesman, Adam Austen, announced.
In the meantime, she focuses on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo stated on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between its country and the United States.
The United States and Mexico agreed on a recast of the Nafta regional free trade agreement in August.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
They are to be concluded by Sunday evening (local time), and Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-designate Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, wounded in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report from the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on an open street at the beginning of September during an election campaign in South Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht") women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations mobilized against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynistic statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally of the Brazilian Workers Party (PT) presidential candidate Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As ex-mayor of the megacity of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but recently presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reaches the absolute majority in the first round, there will be a runoff election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from it successfully - no matter who he is competing against.
Bolsonaro is known for incitement against homosexuals and blacks and for glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula's left-wing workers' party should be shot.
Europe recovers Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour away from Disneyland, the European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale at the gates of Paris.
The outsider team of Captain Thomas Björn dethroned the favored defending champion USA around a toothless Tiger Woods in front of more than 150,000 spectators on the three days in the Le Golf National with great punches and outstanding team spirit.
After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 years after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen shared on Larsen's website.
On the deathbed Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become acquainted with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music stars such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band's dissolution in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had performed at the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rocknacht in der Schuhfabrik: Volume at press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock from three bands with another friend.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no sign of stage fright.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands inspire the 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night visibly.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage the band dances to the harmonious and powerful interplay of the band.
Although "Zugabe" calls cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that hard rock is not the same as hard rock with their alternative, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the yearning, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" captivates by the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuchen has gained a special reputation since it was founded in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with her appearances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China from 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.
In collaboration with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
In addition to the sound, which seems to be even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a cheered solo while he runs through the audience.
A certain volume is of course part of this genre due to such a hard rock concert: According to the mixing console team, the "Mint Mosquito" rock night is about 98 decibels at the three-way concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition".
This is, for example, at the press hammer level, but is thus still clearly below the triggers of the "wacken fesitval", pointing to the "Ignition" on their website.
Ear deafening 120 decibels in jet volume as usual in the north of the republic, however, the Ahlen audience does not need to do this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking gang have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, took the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger", all three groups, of course in the figurative sense, can say at the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead man in a glider accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
There has been a fatal accident at Mülheim/Essen airport.
A glider crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near Mülheim/Essen airport.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider had crashed on the fair parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is supposed to be a one-seater.
The plane had already arrived at the time of the accident.
The crash site is only a short distance from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But there has been an Oktoberfest since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located at the city border of the two cities of the Ruhr and directly at the entrance to the highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at major events at the Essen Fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that North Korea’s leader Kim, despite the nuclear crisis, is quite well disposed.
But now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's beautiful letters.
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has declared himself a new flame.
The tragedy: it's a long-distance relationship.
Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in public on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia Trump found almost tender words for the half-old offspring of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although it proves to be quite tough in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, so was he, and we went back and forth," Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Her personal connection had also borne political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even if critics see little more than lip service behind it.
According to Trump's nickname for Kim, the U.S. president seemed quite aware that the affection for the notorious "Rocket Man" - which is infamous for his martial threatening gestures - should not be common to everyone.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism of his appearance in a large indoor sports hall in Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That's so impresidial.
But he cares very little about it, explained Trump and then pointed his index finger at the crowd: "I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidential."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this crowded arena, but we would only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visited, atmospheric and on top of that spoiled with sun: Very varied and with a good shot Oktoberfestflair Baesweilers downtown has cleaned up on Sunday.

Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile video to point out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya, thus enabling them to be rescued.
The group had shot the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under life risk and distributed it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya while trying to get to Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he put himself in danger according to his own statement.
One of his comrades was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the detention conditions were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year with the help of the programme, said Jorge Galindo, the IOM spokesman in the West African country.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a call for help via mobile video.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as unworthy of human dignity.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building across the main entrance.
In the front of the first floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher contacted the police who started the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot be said yet.
Description of perpetrator: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark trousers, dark T-shirt.
Information to the Obernberg Police Inspectorate at the Inn, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in Central Franconia after he had stuck the car off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue forces accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and released the missing person since Tuesday evening, the police reported on Sunday.
According to the information, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home now.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride in his off-road vehicle across the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search measures, the man's whereabouts had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey in conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan according to his own statements.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at the Cologne airport.
This concerns above all the waves of arrest, press and religious freedom.
He therefore made it "clear at Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite".
Laschet also reportedly referred to the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He had put forward the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan had once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's readiness to fly at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne after the conversation.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their point of contact - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump does not tire of stressing the success of the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington's concessions.
North Korea's Secretary of State Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula in the UN general debate with its ongoing sanctions.
"The recent stalemate comes from the US relying on coercive measures that are lethal to confidence building," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean Chief Diplomat.
The fact that punishment measures could force North Korea to "knee" is "a dream of people who do not know us".
In order to build confidence, however, his country had stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri emphasized.
However, there had been no "corresponding reactions" from the US side, the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council had adopted sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pushing the United Nations for strict compliance with the sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump had met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will return to Pyongyang for talks on ending the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting place, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing of it: white blankets and flower decoration on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The youths of the HoT had conjured the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: A power failure had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," says Westbuer.
And so everyone took part.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"Cooks can't do better either," one visitor praised, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," stressed Father Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammern with card tricks and other tricks was astounding.
Jürgen Sator leaves the Land Executive Committee NRW of the Tafel
The head of the Essen Table, Jörg Sartor, has resigned from his post in the Landesverband out of frustration over criticism from his own ranks.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice-chairman of the NRW-Tafeln, said Sartor of the "Welt am Sonntag".
Too many fell in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the Land Association of Tables NRW, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy to the dpa.
Sartor took the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his step - there were people who didn't know exactly why the Essener Tafel did it."
But Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday" Sartor again criticized criticism of colleagues from other boards.
One should not follow the approach, "without us the people in the city are starving".
It is the duty of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not take part in a congress of tables on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm being told too much sweet stuff," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies who criticized me so much at the time.
Play SF Lorch 2:0-Führung - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, district league Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after behind - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home match against the TV Neuler - at the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
The TV Heuchlingen is quite different: In Kirchheim the TVH quickly got behind with 0:1, but won after 90 minutes with 2:1. At the top of the table, the SGB was able to achieve a 3-0
Gladbach playful double lead - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
In the 2:2 the foals play a two-time lead.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first win of the season (1:0).
(sda) Four times in the first five league matches, Schalke has maneuvered to the sidelines with early goals.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again showed the strength with which it took the first place behind the Bayern in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home equipe in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Evgeni Konopljanka by head, in the following the hosts conserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback Borussia Dortmund again greets from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had negotiated a 0:2 reserve against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came to the 4-2 victory in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) balanced with a doublette within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63. minute, provided with another doublette in the final phase (86./94) for the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
VfB Stuttgart also won the first victory.
Due to a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, Werder Bremen was already decimated before the break.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler created a curious insertion-owner, which helped the guests in the 68th minute to balance.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also no failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
Gladbacher, with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave a lead twice, played 2:2 and have been waiting for an away win in VW City since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's balance to the 1:1 with his second Bundesliga Ligator.
Yann Sommer was powerless at the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, as was the second match after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa shows himself to be a goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
The French record purchase made by OGC Nice hit Wolfsburg for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh mandatory game.
After seven laps Gladbach takes 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously undefeated Werder Bremen maneuvered against the VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable situation.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter that the ex-Luganese Anastasios Donis finished with his first goal of the season.After 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: The 23-year-old Serbe took a jersey pick against Daniel Didavi Gelb-Rot.
Although Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back into the game through a curious throw-in goal (68.), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarter back to the Siegesstrasse.
Nuremberg won the duel against Düsseldorf 3-0.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens set the home team on course by means of foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million citizens are voting today on whether the name of their country should be changed in northern Macedonia.
If yes, the almost three decades of smouldering conflict with Greece’s neighbour could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and had blocked any approach of Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future of Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member in the event of a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrians in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three retired women and injured them in part.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker randaled in the escape lane in Alsergrund at around 10 p.m. on Friday.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who went after passers-by with clenched fists and tried to attack them, about his behaviour.
Then the Syrian tried to beat and kick the officials.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had hit three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists at a tram stop on Währinger Straße shortly before.
He had also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered haematoma, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for a still unknown cause", as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored continuously during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two of them said yes.
Kahrs had previously told the "Image" newspaper that a registered life partnership was not in question for them.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a fiscal spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir with a rage on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"That was your Shabowski moment," he said, alluding to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in adoption law.
Garden day: cut 400 meters hedge
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the citizens' association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprosy.
Because around 400 meters hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, Chairman of the Association of Citizens.
And it has accumulated a lot.
Because of the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a form cut.
Already in the spring the hedge had already been shaved.
The breakfast always following the work has also a long tradition.
"Everyone should remain strong," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Kanoslalom World Championships
Hannes Aigner from Augsburg won the gold medal at the conclusion of the canoe slalom world championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on Sunday on the Olympic track.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had enough rides here on the grounds and everything was fine today," said the Olympic third of London 2012.
At the finish he threw his paddle away with joy and raised both arms victoriously - knowing well that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had takeoff number four.
However, the six remaining starters could not top his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
The second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russian Pavel Eigel.
The police inspection Gauting reports the first attempt to break into a single-family house this autumn.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - this is what burglars want to take advantage of again.
So the police inspection Gauting reported yesterday the first attempt to break in this autumn.
The fact that it remained in the attempt at the family house on Königswieser Straße is due to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
The alarm, however, surprised them so much that they took the run without prey.
Notes to PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Broke at Hertha: caught up with reality: Bavaria challenged against Ajax
The title is unbeatable: FC Bayern "does not want to let down" the defeat in Berlin.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate conclusion for Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small performance roll under the new coach Niko Kovac is not supposed to increase to a bigger autumn low for the Munichers.
"One week ago, we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now the reality has caught up with us a bit", Thomas Müller noted after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
If you know us, you know that this really bothers us and that's why we're gasping towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year no goal was scored, as at the same time of the preseason two compulsory games in series without victory, the table lead in the football Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund for the time being.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as at the end of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running-intensive man-against-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitches over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, just as the last seeming overpowering Bavaria should be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we will do everything we can to make it successful again," Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his native city and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the once again inadequate handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim conclusion of his term positive before the international season break - otherwise the tone is likely to intensify.
For example, Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second appearance of the season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second pre-round match against Ajax begins as planned, which had also conquered AEK Athens with 3-0.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again", announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke mainly plain text.
The right defender appeared in the role of Mahner.
"I don't think that's all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the many opportunities and make the mistakes in the back," the 23-year-old stressed shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bayern were already behind Dortmund with five points, which has now taken the lead again with a point advantage.
And so Kimmich with a wink at least appreciated that now the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack from Erdogan to Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in the permanent issue of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB boss defended the association line.
On early Sunday morning, Grindel, personally attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the causa in the ZDF "Sportsstudio" in Mainz.
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with a migrant background in the U-teams - that this does not happen again", said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migrant background as further integration commissioner.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had strongly denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded her from this society because they had my picture taken in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city.
To be honest, as their president, I couldn't digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, have been marginalized.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had started with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced his intention to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm migrant - I can't do that.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, that's what I always said.
However, he does not see a basis for a return to Özil's national team.
In addition to the Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is now to be appointed as a conclusion.
"If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says, "The issue is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs where integration must work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run again for office as DFB President next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic lights in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he was driving against her car.
However, there was no exchange of personal information, as the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone report about a driver who had left the road and driven against a guard post.
At that point, the man did not want a local police force and then drove away.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has lost his way in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and has rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Finally, the police could find and stop him.
His car had significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made an impression and couldn't remember much more.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 volunteers are still in use.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the bog fire on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 emergency personnel are still working on the extinguishing work.
The Bundeswehr announced this on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop in a stable manner, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of forces is planned, it is said.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week the disaster had been lifted, which was announced a week earlier on 21 September, because it had been feared that the flames would endanger adjacent forests and settlements by wind and spark flight.
Thursday then it was said that an attack of the fire on neighboring communities would no longer threaten.
At times, more than 1500 local forces tried to control the large fire.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned for October 2nd and 5th.
The fire had been triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the moor fire had for a time moved up to a hundred kilometers far over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point to receive damage reports.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two of them said yes.
Kahrs had previously told the "Image" newspaper that a registered life partnership was not in question for them.
If we get married, it's true.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a fiscal spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir with a rage on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"That was your Shabowski moment," he said, alluding to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in adoption law.
Referendum on new state names started in Macedonia
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its northern province of the same name, the neighbouring Greece.
As a means of exerting pressure, Athens has been blocking any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they also give the starting signal for their country's western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have been 90 years old on September 30.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner of 1986 dies in the USA in 2016 and leaves behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be removed with explicit consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
If necessary, your wishes can then be called up by Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs - as in Germany - can only be removed with explicit consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
According to Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation, 15 percent of Swiss people are expected to have a donor card.
But only in five percent of cases a card will be found at the crucial moment with possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the family members do not know the wishes of the deceased.
"You then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Immer.
A similar registration system is already in place in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information about possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesperson of the Federal Agency for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - per or counter organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, anyone would first be considered an organ donor, unless he or she disagreed.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head arithmetic
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in head arithmetic.
He prevailed in Wolfsburg against 39 competitors on the weekend.
This was shared by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest participant in the World Cup was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old retired from France, as chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks included: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, in which participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings were already two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
Organiser Laue can do little with terms like superbrain, genius or prodigy.
"Head arithmetic can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stage-oriented computational competitions.
One of the disciplines is, for example, the square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, the candidates get surprising tasks, for which they have to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans have good chances, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage, because even in early childhood head arithmetic is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Intrusive Appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows herself from her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to point out breast cancer and to fight for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings top without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate parts.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died from it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams herself would have died almost a year ago.
Her daughter Alexis Olympia was born with complications.
Emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans to significantly extend the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will launch an appropriate bill on the so-called "Symbols Act" in review.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shakes her beds out for the first time in the west next week: Polare Kaltluft reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 meters at strong intensity, they said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become therefore wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start the annual curvature on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start the annual buckling care on Monday.
The "green ramparts", unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the low-forest federal state for about 200 years.
The tree and shrub hedges, up to five metres wide, are "forest replacements" and the last retreats for many animals and plants.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered habitats, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the Nature Conservation Association Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were built on the orders of Christian VI, the king of Denmark, in 1766, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limits and fences, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also dates back to that time: The dense, intertwined boundaries could develop by "turning" the branches.
Today, some 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North and Baltic Seas and give the picture of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by some 7000 animal species as a substitute habitat.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometer of Knick and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the Knick can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise, he is losing to a light tree row, which loses besides biodiversity also the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, kinking may only be carried out outside the breeding season from October to March.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about local situation
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you there yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta at the time on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Also our office of "World Vision" is destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have run on surrounding hills where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some people stay in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people steal some food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison was also destroyed, some of the prisoners walk around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There's still a lot of bodies around, a lot of people haven't been found yet and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but it didn't work before and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people, who do not know if they live or where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but, for example, at work.
The tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons, but when the clear came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami is hitting the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, lying on the Pacific ring of fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must for a long time renounce Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing the VfB Stuttgart with serious muscle injuries for a long time.
On Saturday, Aogo pulled a muscle fibre crack in the rear left thigh in the 2:1 against Werder Bremen, the Bundesliga football team announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle fracture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the following international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not provide a forecast of downtime.
A muscle bundle rupture usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber rupture usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the film festival of San Sebastián closes annually the ranks of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the songs on the cinema, one can sum up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.

On Sunday morning, the Olching fire department tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the action lasted for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - walkers at Lake Olching noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the area of the water guard station.
To help the animal, the passersby called the police and the fire brigade.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the forces again and again.
In the end she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to circle the animal and push it back ashore, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a fireman with a hearty handle.
The duck injured on the chest was then taken to the LMU Animal Clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But, according to the initial estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI Turbotempo Investigation
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
With a turbo-tempo FBI investigation, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the thin majority for the judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was disputed over coercion charges.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents that have occurred more than 30 years ago.
The most recent turning point in the drama about Kavanaugh's vocation, accompanied by a cultural struggle, had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing with Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the lawyer ran angry Tirades against the opposition democrats, the Senate Justice Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared, contrary to his initial announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had called the heavy preliminaries on Thursday "beschiss", initially abstained from further attacks against the women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in misfortune".
In this way, the last doubts could be removed, he said.
Later, Trump strongly attacked the Democrats in an election rally because they reject Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy".
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
Also, the White House has extremely limited the powers of investigators.
One would investigate the well-known accusations of two women, no more, said a government representative to the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried for monitoring the speed limit will be stationed on Gartenstraße from Monday, 1 October.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: The fear was felt
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home match against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room," said Schalke 04's sports board - and breathed up.
After all, the Königsblauen were still able to bring the close 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first win of the season under control.
In fact, things could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11. had given security to the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playfully and from pressing", Tedesco obviously played more and more with the playing time.
Don't really make a headball monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands, so they kept retreating.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"Everyone has fallen a huge stone from their hearts," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hit: "I'm actually the worst headball player in the man-made."
But in the end, all that matters is victory.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to get started in the initial phase and make a firework out of it," said Schalke's chief coach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to play games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest drawback of the afternoon: royal blue missed it, rather for clearer conditions to worry.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have been a trembling victory," said Tedesco: "You have already felt the fear a little bit."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only shawl with that.
Fischbachau: smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke wasn't to be missed.
From around two kilometres away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire on Sunday around 1.30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause was soon discovered by the police and the fire brigade: an unknown person had set fire to garbage on a two-square-meter surface at Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it seemed that he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the fire unattended.
And that's near the forest.
30 Fischbachauer firefighters were busy pulling out and deleting.
The police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild for the second time.
"I have made it my task for many years to bring interesting people to Greven", explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic intelligibly.
With a lot of gestures, tangible figures and one or the other joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most controversial topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts growing despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at one table, first-generation migrants at the Katzentisch.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to come to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflict.
The decisive factor is therefore not whether one is politically right-wing or left-wing, but: "Am I for or against an open society?", he emphasizes.
At first rather restrained, then more and more lively starts the discussion round.
And there's a need to talk.
From his perspective, an Afghan refugee reports that two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani is standing in front, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is on eye level.
The sociology professor does not push his opinion, stresses that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing session, he also had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities, was intensively discussed further.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win opening games
The Giessen 46ers and Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first match day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away win.
Gießen won in a hard-fought match in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won 86:79 (49:47) at the BG Göttingen.
After the 112:55-Gala on Saturday against Science City Jena, Alba Berlin is the first league leader of the season.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champions Bayern Munich and the former serial champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich already struggled on Friday for an 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80 on Saturday.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the plots in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots in the new Landsham-Süd area on the free market.
That's what Mayor Roland Frick says.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 plots of land offered by the municipality at more favourable conditions or prices, similar to the former local model, has been completed.
A good 100 applications were received, says Frick.
"Currently the documents are checked", with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the Mayor of Pliening, the goal is to have the candidate ranking list for the 20 plots drawn up by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
The award could then be made.
A total of 50 plots for single and double houses are being created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family houses with an estimated eight residential units each.
The development is now almost complete and the roads and roads will soon be paved.
A single plot as well as two of the multifamily houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in a socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented dwellings supported by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated is the area of the new Landsham-Süd area which provides housing for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start is there for the construction of a day care centre.
It will accommodate three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multipurpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
Thus Schalke's Naldo "great sport" succeeds also on the bench
Not in the starting team for the third time in a row: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not sat in the Schalker starting team for the third time in a row, but on the replacement bench, the understanding would have been great with many people, if the almost two meter tall Brazilian had really talked about the frustration of the soul.
But as the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1-0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco to all his pros, the 36-year-old, whom all simply call Naldo, came in and said, "We have to thank coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who had no grudge despite his renewed reservist existence.
It seems that Naldo, who was celebrated last season as the best Schalker, knows that he did not really fall on the siding with his coach - but for good reasons he gets a break.
A reason called "burden control."
It wasn't easy to tell him.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'll tell you that in all honesty," Tedesco reported from the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the starting team.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedesco explained the step.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everyone can take a breath right now.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation that last caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself to be an exemplary team player on the bench.
The mood in Austria's industry continued to accelerate in August compared to the eurozone.
The purchasing manager index (PMI) was at a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
Nevertheless, Austria still has the third-best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands in Europe, the Markit Institute reported on Monday on its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, which means that the index is still below the 50-point mark for the 13th consecutive month, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry broke this threshold with 50.9 points in August.
The final result was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level since March with 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened descent could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, industry remains number one in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell as strongly as since November 2011.
The companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also declined more strongly in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing manager index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in turnover, employment, stocks and prices are being raised.
Tuchels PSG team succeeds eighth victory in the eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel hurries with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship further from victory to victory.
In the OGC Nice the defending champion won 3–0 (1:0) thanks to two hits from Superstar Neymar and was thus also successful in the eighth league game.
Most recently, in France, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start into the season 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and produced the final score in the postseason.
==References====External links==* Official website
Paris was also able to pass the dress rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the season, Tuchel's team had to accept the only compulsion defeat this season at the 2:3 in Liverpool.
