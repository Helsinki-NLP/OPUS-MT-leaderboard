What should it do, the Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "confectionery".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has "knocked" members of the new council from the ČSSD a little, as they dominate the notorious slang, which has become naturalized in recent years, in which today's coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The coded vocabulary introduced by the Prague political elite in the past era by Mayor Pavel Bém is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils showed something in the dark with regard to which these new terms are based.
At least that's what they say.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I'm more of a newcomer to Prague politics," responded Lukáš Kaucký, the new Councillor for Culture, to the test of the "Paten vocabulary".
But also the Councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "golf hole".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here, which I use every now and then."
"Otherwise, I don't think much of Slang."
From the vocabulary published by the Tageblatt Aktuálně.cz in this June before the ODS election congress, the editors picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", "go to the pastry shop", "cracker", "tradition of the capital" and "bleach".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised his participation in the conversation first, but then did not even take the listener off.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and how the civil democrats talk to each other, I don't judge that."
"For me, it is important to understand how we understand each other within the framework of our programmes," he countered.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký allegedly did not recognize in the above-mentioned headline that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek, is mentioned.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all to Kaucky and the only term he correctly guessed during the test was "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, but added to the safety: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And jokingly: "I will probably have to take a language course."
The "golf hole" is then correctly deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Councillor for environmental issues Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even suspects where this figure can be found and thus what it means to "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that means going to some Prague restaurant", Plachý is pretty close to the puzzle solution when you know that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he affirms that he had drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary was his own.
According to the test participants, there really does not seem to be a similar naturalized slang among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is really no such thing with us."
"We call ourselves by name, sometimes we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of Prague's ČSSD Petr Hulínský - called "Hulda" by his party comrades.
"At school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz tried the name and see there - it works.
Ratsherr Weinert is friendly to the party comrades the "opa" or less friendly the "old one", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections through machinations in the party sponsoring, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are thus the only thing that the Social Democrats allow in the internal party language.
Hulínský supposedly doesn't like to be called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz also registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Gummistick Rights" is said to be related to Petr Hulínský's acquisition of his title Doctor juris at Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and published a brochure
Women who are labeled witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They belong more to the older generation, they do not find work - for example for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
When one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women are spared this, as they help with their work and give birth to children," a nun describes the situation that in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso takes care of more than one hundred women expelled from their communities in a special home.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, he published a brochure designed to stop "witch tracking".
There's a catch to this.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "DerStandard" pointed to the dilemma of written education.
But to be accused of witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured oil on her and simply set her on fire.
This incident was also reported by the BBC server.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the matter had only been a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to her version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual anointings.
And this after the group tried to "pull an evil spirit" out of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports the people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Feathers of human souls are a danger in the past as they are today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, last year the President of Gambia joined the president.
"President Yahya Jammeh started a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, since they allegedly had a share in their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To this end, he called for help from Shamans from nearby Guinea, who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the president's personal guards, forcibly abducted women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the President's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in its report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink an absud of plants with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the detained people did not survive their stay on the farm.
It was only due to international pressure that almost a thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - still pays higher rent
An older embroidered man is leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a portfolio with three new leases to three apartments: for his own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who is serving a prison sentence.
All three have just been increased in the context of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rent, the son is expected to rap 4100 kroner next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category.
"And there's not even hot water running in the apartment and you have to heat it in a simple coal oven," he points his finger at the son's new lease, to which he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed it," he explains half out of tune and half resigned.
The citizens' association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new lease conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December, when they intend to publish a guide on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man's just waving.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a major "deregulatory laboratory".
After New Year, this deregulation is facing most of the rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not yet pay a market-oriented rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Hav.ov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine o'clock in the morning this Tuesday is full.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a call device.
"Rent 2011", a special touch field lights up on the touch screen.
Briefly tapped and already the device spits out a number sheet.
Hardly have we deciphered the number "157" and already it beeps on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room does not seem to apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November onwards, in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new leases will float into the mailboxes of most tenants of the total of 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio.
The RPG Byty proposes a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letters.
The special counter for new rentals in the client center has been open since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it's just the beginning," the ladies answer behind the counter after a moment of hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners' homes are a hot topic.
Before the elections, the vice-president of parliament Lubomír Zaorálek from Ostrava had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"For twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"They were not even able to change toilet glasses," the man mentioned at the beginning aired.
Until now, according to the employees, pensioners in particular are standing at the counter to see if they really receive the promised rent reduction, which RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants, who sign the new lease until 15 December, will also benefit from a half-reduced February rent.
So far, "deregulatory switch" is anything but overloaded by demands in Hav
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 were here because of," the counter officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both its websites and wall panels, where it seems necessary.
However, if the rental parties fail to agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on his websites.
"No one goes to court here," says one of RPG Byty's employees, and a man on the street in front of the client center at least partially agrees with her.
"I have 13,000 (crown) pensions, of which I have 5,000 for food, where should I get the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them not to sign through the media, so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic for New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rents is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, director of the housing portfolio of RPG Byty and - in the opinion of the homeowners, the main reason for the rent increase is precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticised by the upset tenants.
While between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest four billion from the rents received in the apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Hav
"The rental increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"This always means a maximum of CZK 7,50 per square metre per month", can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from RPG's portfolio increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it's about increasing extremely low rental prices of CZK 19,66 per square metre," RPG argues.
With 2600 apartments the rent remains the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not drive rents skyrocket, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes a further obligation: All revenues from the rental increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - into new windows and into thermal insulation.
But - above all, these should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the employees of Arch.Design since last year.
Arch.Design, the design and architecture firm from which a whole series of renowned Brno buildings originate, calculated the premises for its company mini-kindergarten from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint.
In wise foresight, because most of his 90 employees are in the Babyboom age and the company is interested in the project designers returning to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work in a shorter way, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer to its employees in the concept of their social program.
This makes it easier for the civil engineers to reconcile their demanding profession and child care.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The mini-kindergarten is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operational Programme from the European Social Fund and the Czech Republic State Budget.
Thanks to this financing (contributions of CZK 2, 8 million) the necessary facilities and equipment could be procured and for a period of 2 years qualified personnel and operation is provided.
After 2 years of funding, Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the Minikindergarten for 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the Economy Rating company providing active assistance in the implementation of the application.
The children are taken care of by fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is about a mini kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day alternates over several children.
The kindergarten business is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the supporting programme of pre-school education.
The children not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, while also learning English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to children.
What's more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus the stress is eliminated when the children are picked up late from a distant kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also emerging here.
Arch.Design thus joined the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personnel marketing through such programs.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Check out the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn-up fish mouths.
This is Casa Batlló by Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants the house with its organic forms got the nickname "Knobenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, the shed-like facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The façade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and living beings.
It is only when you take a closer look that you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thought-out order.
At night, the whole façade looks even more plastic, dramatic and the special illumination enhances the shine of the colours.
The same sweeping lines and entwined forms also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-like shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even peepholes and strips.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was built by the reconstruction of a house dating from 1877, carried out by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end he agreed with Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper conversion.
However, Antoni Gaudí did not design the Casa Batlló apartment house alone.
He collaborated with architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner and the use of mosaics on the façade were his idea, especially on its drawing board.
However, numerous other painters and artists also worked on the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá in Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was nicknamed "Knobenhaus" by the local inhabitants of its organic forms.
Others called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "cheering house".
It is also said that the sword of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia, is depicted at the top of the building.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a central heating system for the house, which was unique at the time, with ventilation ducts and typical fireplaces.
It's a bit bizarre, her 45-degree inclination already seems.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations at the time and did not allow himself to be deceived by them.
Before construction began, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later the city fathers were so horrified at the completion that they demanded remedy.
Among other things, the councillors also came up against the fact that the building with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, changes were no longer made, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the city's request to do so, Josep Batlló submitted an application to allow the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor was a social salon, on the third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
By the basic elements of the conversion all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and so a larger society could chat comfortably, without having to renounce a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
In addition to a new façade, the house received a rather unusual roof and two more floors.
Gaudí's play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is covered and the courtyards are impressive.
The play of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
In doing so, he simply used the principle that white reflects light better than dark colours, which absorb sunlight on the contrary.
Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, is open to everyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is open to the public.
Only in the year did the homeowners decide on this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was discovered that this is a fairly profitable business, the visits were kept, yes, they were extended to other common and attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the monument is not a cardboard handle, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the house dwellers and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have different wishes than men
Not the greatest bed frame, but the quality of the bed surface - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
In the selection many things play a role - the weight, the size, the health condition and last but not least also the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior, in which mattress and rust have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend home where there is no regular heating, latex mattresses are not well suited as they take much longer to become "warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough vents in the core and are also lying on a solid plate, moisture incites itself: it is therefore not impossible that mold forms under them.
Of course, what you are used to also plays a role in the election.
Anyone who has been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will be hard to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Well, all the hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here anymore."
"For their worn-out shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"Among other things, I recommend these to diabetic people who suffer from a nervous system disorder, so that they cannot receive the "information" from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why years ago I bought many ice hockey players, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer among others the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it literally hugs the warm body.
Nowhere does it push, in the night you do not roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (wound fire).
When choosing the mattress size one should still add the length of the soles to the body height, i.e. approx.21 to 34 cm.
Man and woman, who are 180 cm tall, need such a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each sleeper should have at least 90 cm lying width available, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For convenience and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal width of the bed: "If you are lying on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms," advises Helena Prokopová, the guild master of upholstery and interior decorators, who has been dedicated to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for years and who also presents this topic to technical schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, there is no other option than to mount the grates at different heights and this is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should be removed from the mould layer and the fine cushion.
"You can't feel the feathers with your hand or when you sit down," Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and underlay such as co-grown Siamese twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be aired and the cover cannot be washed, which is already common today.
And since one loses between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged sieve).
For this reason, too, experts reject advertising slogans that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even a lifetime guarantee for mattresses.
Every thing has its ifs and buts.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: With mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width one should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, nevertheless it is recommended to use a mattress protector, which one can easily remove and wash.
Even if today, mattress covers are usually made with all-around zippers, so that you get two halves after opening (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially executed alone, often seems like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get it out!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should rather provide the plate with ventilation holes (if there are none) and use mattresses with spring skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called pocket spring core and fine padding.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a base.
For non-adjustable slatted grates with 14 to 18 slats, latex or sandwich mattresses (including combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable.Rots with a larger number of slats, i.e. 28 and more, are always paid for, with lumbar support in the lumbar vertebra area and the possibility to regulate the slat hardness.
On adjustable slat gratings no mattresses with spring skeleton belong, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special attachment of the spring strips, which allows the spring strips to be pressed or even angled so that they allow the shoulder of the sleeper to sink in spot.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
Point elastic wing spring systems (lattoflex) or rusts with point elastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsion suspension are intended for the most demanding customers.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and bulky) pillow to get the right mattress and the right rust, most of the benefits are lost.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow seems ideal, as the Scandinavians like it, for example.
In the side position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former straw sacks (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their admixtures.
The new magic word "bio" is also used for mattresses.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils are increasingly used for the production of polyurethane foams - for example castor oil and soya oil.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is the name for mattresses, which are made of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Va­ek from Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
However, you can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scents while sleeping.
Here, too, one makes a difference between man and woman.
While men use a "cooling" plant extract made from birch leaves to absorb the heat and cool the body, women's covers have a "warming" effect.
Extracts of red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets warm while sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and Visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hip and heel are.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to rap.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to lower VAT, as they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
You see, saving on the mattress and rust is not so easy.
Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the brand Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze with visco foam memory for CZK 11,990.
You get the second one for free.
It was the material tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the start.
Tempur becomes soft with heat, in a cool environment it solidifies again.
In this way, it adapts perfectly to the human body and optimally distributes the body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burns, but generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are not only used for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to facilitate the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to control the kids
The fear for their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented for the search for cars, can locate people just as well, which would also be helpful in such cases, as recently when nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared without a trace.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box but soon it should not be bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have been frightened by the disappearance of Anička, so they are looking for ways and means to better protect their children.
Also for the price of compromising their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying around, but about an effective way to reduce the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that there can be abuse of such devices in individual cases, for example when you put it in someone's pocket without knowing about it, but we have not had such a case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn't like to wear such a thing, he or she simply gets rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things when they don't want to be controlled."
"In the beginning, the mobile phones already raised great expectations among parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new monitoring devices," says Ms Bočková.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution will actually help in the event of an attack.
"In planned kidnappings, the kidnapper virtually always checks whether the child has any electronics with him or her that could be used to locate it."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, she admits that similar devices can be helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both automobiles and persons, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted so that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"With more expensive devices, even a tilt meter is integrated, that is, if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," Mr. Čech claims.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, one only needs to install a special software.
The problem with the current tracking devices is that they are either matchbox-sized devices similar to trailers or smaller mobile phones.
There's always a danger of losing them.
According to Mr Pilin from Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital watches are being tested in the present.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or tracking device.
"Or he only notices after some time what gives the police a time advantage," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - towards bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used, as in vehicle tracking.
So the combination of the tracking function using the GPS system (just like the GPS in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many fuses that you could wrap all of the Czech Republic but only hold you for two years
The Czech Army has bought 445 kilometers of ignition cords to be ignited with explosive devices.
The previous year, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cords - two, but at most four years.
The army bought the ignition cord from the stock company STV Group, a. s. for läppische 40 million kroner.
In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this enormous amount of ignition cord, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume 60 kilometers of ignition cord annually.
According to research by army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES referred to, this statement indicates that the entire army would have to undergo extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from generals and officers of the Army Command to secretaries and cleaning women.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres of ignition cords be partially justified.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts is still valid that to train every new professional soldier two meters of ignition cord is sufficient, then the army has created a calming supply for the already mentioned 225 years through these new purchases - also from the point of view of the increased need of the pioneer and special units.
In the process, soldiers from the Rapid Operations Brigade recently complained to Defence Minister Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so that shooting exercises of the missing funds are severely restricted.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't understand why they buy so many fuses from us."
But that's ultimately their decision, they'll know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer, to whom we as dealers would like to approach as much as possible", says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, explains the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of fuses, so that the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, however, only speaks of a four-year service life of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnicians only of two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are also possible," admits one of them, but he wants to remain unnamed in order not to be accused of criticizing the army as a soldier.
At the end of the service life, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of the soldiers.
But these tests are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the volume discount for the 445 kilometers of ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometres," spokesman Pejšek tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of ignition cords by police pyrotechnicians who liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherhood has for some years now barely exceeded 1,500 meters.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition, which they can consume before the end of the service life.
Because of the safety of pyrotechnicians, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore reliable ignition cords is also kept open.
The Ministry of Defence has huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand Czechoslovak People's Army prepared for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians who referred to MF DNES, the Czech armed forces are expecting the same problem in a few years' time with the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old ignition cords, which they have bought so "favourably" today.
To date, I have enjoyed the contacts I have gained thanks to the competition.
Lukáš Pytloun won the "Small Business of the Year" competition and helped sell the franchise of his hotel.
Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec was the winner of the last year of the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition.
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that there was a lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings from his holiday work abroad and with a bank loan, he bought a dilapidated house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a sixth - semester college student at the time, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit back in the house, which he subsequently converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four guest houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of more than 300 beds of all accommodation categories in Liberec in just seven years.
Until recently, the most comfortable of them was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
Another first-class hotel was added this year.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the franchise of Pytloun hotels have already registered," says the entrepreneur number one last year.
"Great share in this license sale to run hotels just had the victory in the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition," Mr. Pytloun adds appreciatively.
The victory has brought him greater fame, even popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, they often even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say, that was really good," he remembers.
I really recommend to all those who want to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win right away, any visualization is good.
He says that he still benefits from the contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have happened at all.
"With some people I have met thanks to the competition, I maintain regular business relationships to this day."
In his opinion, the fame associated with success also reflects a little on each of his employees.
And there he has to the seventy.
"I notice greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that is given general recognition."
I really don't see this just as a personal success, no, that's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name has only moved a little to the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year when we had it in Farmet
Victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind him.
The prize for the first place of the competition Vodafone Company of the Year in the past year was received by Karel
At the time, the jury praised the efforts with which he stomped a company out of the ground from small toolmaking in Česká Skalice, which generated hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encouraged myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's company history was the effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered a small workshop for rent to his father Karel Rský as compensation for the property confiscated by the communists, he did not hesitate long, left his career in the company in which he was employed until then, and founded his own company for the production of plastic tubs with a few of his father's comrades.
A short time later, they began to concentrate on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But it was only through success in the aforementioned competition and its medialization that it also became aware of the non-specialist public.
"Not only did our customers notice the Farmet brand much more intensively, our foreign partners also began to work together with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country in attaching greater value to it," says Karel
The past year, however, was not only about victory euphoria at Farmet.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of toolmaking products.
The crisis, which at that time shook even less the citizens, but above all companies, reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and limit the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we couldn't escape this situation either."
"Sales decreased by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even resort to layoffs," says Karel Rský.
A viable company sometimes needs to take such unpopular measures.
But it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black numbers, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was unwilling to make cuts - in terms of investment in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre from the grant, strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and obtained major prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Mr. Rský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in victory - but in a calmer atmosphere", says Karel Rský.
An opinion poll that cleans up with crazy regulations
The "Absurdity of the Year" opinion poll is part of the business competition for the fourth time.
Some senseless regulations have already managed to get out of the world.
The dubious winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" became the duty to create documents on authorities that are available online.
For example, more than a third of less than four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the social security administration requested a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
This is now changing thanks to the opinion poll.
"In future, the Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the commercial register for checks on social security payers," said the spokesperson of ČSSZ Jana Buraňová.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all regulations and orders that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to fulfil and to lift the nonsense.
This is the fourth time this year that it has been part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the tsch. Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) and is enjoying increasing public popularity.
When the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder business activity.
"For example, as far as the number of income tax forms is concerned, we take a leading position in the world," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurship has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of company conditions, with an eight-ranking ranking lower than in the previous year.
The competition Absurdity of the Year was first announced in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the end of September.
The website www.firmaroku.cz is used to register. After that, the organiser of the competition selects seven candidates for the "Antipreis" and lets the public vote on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz via the Internet.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105 senseless regulations and orders have already been filed for this year's opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, regulations that maintenance vehicles for motorways and expressways have to pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to prepare every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition at the beginning of November at Prague's Wenceslas Square is part of a happening in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic were present at the highlight of the competition.
"Where the state throws stick between the entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic upswing, therefore it is my aim to abolish every year at least thirty paragraphs, which still make their enterprises unnecessarily difficult for the entrepreneurs today", said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create nonsensical arrangements out of the world are effective.
In 2007, people were most disturbed by the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to report to the Trade Office at the location of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention to go to an exhibition or fair with an exhibition stand.
This obligation was abolished by an amendment to the Trade Act.
The obligation, which in 2007 received the second largest number of votes - the obligation to report to the employment office missions of employees up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "green card".
And - all good things are three:
On the absurdity of the year 2009, the decree was chosen, which ordered physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the speech room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the obligation to refrigerate fell away.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote sound and fair undertakings.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the impact of their business activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of Vodafon, the promoter and guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebel of the Year" competition.
For this year's first year of this special sub-category of the main competition Vodafon Company of the Year, companies for which success is not the only long-term goal have registered.
The story of each of them is highly inspirational and provides enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the subject matter of their activity, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This concerns, for example, people who are hacked, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, was the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for gehandicapte children for seventeen years.
A paper mill from Poděbrady also provides exemplary care for its disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemia Region"; in the competition Vodafone Company of the Year, it ranked third in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting company MiRyz Soft won, among other things, a running and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without any relative wage reduction.
During the award ceremony, the jury also honoured the fact that the company mainly purchases from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in its surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the impact of our business activities and administration on the environment," explains Miluše Ryznarová, Managing Director.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region, on the other hand, is concerned with the health of its employees and therefore it has purchased ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, it also promotes home work among its employees and, in corporate activities, it uses Cartering services offered by a home-protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the foundation "People in need", which provides concrete help to the local Roma community", says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to their employees' pension insurance in the form of extra bonuses, is also worth mentioning.
"We provide our employees with contributions to food, work, increase their qualifications and holidays," says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch in Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
To the category Responsible company of the year all district finalists of the competition Vodafon company of the year were automatically registered, which answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the registration and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Wrong or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsible Company of the Year", but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year they were not disqualified."
"A separate registration only for this competition is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year", explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests of the police in a public tender
In the building of the Soil Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have been making arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was handcuffed by the detectives.
The latter allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition currently taking place for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition fell to a specific interested party.
He is said to have paid Luboš G. half a million.
"At this time, I can only confirm that the police are persecuting a person for the crime of fraudulent conduct in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsner Procuratorate of the "Právo" newspaper, who could not provide further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
The way in which he was able to manipulate public competition can only be speculated about in view of the scanty official information.
The spokesperson of the Soil Fund Lubomír Černá referred to the question raised by Právo in this regard, namely that the police had actually arrested the ground fund in the Pilsner branch of the Soil Fund, during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she concretized.
According to Ms Černá, public competition had the correct name "Call for bids for land transfer rights under the Land Law" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the land offered.
"As part of the invitation, these persons offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared property value."
"According to the claims offered, the order of potential purchasers is determined, then the ground fund transfers the land to the person with the highest offer," explains the fund's spokesperson.
Luboš G. obviously had information at his disposal about who had registered at the request and because he himself was a legitimate person, having bought a number of restitution claims, he offered a real estate interest that he would withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat severance pay.
That would also be a sufficient explanation of why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had already had too good contacts with the Pilsner Soil Fund in the past.
For example, he also played a role in the causa of the former head of the Václav Sankota Soil Fund, which was prosecuted because he issued land in replacement restitutions that had already been decided on site for construction projects.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. also purchased land from the Land Fund intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, on the site where the construction of the access highway to the Borské Pole industrial estate was planned.
Later he exchanged them very cheaply with the magistrate for a house directly in the historical center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
At that time, the town hall had to give small parts of its heart in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs rise by several hundred per month
From January onwards, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and wastewater charges, and for district heating and, in some places, rents will also grow.
As of January, families will have to pull several hundred kroner a month more out of their wallet than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places you will also increase the cost of district heating.
Electricity consumption alone costs the housing budgets a few hundred kroner a year.
The high electricity prices have been reduced by all the main suppliers, which is the reason for the significant promotion of electricity production from renewable sources, especially from photovoltaic plants.
Gas is only moderately more expensive, but this is exactly when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, a few hundred more crowns are to be expected per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, district heating prices vary from city to city.
In particular, larger locations are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 kroner per month from January for district heating, and families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 kroner per year.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, are threatened by 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges, in case the city increases its infrastructure rent.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In the North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Enormous increases in rental prices are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation will be abolished from January onwards.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January onwards.
Anyone who does not agree with this rent increase wants to be prosecuted by the company.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in approximately 300,000 apartments today, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech kids get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Farnet, rum and vodka, for once also a good whisky, which was stolen from the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks, after which drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen must be treated most frequently.
No exception are children who repeatedly have to sleep their hangover in the hospital.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of children's departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief physician of the Children's Department at the Central Bohemian Hospital Hořovice.
"Whisky, if the father succeeds in taking a bottle from the house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or Vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief physician.
The spokesperson of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová agrees with him.
"The most common thing is about Fernet or rum."
"This is the current alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, which you take away from home," said Ms. Jurinová.
According to chief physician Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers have long been no exception in hospital admission.
In front of the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatric department of Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunk pupils from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She began her career at the age of 12 when she was first admitted with 3.5 per mille of alcohol in her blood and in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at some dance party at the exhibition grounds in Holešovice."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief physician wonders.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in stumbling with their own offspring that is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, there is no real dependence on children in the true sense of the word.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol, including all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains chief physician Pelikán.
According to the spokesperson for Motol Hospital, Ms. Jurinová, about forty drunk children were admitted to the local Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine by mid-November.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children brought home after outpatient treatment by their parents or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children only drink a bottle of booze in the school bench, Mr. Pelikán believes that there are three seasonal amplitudes that are 100% reliable: Walpurgis Night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either for grief because of the bad testimony or for pleasure in the holidays."
"On Walpurgis Night, I also experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording," Dr. Pelikán emphasizes.
Paradoxically, a drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is better off than a child who only has to fight with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headaches in the morning after that, caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be eliminated in the hospital with a fluid - feeding infusion of glucose and nutrients that the organism lacks.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "glorious" experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without hurting anything anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," Dr. Pelikán admits, sometimes spoiling the patient's mood by at least giving them the cost of the treatment.
Because the transport with the ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly on a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"I used this as a means of education once and for all when I directly pre-calculated the children during the visit, which cost them their drunkenness and that it can happen that they have to work all the time to earn the money for one such party," Dr. Pelikán added.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to recourse procedures in order to claim the costs necessary to cure the drunken children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence has replaced against the transport plane Casa C-295M, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that this type of machine has been owned by a foreign army.
They were only seen abroad during maneuvers or flight shows.
It is about the two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are currently still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken them over last week.
Jan Pejšek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known when she physically exports the aircraft from Vodochody.
The L-159 single-seat fighter aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from long-term storage aircraft without further deposits and investments from the ministry's department.
"The double-seat L-159T1 were replaced in current condition and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to survive without two-seat fighter aircraft, as the Ministry of Defense signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four redundant L-159 to a two-seat version.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second will take over it by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has undertaken to enforce the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the customer of aircraft L-159 and that they are intended to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the customer to see how he realises the matter," Pejšek said.
The business paper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
Last year, the government of Mirek Topolánek approved the exchange of five L-159 for a transport plane Casa and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not tendered for procurement, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Defense Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought from Aero 72 machines, of which it only uses 24, the rest it wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa aircraft should also have a judicial follow-up.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice. The reason? It should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three planes, Casa, and the last is scheduled to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at less risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is supposed to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty," explained co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, added Ms. Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants of the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the probability of prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of men whose ring and index fingers were the same.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which already form at prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone in particular accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told ČTK that he was familiar with this study, but he did not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be "completely proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a blanket of snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks there is mostly frozen snow, the winter servants were on the road all night long in many places.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague "stands".
This is what Novinky.CZ of the dispatchers of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK) said.
At kilometer 91, a truck crashed, at kilometer 93 two trucks collided, in this accident there are injured.
A few cars are also in the ditch.
There are also problems at km 185 on the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here, too, two trucks collided.
The drivers should leave immediately behind Brno at km 190 or drive over Brno and drive at km 182 at the village of Kývalka.
There are miles of traffic jams.
An accident happened on the D11 as well, just at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself lies a snow cover several centimetres thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, motorcades form in Prosek, and the Štěrboholská road is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis unit meets.
There are also problems with the railway and at the airfield.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven fast train connections due to snow drifts.
There are problems, for example, on the Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun route.
Travelers should be sure to find out about the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport has been closed from 11 a.m. to 5 a.m. since Wednesday.
Most roads in South Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
Around Vyškov three side roads are completely unaccessable, in the area around Brno there are snowdrifts in places and in the area around Blansko one is forced to use snow cutters on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is V’skov.
Three roads are still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, you will have to use snow cutters to clear snow.
Until now, it is not possible to estimate when they will be able to be used again.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
ČTK pointed out that there is a snow cover up to five centimetres thick on the roads, which can only be scattered with inert scattering agents for reasons of nature conservation.
In the Czech Republic, two to ten centimetres of fresh snow fell, most of them in northern Bohemia - in places up to 18 centimetres.
Up to 15 centimetres of fresh snow fell in the Moravian-Silesian region.
But in the Czech Republic it stops snowing slowly.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon".
The American troops have for the first time deployed a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, which is so far known only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-precise cannon.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a accuracy of only a few meters.
The special bullets of calibre 25 mm, which were developed for this rifle and contain highly explosive explosives, function practically like small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed so that they can explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
That means you can use them against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put it out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technologies.
"The soldier basically does this: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact point of sight, after which he corrects the angle of elevation, then he only needs to pull the trigger.
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the gun charges and shoots the bullet at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu Group is moving its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their jobs from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specializing in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, 400 women and men will move their jobs from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park in July next year, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokesperson for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term there should be a further 100 jobs for the Group, which were previously distributed among the region.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, and the offices in the Astro Park were better suited to the working methods of the employees.
Fujitsu had also been only a tenant in Bad Homburg.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said "with Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezernent Markus Frank (CDU) said that this had once again won a "Global Player".
This is a "great site statement".
Fujitsu adapts to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
"Of course, we offered the company our help," said Korwisi.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed anything about the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been decisive.
Now it is a matter of preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is cooperative."
The house at Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale", which was previously used by Fujitsu, were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa town, together with the remaining buildings at Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new urban centre was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive construction of the previously partly used parking space and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still connected to Siemens, moved into the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu computer is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has much more employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions moves into Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location are said to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped floor plan - the Central Association of Electrical and Electronic Industries has its headquarters.
Amazon locks server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is becoming increasingly distressed.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banished the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps this is the result of political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
Wikileaks founder Assange is supposed to be in England.
The unveiling platform Wikileaks is increasingly under fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
However, prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's search lists, is supposed to be in the UK according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks displaced from Amazon servers."
"Free Speech in the Land of the Free", the disclosure activists announced via Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banished Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic dispatches in order to cope with the high number of access to the documents.
Via Twitter Wikileaks went on to say: "Excellent - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman did research, reports CNN, citing the Liebermans office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman called for the platform to be prevented from being used on servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileak's illegal, monstrous, and ruthless approach puts our national security at risk and endangers life around the globe," said a report by the partyless senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in their efforts to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted for rape by the authorities in Sweden, is on the search list of Interpol.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian resides in the UK, the exact location is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigation in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls for an assassination of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is afraid for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore remain hidden.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, an advisor to head of government Stephen Harper - apparently ironic - said on TV that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Meanwhile, the White House and Assange were being replaced.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recent espionage requests to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website."
The US government is now fully testing the protection of its databases.
The White House announced that Russell Travers, Vice-Director of the Center for Anti-Terrorism Action, had been appointed as the Special Representative.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that had become necessary after the publication of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to check the ways in which the entire government is exchanging and protecting information.
The U.S. government also announced its intention to ensure the security of dissidents and activists should they be threatened by the Wikileaks release.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We stand ready to protect them if necessary."
The Ice University
At the Gelato University near Bologna, ice-confectioners are being prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
The Gelataio and the Gelataio.
The gelater, in German somewhat ancient the ice-confectioner, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making.
The Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the ice cream counter with a spatula, strokes it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice, you can't get past the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003, so that the ice cream from its machines everywhere meets the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
There are also several-day special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream parlor.
Some dream of a new career in the mid-life crisis, others just venture onto the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to bag something of her own after years in a nerve-racking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlour in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive factor is not only good taste, but also silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget the icing on the cake of the national and even southern superstructure during his training: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step towards production seems quite simple.
Luciano dumps the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns up a cock on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the lecturer is attacked with questions: Can ice cream only be produced with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one let free run of one's own desire to experiment?
Luciano warns against being misled by the zeitgeist.
Anyone who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar gum from the guarbean.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, but then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it will sag in itself, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Certain variations on the base mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice cream Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn on dozens of flavored additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base mass, which turns with eggs into yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano makes them produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
The fruit ice varieties are also subjected to the same experiment.
More flavors, more fruit puree - this is not necessarily better in taste.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste nutty if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is produced by the working group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture really enhances the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice production is a calculation task: If peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano pulls out a device by which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (wincers measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make computing easier.
Making ice doesn't require as much physical effort as it used to.
Not only the device helps for the automatic production of the basic mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is simultaneously creamy beaten and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all automation, small breakdowns do not remain.
The Brazilian Gustavo grapples himself and his classmates with fruit puree from top to bottom when he gets out of control of the oversized staff mixer.
"In every class," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time before something like this happens."
Checkers in twilight
The European Food Authority Efsa is undermining the industry experimenting with gene plants.
The expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology, now formulates this accusation.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then in Munich on Wednesday.
Harry Kuiper, head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the Ilsi lobbyist association for years.
This is paid for by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper had played a significant role in the Efsa test regulations for gene plants and was therefore in a clear conflict of interest, criticized Then.
The Efsa rules are word-by-word identical to Ilsi's position papers, thus deceiving the handwriting of the industry, which is supposed to be controlled by the Italian Parma authorities.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech has committed a conflict of interests.
For example, a high-ranking Efsa manager recently became the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta without any conditions or transitional period - and thus changed sides.
The Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) had also recently revealed personnel links between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby, which the Federal Environment Agency and EU parliamentarians have made clear.
However, Efsa cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
One could refer to all serious data, including those of industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, according to a statement.
The experts who work for Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But you would have to disclose them.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
Independent experts such as Then criticise the fact that genetically modified plants are currently authorised in animals without any feeding test and that the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize does in the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you supposed to find them?"
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
As in the US, industry is now trying to influence or discredit critical scientists more and more in Europe.
There were therefore few researchers left who were not intertwined with corporations.
For companies critical studies would usually not be published.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell has also taken care of some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of the Stuttgart train station, the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: in September the excavators had moved on and had begun to break off a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar lowering of the station.
When construction stopped, much of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured some of the chunks.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't leave."
He enthuses: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, he smelled like cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the chunks.
Stones have time.
So did Uli Gsell.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought all those who were killed in the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were ground to gravel or disappeared into the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden pad that once was a guard house.
He said that he was insulted and threatened when the newspapers said in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the demolition.
And if it were to happen, then it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were to be reused.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80 kilo quadrants, an average unit price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but also in the hope of being able to return it during a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck loads.
About half of them are still in the forest, the rest is already sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer.
From everywhere they had come and towed away what trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the kick have long since turned into "mäuerle" or into limits of herb beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He climbs into his off-road vehicle, takes a tour through his 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and dropped out, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone merchant.
And stone lovers.
It stores 40000 tons of stones.
From all over Germany he gathers his treasures.
He says he's the Republic's biggest old stone dealer.
He's slowing down.
There are artfully carved sandstones in the snow.
"You once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elb sandstone, yellow, warm, he's raving.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up through the forest.
It points to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
Let's go.
"Nice Travertine."
Once the quads belonged to the grandstand of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Stones and stories all over the snow, Cannstatt Travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the Cathedral of Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen remembers how the stones were once cut by hand and moved with simple pulleys and ox carts, he becomes quite awesome.
"It would be a scandal to shred something like that."
He didn't get rich, he didn't get rich, he didn't get rich.
But 14 people are employed by the stone merchant today, besides, stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it is satisfying," says the recycler.
Soon he'll have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent battle for high potentials
There is a lively crowd at the buffet.
Sixteen students are pushing for salmon buns, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are supposed to talk about the car of the future together with VW developers - and get to know Volkswagen by the way.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies now go into close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates in the lecture halls as early as possible before they come to the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish lists of the achievements of their students, one tries to spot and bind the exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Braunschweig, the car company is promoting the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, gummy bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the company.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig supervises the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "Students get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"At the same time, VW can get to know students, look at interesting candidates and think about who would be eligible as employees."
Such cooperation, says Selle, is not unusual.
New is that the students are so offensive.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
But they have to praising themselves and especially beg for highly skilled workers.
Graduates from engineering disciplines in particular are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Verband Deutscher Ingenieure VDI, more than 40,000 engineering posts were vacant in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called engineering gap will become even bigger.
Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt for the auditing and consulting company KPMG.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt in which participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the US next year.
By the way, participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Anyone who is allowed to participate, decides in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
According to Dykta, the guns are getting bigger and bigger when the high potentials at the universities are pounding and stinging.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Only a simple sailing trip was too little for us."
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to open.
"We still have contact with all participants of a similar campaign last year."
"Some are on the verge of graduation and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct appeal on campus, especially small and medium-sized companies also go to the game in a very classic way at professional fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Approximately at the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, HR manager at the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problem of young people.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company website.
"It is very difficult to occupy vacant positions right now."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give indications that we can do internships or write your diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not popular with solar specialists.
The company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large company often cannot offer this," says HR manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the leading role in the search for a job.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for advancement are other crucial factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute prepares an annual ranking list of German employers.
To this end, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for employees.
Human resources manager Stübe hopes to gain points from the placement among job seekers.
"I think applicants look especially for external evaluations about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees," he says.
In the sector jargon, this is called internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within the company's own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would advertise for their employer all by themselves with friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
The government in Washington has imposed a ban on this - and thus definitively revokes its previous plans.
New drilling is also prohibited off the Atlantic coast for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April.
Before the disaster, which cost eleven workers their lives and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents want to reduce the US's dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who bear responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf have not yet been finally resolved.
At the centre of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is confronted with billions of dollars.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama is expected to present its findings during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, several oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tighter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe.
Currently, the competent control authority, which had been discredited after numerous allegations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the volume of production in the Gulf would be significantly lower than previously due to stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent industry survey conducted by BDO, a consulting firm, before the drilling ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows what exactly will change with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of litres of run-out crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't bother," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You'll get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the attempt to photograph a boy wading up to his chest in the water with the streaks surrounding him: in the rainbow-colored water gloss the scene seems almost pretty.
The fact that brown crude oil is floating under the surface is not visible.
She used to collect prawns here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the inert flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, huge amounts of crude oil poured into the vast wetlands from a burst pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishy waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
On the way through the mangrove swamps crossed by rivers, the whole extent of the devastation becomes obvious.
Instead of light water, the motor boat digs up brown broth, who dips his hand in the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude like black licorice sticks out of the ground, sadly isolated palm trees leave their wedel hanging.
In vain, swarms of birds, as usual in wetlands, are sought: as soon as the outboarder is silent, ghostly rest spreads in the former paradise, smelling like a gas station.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari sinisterly: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battleground that has been fought for decades: more than 60 years ago the first explorers from Europe invaded here, here in the 1980s the first resistance was organized with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell group had to stop its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
The company is still denied return to Ogoniland today: while over two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region of three times the size of Switzerland with over 5000 drill wells and 7000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken and the Group is in a position to be too unstable.
Every few hundred metres, steel frames rise out of the water like bizarre sculptures: "Christ trees" are called the heads of the boreholes much too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the mark.
Again and again such a drilling head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion liters have flowed into the delta's ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil that went into the Alaska Sea 21 years ago during the accident of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" - one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Those who are responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU are disputed about it.
While the Shell Group blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see burrowing drillheads and leaking pipelines as the main cause.
Shell set significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner accused the company in 2008: The rate of faults on the lines alone was "much higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-lubricated workshop under the open sky, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are chip-naked and oil-lubricated to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the site, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, head of the group.
First gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot, later drips kerosene at the end of the line and finally diesel out.
For example, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300 litres of diesel every day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - around 22 dollars.
Delta dwellers are using the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal stoves can still undercut the ridiculously low price of diesel with just under 40 euros cents per litre: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "Bunkers" who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: According to experts, this way the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil every day throughout the Niger Delta.
However, only a small part of the temporarily intermediated raw material is illegally refined: organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military personnel, fill the lion's share in tankers and spoil it on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate whether the environmental catastrophe is more due to the upheavals of the population or the lax mode of production to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and if they had not destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell had been so destroyed that only a deduction of the company would be possible: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese would turn out to be better."
Michael's getting nervous.
"Highest time for you to disappear," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special forces, they are not under arrest, but a painful bribe.
Like all Nigerians, the soldiers, who mainly come from the north of the country, also want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has put our country on the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators detect dangerous construction errors in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction defect during the investigation of an emergency landing machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas distressed aircraft at the beginning of November apparently had much more luck than they have known so far: The Australian aviation security authority has identified a major safety problem with the engines of some A380 aircraft during its investigation - and now warns against a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, according to a statement from the ATSB authority published this Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
Rolls-Royce produced engines in 20 A380 aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which was forced to land in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a plea in law with an Australian federal court in Sydney, allowing him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline would claim compensation for the incident in early November.
During the fire of the engine parts had dissolved and the wings damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety issue had been considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily dropped about three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa switched the engine off on an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The two-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany all in white: Snow has fallen almost all over the country overnight.
There is chaos on many roads, trains and flights fail.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter frosts Germany: In icy temperatures, almost the whole Republic is snowed towards Thursday at night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and in the east lie some 15 cm thick snow blankets.
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in continuous use, but was not able to cope with the constantly new blowing snow.
In addition, violent gusts swept over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm surges with water levels of 1.2 meters above the normal level on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein in the morning.
In Saxony, snow drifts on the motorways and federal roads led to considerable problems.
According to the Severe Weather Center Meteomedia, therefore, in Saxon Switzerland, the alert level was violet - the highest level ever.
Sometimes there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow, fresh and strong winds caused drifts.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
Snow and wind on the A2 led to heavy traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and switches are the main problems.
In Saxony the long-distance service from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Saalfeld in Thuringia, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescue workers with blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept across the streets.
At large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a spokesperson of the flight information center, a number of cancellations have already been reported.
According to a Fraport spokesperson, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers are at the airport, there are still almost 400 cots available for them.
Accidents occurred on many roads already on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train on a level crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: here, too, a truck was caught on a level crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after crossing a smooth road with her car near Aschaffenburg.
But the meteorologists still have good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will already stir up in light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is haunted by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - sometimes up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Just recently, Deutsche Bank made its corporate headquarters pretty: the twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernized; meanwhile, the bankers were allowed back to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the costs of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
The speaker did not mention reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then rent it back," he said.
This means that Germany's largest credit institution will be re-established after a short period of time.
The bank had taken over the double towers only in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund and then extensively rehabilitated.
The energy conversion devoured the data according to about 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers now renamed "Greentowers" to be around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will be resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is currently open, the spokesman said.
Thousands grieving for dead buddies
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the buried miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be recovered because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Less than two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been lowered into the accident shaft, but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies have not yet been recovered.
Now family members and friends remembered the dead with a memorial.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered in bright sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
They kept silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners there were 29 tables on which helmets, lamps and the names of the pals could be seen.
Images and personal belongings, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country the flags blew on half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth", said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants in the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude the death of his son unless he saw his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the commemoration ceremony.
The first explosion on 19 November had also spilled miners of British and South African origin.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are displaced, it will begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, Police President Gary Knowles said to journalists.
Hell, warriors!
Does Splatter fit to the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
To which audience might Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents with almost superhuman forces in rows - sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and his enemies already tear the intestines out of the living body when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, doesn't say a word about the whole film, and even the other characters can at most be carried away to one or two sentences or a few agonizing death screams.
Otherwise, silence will be silenced and shrouded in Scotland's frightful hilly landscape, which provides the backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cineas with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera drives.
It's nice if a film has several target groups, but it's only a pity if they're mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but refuses stoically to make his works accessible to the mainstream or a little less brutality to the Arthouse with a little more humor.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be deterred by the splashing brain mass and intestines.
The action fans die from boredom at the latest when one-eyes leave for Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for free interpretable reasons and are stuck in a flimsy and fog for an eternity before the crew appears to arrive in America and remain silent there.
No wonder that "Walhalla Rising" did not find a cinema rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is a pity, especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-letting facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a stringent action, it's all atmosphere, it's a fever dream that has become filmed.
And there is no escape from it for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly closes his throat with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the incomprehensible hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blond boy who is loyal to one eye keeps something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Most of all, the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, perhaps the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means ruin, but perhaps only for the already depraved.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire for annoyance, excitement and amazement.
An experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country refuses to comment on this - nor does it allow controls.
Around midnight from September 5 to 6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighters attack a mysterious cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates River; the nearest major city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur.
Their name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built in the block with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley draining from the electricity.
According to a briefing by the U.S. foreign intelligence agency CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technology from the 1950s is hardly suitable.
The CIA presented a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
By computer animation, she faded into what components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also presented photos showing the building close by or even the interior.
It was said that the reactor was on the verge of commissioning, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, little more is known than then, yes, the puzzles became bigger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that, while the CIA was quite certain of the attack, Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, there was little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence professionals in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a "alleged reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation to be "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as do the IAEA.
When asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat in the summer only answered capitarily that the IAEA had "sufficient material to ask questions".
The Syrians quickly removed the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and thoroughly levelled the site.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium produced by humans in el-Kibar.
In addition, through a Member State, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial operators from the period immediately after the attack, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings cannot be obtained on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always affirmed that it has never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
However, after analysis of the particles, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as the satellite images.
It also refuses the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent about iron.
"We will never comment on this", the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Since June 2008, the investigation of the case has been slowing down without any results and "is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority", as a high Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the IAEA is watching over.
The IAEA apparently sees three other facilities as the key to progress in the field of reconnaissance, which are supposed to be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor - and other than this one.
To date, the inspectors have not disclosed what the installations are, what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, Isis, has identified these locations and identified a building complex near Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or right next to a military base - this is precisely the reason why Syria is denying the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the USA to spy out military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip from the US secret services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material has been transported back and forth between the three locations and the block at the Euphrates.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there were "no indications of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb was to be separated from it later, there are at best plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris, which could contain valuable traces, was stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the debris has remained.
The al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River, which in 1998 examined Syria for its suitability as a radioactive waste storage facility, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, images from orbit show that Syria did earthwork at the three suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to eliminate the suspicions.
In addition, it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - only the effort shows the great interest of the inspectors.
However, Damascus also ironed this proposal.
A year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna had appeased that the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter did not have a high urgency, for example, U.S. ambassador Glyn Davies has been bringing in so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the sharpest means the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors is needed for this, and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything but eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat points out: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her nameless directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more you don't know about it - but that's enough for restlessness.
The rumour persists, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavian war.
Bosnian women's associations protested immediately, and some of the filming days planned in Sarajevo were transferred to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there is still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organisation of female victims of war wrote about the UN refugee agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie herself is ambassador of the UN refugee agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims told her enough about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, their organization has recommended that Jolie be released as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write about scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got its script to read, issued a filming permit for Sarajevo after some back and forth - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come then anyway.
The young author herself affirms that she does not pursue any political intentions with her film, that she has worked hard into the Yugoslavian conflict, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
However, it remains vague in terms of content.
A second synopsis of the film is circulating on the net, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other already before the outbreak of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is taken to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
Which sounds a lot different than the variant "rape victims fall in love with torturers".
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - that's for sure.
According to Jolie, the pressure on them is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now only the hackers of Hollywood can give her peace: by putting the script, like so many before, illegally on the net.
Let's get the hell out of here.
On this evening it is finally going really round for the Irish.
No sign of grief.
But the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans john with joy at crackling loud music, they stomping with their feet.
The Bailey pub in Cork, southern Ireland, shakes because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups - and hit them.
"Beerpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 Euro win bonus plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the restrained computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself by distracting himself from the boring question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun playing in Las Vegas, he will be conducting job interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a queasy feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and yet I don't have any work there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had a jerk, a back job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man, smiling.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: It looks like the Tanners on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, experts from the ESRI economic and social research institute in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
A huge loss for the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
If the forecasts are true, there is a wave of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing, which brought great prosperity for the Irish, Tristesse is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly disturbing for the young, well-trained Irish, for whom it has only been uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men under thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from young emigrants complaining, "Everything goes to hell in Ireland."
"There should be an insurrection against politicians and bankers - but who can, goes away and our country loses an entire generation."
"The last one will turn off the light, please."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future as the government is only blinding itself and offers no future prospects for young people.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes her fellow students shimmy from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
In doing so, men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "Working AbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers an all-round service on the topic of working abroad.
"For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
Photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada on his website.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year what it feels like to build somewhere else.
Because there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are currently raising a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan rarely sees his home in the meantime, because he makes extra shifts to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, as he stepped over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never again."
He laughs a bit embarrassed and walks through cooled-out rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the driveways park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for EUR 380,000 four years ago - 100 percent loaned.
"These were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it could go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan ponders for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have any children to feed through and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start anew."
The civil engineer doesn't like the wailing that he hears often at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is far from as dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it makes us feel Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England in the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
Leave the future open and just see how it goes with life elsewhere.
He already has a few years of work in London and why shouldn't things be going well in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend?
But there is one more thing that worries him a lot these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it might turn into a good-bye party.
"Just not too many emotions," he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
"Farewell, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a party away, relax, with some friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democatric Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These were the results of the Latinobarómetro survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly striking in this year's survey of September and October.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been growing by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of supporters of democracy rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
In Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the sharp slump last year, such a trend can also be seen.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country's democratic practice, as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Chart 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% trust their government. Both values are similar to last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%) respectively.
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crises undermined efforts to promote democracy.
The fact that this continued during the Great Depression may be due to the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short period of recession and quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were caught up by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only marginally in 2009 and fell again by 32% this year.)
But there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread sense of progress.
This is less the case in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased.
Only for the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country as a greater problem than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they or a family member have been the victims of a crime in the last year, but compared to 38% last year, the figures have fallen and thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economies: around 71% of respondents say that the private sector is essential for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuelans have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, nationalises many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9% unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
In Mexico and most countries of Central America, on the other hand, the US is the most influential country, with Venezuela taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A sloppy election
No one had expected that the elections in Haiti on 28 November would be perfect.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the electoral assistants who hurried to help the thrashed country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballot slips in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only a part of the problems.
The polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless as a result of the earthquake in January, roamed around in search of an option.
Some eventually gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, demanded that the election results be lifted due to alleged fraud.
In the whole country, there were partial violent protests.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the election "as quite good in many respects".
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The Electoral Authority, allegedly committed to the unpopular outgoing president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected runoff election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former First-Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial claim for invalidity.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no vote in favour of the voters, declares himself to be the winner of the run-off election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million earthquake victims are still living in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting due to a lack of organisation.
Shortly before the start of the election, approximately 250,000 passes needed for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government to be an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves agree.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following your husband’s sudden death, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether this will help her to re-election next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who continued to direct economic policy after his wife's election, often drew up budget plans that did not take full account of tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income at their own convenience.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further rifts.
Some regime critics from the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (where one parliamentarian slapped another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss it," the President said.
The 2010 budget now also applies to the next year, giving the President even more opportunity to spend money at his own convenience.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction its main objectives, not the reduction of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which subsequently restored official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate path now?
It has called for talks between the private sector and trade union leaders.
And official statements suggest that wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
But inflation undermined the growth spurt of a major devaluement in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to reconnect Argentina financially to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders that had rejected the country’s previous debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
Last month, however, Minister of Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" for the creation of a new national consumer price index, which looks like the first step towards cleaning up INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of her term of office, even without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which largely has enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacations in March, the wave of sympathies that has been brought to them will have deflated.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to lift many of her husband's political decisions quietly and quietly.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching closer ties with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother beyond the strait?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all voters, set out to vote for mayors and city councillors in the five districts, which is considered to be the broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed relations with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only narrowly.
Although its Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which supports Taiwan's greater independence, received almost 50% of the votes, and the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there were the usual events in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with rioters, flag-flagging mass parades and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious attempted murder.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on the eve of the election to a KMT candidate,
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a standing spectator was killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack has affected the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which has given the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not addressed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to emphasise its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also avoided too much fueling the anti-Chinese feelings.
It responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, wishes to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese are in favour of its China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It would rather wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai's reign, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP struggles for the voices of workers and youth.
Tsai, as a presidential candidate for the DPP, found great support, like Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything it can to show that she, too, is able to establish close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning an idea forge as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires non-jurisdictional discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offers a "trusted alternative" to Mas's hasty approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he said that the candidates of the DPP had done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even called on the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen's intervention, the DPP struggles to choose its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will reshape his cabinet and local institutions.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is in favour of re-approaching only to a limited extent.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no turning back."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer of the Year category
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been nominated for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
In view of the fact that Spalding has been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination seems a little unusual, but it is in line with the Grammy rules that an artist may have released no more than three albums before the release of the album with which he became known to the general public.
Her ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her lively voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can be compared to Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category of nomination Spaldings comes closest.
The album "Historicity" by the Vijay Iyer Trio was also nominated in the category instrumental albums. This favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
Iyer's competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robbing New Orleans favourite and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of Contemporary Jazz, where more of the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber are found.
The secret society of wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the category of large group. He thus competes against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose Life Ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colourful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is led by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's symphonies No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu vom Orchester des Royal Opera House"; Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales were nominated.
Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated as composers for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded at Disney Hall on January 4 by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece is entitled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concerto" received a nomination in the category Instrumental Solo with Orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he had written the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestral performance for a recording of Stravinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
This year, only women were nominated as vocal soloists, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Exkex and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, it makes me proud."
"It shows that justice reigns."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"There are wonderful people living in this valley."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides being fairly evenly distributed according to the press enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," was a comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is finished."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for non-violence.
Its community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wanted a bigger and better place than the warehouse they rented together with a water filter manufacturer.
The new, approx. 2,300 m2 mosque in the Mediterranean style should have two minarets and become about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council against the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, it is in their view a sign that a life is possible even without the elements previously considered necessary for life.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' way of life," explained Paul C.W. Davies from Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which will be published in the online issue of Science on Thursday.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in Mono Lake in California continues to grow even if it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"You wonder what else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, Anbar says.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were announced gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements, and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake due to its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, it assumed that microbes, which are both exposed, may replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so big that arsenic has a different effect than phosphorus. It enters our biochemical system, where it almost smears everything," Anbar explains.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but so far there has been no working example.
Arsenic occurred more frequently in the early Earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms have used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have developed differently than in the early Earth age," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen in front of a Bellflower motel were found on Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknown persons stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to the authorities.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are well", says Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not provide precise information on the location of the dogs nor on the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to say more about this," Whitmore explains.
"We're following some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district animal shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were unharmed.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace was due to participate in the competition.
Peek told the Times on Wednesday that the other dogs should participate in other competitions the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised a finder's fee to anyone who could give a clue to the Corgis. Microchips were implanted into the animals for identification.
On Thursday it was not yet clear whether a finder's salary will be paid.
The lion roars again after judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge officially blessed the "preparation" creed plan to repay $5 billion of debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to launch new films and television shows.
According to the statements made on Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. price law, so that MGM’s reboot under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, will no longer stand in the way of anything. Barber and Birnbaum will head the slightly slimmed-down studio as Chief Executive.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will not actually enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of investment banks, which itself brings in $75 million, is running the company. Financing is expected to stand by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to Moelis & Co, the investment bank, the management, which struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year, to help solve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial troubles and pay off the studio's more than 140 believers took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for sale.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything began from scratch when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by creditors at the end of October after months of debate and internal disputes.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month for the management of the company, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and prepared an annual plan of seven or eight films to be released in the cinemas at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan two films after "Der kleine Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio will need a separate bond of between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gimmicks can tear a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jumping ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can spare your gift budget.
Recently, looking for three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force. This year, the technology toys are more efficient and cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, there is a wider offer on the most famous ones of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
There are more and more button cell-powered toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices of Toys are "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children over 3 years old) are plush figures as big as guinea pigs who sing a note when you press their belly.
Once press corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start pressing, you can't stop.
For a combination of gesand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers alternating games like 'Simon says', and thanks to the new hinged feet with wheel blocking, it dominates the Moon walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards that can be used to drive a car to a lesson, with an expert with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you do not want to entrust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children over 8). The five blocks are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks into words before time runs out. It’s great for an improvised spelling contest.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go alone after the offer in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, you can buy, for example, a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller skates or a puffle-stuffed animal.
The latest head cell powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children over 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he can handle a lot of things.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and survived even some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are becoming more gentle
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked across an urban square, checking his nervous subordinates, giving orders with military authority and muted voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their propensity to violence - to impress the audience.
"Stand straight!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely growing out of their teenage age, stood tight with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and trousers.
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white striped bows.
"For me, they look on average," Mr. Tang remarks with contempt.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China’s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The Guangdong Province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green ones.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by staring down: in 2009, 50 officials reportedly circled an unorderly-arranged snack van and stared at the operator until he packed it in half an hour and left the square.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been reinforcing the urban police patrols. They have been selected specifically for their appearance, good figure and youth.
They're supposed to give the rude police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image the Chinese have of these city commandos.
Rightly, according to the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce urban laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officers in Hubei Province beat a spectator to death when he filmed them with his cell phone beating down a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon merchant suffered brain injuries after a handcuff with five officials.
A video game full of violence that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China in an attack on street traders.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, following further controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleaning".
Skeptics consider the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
In October, when the Distrik was looking for eight female recruits by ad, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women were supposed to have real tasks or only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with a good figure and "harmonious features".
They should be above average size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends when you reach the age of 26.
According to the officials, the work for women over 25 is too physically strenuous.
"The most important thing is their image," an unnamed district official stated at the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job first depends on their appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond that, they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's city administration, does not agree with this description.
However, it admitted that sizes in job advertisements for both sexes are not uncommon in China.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this is equivalent to good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical distortions do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use lame or hunchbacks here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrolates on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple packets and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not feel sexist that such great importance was placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to them, they do not regret the short attitude, as they have more ambitious career plans than simply to sweep traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the patrol deals with about twelve street traders who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on the bike before being chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you this so many times already!" explains Frl. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his pasta kitchen fixed on a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is monotonous rather than strenuous.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who is studying sales in the leisure sector.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of traders, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public hostility, which officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rioted after rumors that Chengguan officials had killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officers were injured in the nightly incident, 14 government vehicles were dropped or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared such violence.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patroulated that morning, over 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, contrary to regulations.
The owner screamed Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers made their way to their vehicles with a grim face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male patrol coordinator, stayed behind, turning his white name tag around to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes also physically," Mr. Li soberly explains.
"Most of the time, people start fighting."
Prosecutor won't charge Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Department of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the accusations against him after his affair with a former election worker and his attempt to give her husband lobbying, the Senator's attorneys announced on Wednesday.
This decision ended the most serious legal accusation against Senator Ensign, the Nevada Republican. Up to the scandal that caused headlines nationwide and put a damper on his career, he was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "very pleased" with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been stopped and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In their opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign disobeyed the ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first disclosed in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, helped to purchase lucrative assignments to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was a treasurer during Ensign's election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work. According to the records and interrogations, he took over Hampton’s lobbying for them after hiring him.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to lobby for a year for his former employer or the entire Senate.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on the revolving door lobby.
According to the published evidence, "it seems to be an arrangement and a violation of the revolving-door statutes," said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney specializing in the defense of clients targeted by the government.
While the Department of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the ministry seemed very cautious in taking up political charges after a number of defeats that were being pursued by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously horrifying," said Melanie Sloan, chairman of the "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" association, a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day that he was told that the ministry would not file any lawsuits against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense attorneys had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, the senator had "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I am not comfortable going into the conversation details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Just so much is said: we think we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to close the investigation of a separate lawsuit by the Ethics Group, according to which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons had violated the Federal Electoral Act.
The election commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada company that long supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 proves that, after Mr. Hampton was promoted as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a meeting with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was "anklopping" at the Ministry of the Interior about something.
Mr. Ensign was also scheduled for lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they had hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying.
Last year, when information about this affair came to the public for the first time, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he was fourth in the Republican ranking.
After many months of noticing, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was aiming for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign would no longer be the target of police investigation, his press officer, Jennifer Cooper, the senator hoped that the Ethics Commission would very quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and close its investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire calling draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them typed out in the riots in the courtroom.
In a minute’s time, they sent their reports of ghastly testimony via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape trial and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the closely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the verdict on the death sentence given by the jury falls.
But Mr. Haye's attorneys have already filed applications with the court, explaining the reasons for an appeal and who will employ the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process - also through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - led to a "circus atmosphere" and such widespread, prompt penetration of seditious details, so that the jury was unduly influenced by public indignation.
This objection could prompt the Appelation Courts to consider whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"As I experienced during this trial, I believe that it is really a danger if the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye's main defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of Appeals, rejected the motions by decision last week, when he said that the New Media would be "controlled carefully" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades, court appeals have found that reporting on notorious cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its historic decision of 1966, the United States Supreme Court overturned the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who was said to have killed his wife, saying in his decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the New Media.
Some people believe that the TV series and the feature film "On the Run" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court appeals, which Mr. Haye's conviction considered half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom, which were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in trials being pursued by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appellation courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many that Mr. Hayes' attorneys are presenting to discuss for years, delaying a conviction.
The defense attorneys also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes might have been prejudged when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their potter, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have filled them with disgust.
The defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge had mistakenly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the prosecution, and that he had unduly put pressure on the verdict when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a lawsuit they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the office of governor and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotions about the case.
"The media beepers, cameras, and reporters outside the courtroom were in such a daily rush," wrote the lawyers, "before then, they had not seen them in New Haven, and perhaps even nationwide."
Her focus on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more intimidating than reports that are being returned more slowly is a technology-hostile look that impoverishes reporting on future trials.
But some lawyers said that appellation courts were often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes needed adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's attorneys reinforce this claim.
In their opposition, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling which overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction on the grounds of reporting and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separating?
After a campaign of insults and negativity, little courtesy has erupted in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of genuine bipartisan cooperation or a moment of illusion before one quickly returns to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and Congressional leaders did not bring a breakthrough in the major issues that had to be addressed during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which decisions were no longer taken.
After all that is heard, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides, nor a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of party scoring.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that persist between members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that conceals the ideological divide that continues to separate members from each other.
That is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one demands from the other sign of willingness to cooperate and compromise, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a renewed party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or entitlements, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least, Washington's November election voted mildly for at least a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections evoke party passions that die again.
And that's a good thing."
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session", Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, even if only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the tax cuts favoured by the rich are being preferred, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday, optimism has increased that we can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
However, William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session" will not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of inconsistency is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - that politeness leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what happens from today until 2012, as a pre-match, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their education.
No matter how worried the Republican leaders may be that they are poking too high, they know that they need to try to keep their promises to cut government spending and override health reform.
These party lines are already evident in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include a tax reform and raising some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and lowering government spending.
Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have so much pressed for the deficit issue to be placed on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan the official recommendation and they are fighting very hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the panel, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes when Republican Obama challenges the state budget, taxes, and healthcare system, later followed by a phase of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanity and polarization are greater today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a wider ideological divide between Obama and the Congressional republicans than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a pure prelude to a far more far-reaching election in 2012.
In this way, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator on the issues that still separate them from each other.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of the "Kleptokratie" and it passes on part of the bribes and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin. Thus, in February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service extort large amounts of protection money so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, they say.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of authority" - takes its share of the money that the leaders are moving upwards.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on his homepage on Tuesday by WikiLeaks.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly any evidence that in the meantime would have been cleaned up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won numerous libel lawsuits against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian TV station when he was asked for a documentary that suggests he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe their society is corrupt, according to polls.
But it is unusual that, as happens in the Ambassador's report, individual persons are called, and it is unheard that this is done by a diplomat from a foreign country.
"The direct connection between the government of Moscow and crime has led some to call it "disturbed" and to conclude that the government acts more like a kleptocrat than a government," the memo says.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends through the police, the state security (FSB), the service authority (MVD) and the prosecutor's office as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov comes first."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB is collecting money from the largest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
One source, so it is said, "declared that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"For this reason, the protection of criminal gangs is no longer as needed as it was before."
The memo notes that, while collecting the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - due to one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has talked several times about fighting corruption, but has also noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the embassy contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow commission of experts, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is no part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Countrywide, estimates By, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt").
The revelation of the memo of the American Embassy, which happened late in the evening after Moscow, will certainly cause displeasure within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow's mistakes, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to confront the past
In a lighted, concrete classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds of the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge reign known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrender to the government, long-time supporters in Anlong Veng are challenged.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims to engage in public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook that tells the story of Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a joint tribunal of the UN and Cambodia first condemned a former Khmer Rouge member when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng Torture Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodian society more difficult.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia's documentation center, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides even families."
During Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed, or died of disease, overwork, or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government fell in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary waged the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to government, leading to the capitulation of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given in, was arrested by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in the prison of Phnom Penh in 2006, where he waited for his trial.
When their patrons stopped protecting them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the grueling poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elitist officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to justice.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has done little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who had been district head in the province of Manteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she had told representatives of the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers probably died.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court were to subpoena her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court accused more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia has to dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to go forward, Chhang Youk of the Documentation Centre said.
"Reconciliation with Khmer times means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that we can understand everything."
The centre created the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are convicted by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court gradually gain influence," he said.
Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dangrek mountains, a path covered with shrubs and covered with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a cell phone saleswoman on the side of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will take a bush of ripe bananas - hoping that he will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to stop the accumulation of weapons-grade uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's global nuclear security campaign, the Belarus government announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
For years, the US government had tried to persuade Belarus to stop collecting highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But US government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements have been made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-capable uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official staff member who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclear 47 Nations Security Summit" in April, which had ruled Belarus out.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they wanted a seat in the nuclear security summit (2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has stated that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons-capable, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we won't make any dirty bombs out of it and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the US a few months ago when it indicated interest in an agreement meeting.
The first attempt to remove Belarus' uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train that took more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say officials.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and, according to the officials, was carried out by plane.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for this effort, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy working on Global Hazard Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Distributive Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible approach.
"Welcome to the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections by the Spanish Government to CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaeda prisoners across Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as a telegram from the U.S.A. Ambassador in Madrid shows.
This is reflected in the documents enveloped by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (via cable). It is added that the former deputy head of government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe in which the aid to practices in violation of human rights was accused in a dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The deputy head of government admitted that the Council's report "hit Zapatero offside" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain had no objections to the secret service flights over Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be informed" so as not to be "unprepared to be surprised", Aguirre reports by cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, since it is in the hands of the judges."
Prosecutor Vicente González, in his turn, told the embassy in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information provided by the CNI and the Department of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manage discreetly between governments," Aguirre complains.
At a lunch in March 2007, attended by the Ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Minister of the Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are insanely keen on their independence and do what they think is appropriate," he had given instructions to his staff to "avoid inflated rhetorical comments in order to let the tension fade away."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
"Despite their generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt capitalize on a hint that the government of Zapatero's actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations will be tolerated or deliberately ignored, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government," he emphasizes.

He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his ex-husband never let him perform a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages, it can be concluded that their love affair broke up and they parted.
In March 2008 she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him, he liked it, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not be free, do and leave what he wants."
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her cell phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address that I can send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that if everything goes well, she will take her firstborn with her.
"He will be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me. I will never leave him with anyone else but my mother again", a dubious intention when considering their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes these, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and allegedly was murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, he is not."
"On the one hand he is with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
17th: Memories and complaints.
"A huge kiss from César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail.
On the 30th another: "The boy is fine. He goes into a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there's one: "He's shooting money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked up, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison discharger."
"Terror a la gallega (Heading)".
The last man who lived with her, an sworn hunting overseer, declares to have a remorse for feeling guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she hadn't told him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred to the provincial prison of Palma yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners in Menorca.
The public defender, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not remember the course of events, "and that she had no intention of harming the little one."
Before, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and storing his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutor's office applied for a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing its attention on the parliamentary elections - ahead or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as those in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday the PPC scored 384,091 votes.
If this rising trend - as a result of the redirection of the PSC's vote and the commitment of the PP's electorate - persists, PP analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 members of Congress during the parliamentary elections, while CiU also gained four (now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 members (out of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one Member - currently has three - while ICV could hold its Member or gain one.
If, however, the election calendar is maintained, the next date for the municipal elections will be May 2011. Even then, the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue on the balance to put an end to socialist domination, namely in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the city council of Barcelona, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the socialists will not be able to achieve a majority or rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable that this party will lose its representation in Barcelona's municipal council, where it would have to achieve 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, saw an increase in its votes in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the leading role in Tarragona’s turnaround, where they ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
The People's Party has also seen a significant increase in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The PP is currently represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three others in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by police from the Barcelona Police Intelligence Agency formed the jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, the various Al Qaeda groups, including the " Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lashkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the attacks in Bombay, which claimed 106 deaths in 2008 - provided passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, which go so far as to assure that "Operation Kampai" has "weakened" Al Qaida's falsification apparatus around the world and "thus its ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and then sent to the groups of the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could unpunishedly cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The exposed cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that has been active in Europe. Therefore, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have also participated in the investigation. It cannot be excluded that in the area of the EU there will be similar attacks in the next few days as the one that was carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was carried out in Thailand, in which the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
From Bangkok they had led the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - a part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - stole in particular tourist passports according to the specifications of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents had to be issued in the name of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
Investigations have shown that, until now, no links have been established between those arrested in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay, although the author of the attack was "Lashkar e-Taiba", one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack from Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent by means of a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command", which put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have confiscated extensive documentation.
PP calls on Mas to postpone the tax agreement
Yesterday, the chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity to personally present Artur Mas with her terms of office in support of his appointment as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These are not different from those already made during the election campaign and can be summed up with the priority of economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial settlement agreement, which the regionalist leader intends to propose at the height of his mandate.
The chairman of the Catalan People's Party turned with certainty to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 deputies she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties abstaining from voting when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible Entente with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently holding with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
As far as the party leaders of the PPC are concerned, they demand that "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial compensation between the state and the autonomous region - similar to the Basque country - and which the party leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum be put to a back seat in support of taking office.
Both political leaders have in common that they want to make the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat deal with the details of the negotiations for the inauguration of Mas.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritate Catalana).
The nursing home for the elderly confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the old people's home in Olot do not rule out the fact that their caretaker killed more than eleven elderly people
The leaders of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they pointed out what harm the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmé - the caretaker who had killed at least eleven old people during his work, for whom he was responsible - had done to the institution.
The head of the nursing home for the elderly, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced that "La Caritat wants to sue the person responsible (for the deaths), but "the law and our liability force us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution has to accept not only a social loss of reputation because it had not detected the criminal acts of the caretaker in time, but now also pay a large amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he had continued to murder ever since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home for the elderly - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities due to their age and illnesses were handled by telephone.
La Caritat's head denied this point and stated that "no measures could have been the reason for the incidents at any time."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there is no evidence in the lawsuit of negligent acts of any person other than the accused."
The one who was already baptized as a "death angel" confessed eleven murders the day before yesterday and declared that he had committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later murdered the second old lady.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said that the access of the personnel to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the sedative cocktail used the caretaker in six out of nine crimes committed to free the patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims or whether he burned them out from the inside by giving them bleach, as he had confessed to three women whom he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat one does not believe the statements of the caretaker, not even with regard to the number of confessed murders, which could well be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to change his procedure suddenly after eight successful murders.
They say they made it available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threatening Signs of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The risk premiums of the euro peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have risen by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be mistaken and that the euro has hardly increased in points, which causes concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market which is recovering to the extent that it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will by no means lose his fear.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to retreat for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the closure of the plan for the purchase of sovereign debt, as these were ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only one week of open-ended access should be maintained.
Following the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly calls for tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity to be maintained until at least June.
We also expect that the program to purchase bonds will continue and issue a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of yesterday's markets will be thrown back and if we insist halvingly on taking back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB meeting in May, at which the Bank confirmed that it would not take into account the purchase of sovereign debt and that the markets would collapse, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, which provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was rather weak.
The state wealth management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in market perception according to Trichets.
In Ireland, the figures for the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum is estimated at approximately 10,000 million in the short term and a possible further 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks are nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after failing to recognise the stress test problem in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will have to receive parliamentary approval of its new budget, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate with regard to the summit of heads of state and government on 14 December, where political unity is needed to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish President yesterday presented the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions as well as in financial institutions, reduction of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound like Vivaldi's Four Seasons in the ears of investors.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. Therefore, we rely on a strong demand that will remove all doubts about our rescheduling capacity.
For Spain, applying for a help plan would be self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with Caesar's wife's motto: "Now not only the being counts, but also the appearance."
Courage, we can do it!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Board of Eulen contests the general meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the Eulen and El Enebro companies, does not fade.
David Álvarez, founder of the company gurppe, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, because he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services does not appear to be willing to give up in his litigation over the control of the El Enebro bodies.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed Board members at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year, which is already registered as contested in the Commercial Register.
The shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, triggered a new thunderbolt in the lap of the Álvarez family.
Invoking the judge to appoint the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the general meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as "a desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to have the annulled assembly of 18 January recognized by means of legal subtleties, fraudulent machinations and abuse of rights", as official spokespersons explain.
This argument is the basis for the contestation of the assembly in retrospect, in order to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, who envelop themselves in discreet silence, tried in June already unsuccessfully to convene a meeting by judicial means.
At El Enebro - the wealth company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
That is the very background to the case on which the judge has to decide in the hearing to deal with the action for challenge for which no date has yet been fixed.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the Formula One world in 2004, its history has been marked by surprises and successes in this exquisite universe of speed.
In the beginning, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising career during the last season, all put on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari at the final sprint last November.
Without trying to reduce the capabilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault's engine, the "secret weapon" put into the hands of the Multi Siemens Red Bull and thus created a winning team has become a legend.
In reality, this is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes not related to car racing.
This software program, known as PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is used before it is actually built, in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial department, explains that using this software in the Formula 1 - factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and execute the changes and improvements that are found on the races and during the tests.
Russwurm states that in 1992 an average of ten technicians worked in the racing stables, who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in one season.
Today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed in Red Bull’s team. They carry out analyses and all possible changes to the race car with high-performance computer systems.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull's racing cars, except for the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed.
Thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours.
The only limit set to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula One team can spend on its races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are very limited.
All that's happening there is Top Secret.
The staff consists of 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula One hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer places in the service of its participation on the racetracks, there are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose awareness is zero.
Steve Nevey, head of technology at the plant, stressed that five years ago it was possible to say that the progress in the field of R&D contributed to the victory for racing cars with 50 percent and that the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, shares have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDP, because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated his first exclusive shop in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes yesterday in Barcelona.
It is the first of a network of 20 shops, each covering 80 to 100 square metres, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees on this initiative with the existing 16 multi-brand sales areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP España, Helena Herrero, gave an example of the converted shop at Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 offices in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Mrera did not want to betray the new openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next destination.
The vice president, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the shop opening philosophy is always the same. She relies on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe all shops will look the same.
HP is also responsible for the training of shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales network was intended to "optimize customer service and advice to small and micro-enterprises in purchasing and after that, even packaging."
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro-enterprises as well as private customers, as large companies already have service contracts for technical after-sales service," Helena Herroro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants to steal a million customers from his rival in three years
Banco Sabadell’s executive board member, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a fall in interest rates, which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years' time - a still too existing subject.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without using the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000 if you deduct the customers that will lose the bank - which is the major challenge facing this bank, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has added 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is to increase productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the annual report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has upset all banks’ plans worldwide.
Sabadell will complete its four-year-old Optima plan this year, which was initially designed for three years, but has been extended by one financial year as a result of the market situation.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by APIE Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain will only "slowly" get out of the crisis.
Moreover, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of banks.
Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - which punishes the interest margins - will fade away, the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their issues in order to obtain liquidity will already be passed on to the price of loans as compensation for dwindling profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We didn't turn the rooster off, but the interest differentials are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued an order to its branch network on Thursday to limit the granting of long-term loans and to increase interest-rate differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the stategie of "increasing charges", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell's guidance plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
It is not for nothing that he assures us that "bigger companies are necessary in Spain."
"Everything will change next year," he assures.
It stresses that the demand for capital is currently "increasing in an enormous way" and does not rule out the possibility that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red figures.
He felt that the FROB could replace the money market in the event of capital stockpiles.
After asserting that Sabadell could survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refutes the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put into circulation, but unlike the events in June, one could obtain short-term funding through repo transactions and thus intercept the crisis.
CECA excludes a second wave of savings banks
Yesterday, CECA Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta denied the possibility of a merger wave of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the sector was being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not insist on participating in the first phase. They reserved the second round.
On the other hand, José Antonio Olavarrieta, Director General of the Spanish Savings Banks Association (CECA), said that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed, and the inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be regarded as a second round, but rather as adjustments."
"Most of it has been completed. We may have thirteen or fourteen instead of seven, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all processes."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process "was completed as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely process that was established in earlier times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, so that we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta stated that "there were a number of inappropriate opinions about the slowness of the process, the unseriousness and nonsense" because "Banco de España exhorts us to complete before the end of the year."
Yesterday, the Director General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" the whole world and added that those who doubted this would do so "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic environment, we need to "not worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very important" process of concentration that will be carried out "as quickly as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed very well the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has chosen to retain the euro, but at the same time has established conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the lifting of the 426 euro support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany takes on a fundamentally new perspective for shaping our future, which collides with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second is the reintroduction of the German mark - although it sounds more like science fiction at the moment - supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a reshaping of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of the countries that exceed the requirements; possibly the cessation of payments by some countries as well as the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been taking shape for some time. That is why there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government withdrew a constitutional reform to prevent this from 2016 onwards.
This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was set by the Central European country when Merkel painfully pushed out the decision to save Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public opinion and the public opinion were absolutely against saving Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel comes out again with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements in order to enable a country to be saved while at the same time obliging private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it precipitated the Irish crisis and all the following.
However, their proposal, albeit slightly sweetened, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will be taking part in the reform of the European Union, which will allow for these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures must now be taken, the old functioning of the euro will no longer be possible from this date on.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area in which the conflicting countries will be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent and, in this case, the private sector will have to bear part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard course in growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as led by Spain in booming times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It is not just a matter of bringing the government deficit down to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is cheat on ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will move into more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this, too, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in his own house has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like it would change anything.
Among the options considered is the fact that we would have to leave the euro area which is full of little serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regularity
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The exclusion, allegedly instigated by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League, led to a lot of ink being shed about whether it was an unsporting act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will fulfill the prescribed penalty in the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
Provoking a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice; it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules followed in this sport.
Part of the ensuing debate about the case is that a team of Real Madrid football club (who in his anthem pretended to be noble and honorable and on other occasions punished his players for similar incidents) played the leading role in this, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who added one episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this behaviour, which is not explicitly prohibited by the Statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts constitute a rule-change. Indeed, this approach adheres to the Statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter, the damage caused to the sporting spirit should be investigated.
The sport spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the opposing players gain an unjustified benefit from the opposing team. This did not happen either.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not correspond to what we normally mean by playing the wrong game or circumventing the rules, because the circumvention of the rule was not carried out secretly in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as conspicuous as possible for it to be punished by the referee.
The players waited and accepted the penalty joyfully.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders drew from the deliberate fouls.
It should be pointed out here that the rival was not put in a worse position, nor were any advantages for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that his own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The obvious advantage is that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually also withdraw. In addition, with this approach, the players receive a penalty and pass into the second card cycle, where they exit with a card less than in the first cycle due to card accumulation.
It is therefore not so clear whether it really is an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the sport spirit, which also includes strategic decisions in order to benefit from the rules as much as possible.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent a sanction (which would actually be a clear case of rule circumvention), they wanted to choose when they would submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or fleeing from a punishment.
Although the boundary between inventiveness and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the polemics arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the kind of provoked rule transmission.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer campaign to catch customers for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year drops an avalanche of reservations to the days of 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves spread out. They don’t want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the pre-Christmas period, which supply oxygen to Barcelona’s restaurants and leisure activities. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive in order to capture the customer segment, which represents the great mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the companies and associations surveyed confirm.
To make accounting a bit more complicated, the calendar (Silverster falls on a Friday) dropped all orders in the week of December 13, with the result of an avalanche of reservations from dinner to two top days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for household reasons.
In order not to have to renounce this tradition, many workers pay for it from their own pockets.
Whatever the economic situation, lowest prices are required, confirmed Gaietà Farràs, president of the Barcelona Board of Restaurants.
Until now, the representative of the umbrella organisation does not dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it 'tires of times before they reserve."
"They want to go out, but they pay great attention to prices," he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with good service", he adds, and reminds us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices are most in demand by 25 euros.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants, it turns out that the evening of 17 December leads the providers to collapse.
The Soteras Group says that the demands for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would be booming. The Group has adapted its menus with complete offers of between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, one does not lose the optimism, after the second quarter the revenues bloom again and good, although concentrated on a few days prospects for the Christmas business is looked forward.
Sources of the Group point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
In addition to the six group menus, a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added as a price hit. It seems that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Some companies also see green sprouts sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are back on the rise.
On the part of the Federation of Fecasarm (with associations such as the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the vice-chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "lively" overall, although the customers "beat out a maximum".
However, the fun of celebrating has not declined, no matter who pays.
Pakistan’s nuclear programme is causing great concern in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Wikileak revelations confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US Department of State revealed by the Wikileaks web portal confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistan nuclear program Washington.
On the edge of the clarifying and juicy details provided by the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries is not reinforced in terms of nuclear security, but on the contrary "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but their parts are stored in order to make their destruction more difficult in the event of a possible attack - make Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks are listed by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the Taliban-attacked area, the probable dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer regarded by the US alone, but also by Russia as an outburst and a reason to exercise caution.
"Pakistan needs to hire strict-faith personnel to guard nuclear facilities; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to re-direct people working on nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that US-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation is slowing down and the increased pace of Pakistan producing nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the Embassy, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," explains: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive any answers to help, or they are rejected."
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington to "clarify" the person responsible during a visit by General Ashfaq Kayani, Chief Army Officer, that "Pakistan's army must cease its tacit support of terrorist groups."
Hunting for Wikileak's boss
Obama appoints a high person responsible for the anti-terrorism struggle to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning to persecute and find Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which the facts can be solved only difficult.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red warning" about the "discovery and persecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional order to arrest.
Besides, it's not new, it's from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the recent disclosure of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
The lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, also assures "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
Already on the 20th, the international police authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not notified until yesterday after receiving the authority from the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify and locate Assange, "in order to arrest and deliver him for the time being."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member states consider the red warning to be a licence for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is probably staying.
Assange's lawyers, who issued a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities via video conference, were outraged by the action.
They also recall that Assange requested to leave Sweden and was granted permission by the prosecutor, who was compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal prosecution," the letter accuses.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia asserts the innocence of her son - Assange stays in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an indefinite location. During the interview, he applied for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has appointed a high-ranking figure in charge of the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
The President's spokesman Barack Obama's attempt to pay less attention to Assange is in contrast to the opinions expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January onwards, has called on the Department of State to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to seize their funds and pursue anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be "murdered".
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was who leaked information in the government, he is guilty of treason, and all that is not execution is too mild a punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a wink to the Carod
The Republican leader allows the party to hold a secret vote on its continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid for the tens of years an internal turmoil in the ranks of the ERC without direction after the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party leader is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the loved ones of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor himself and will not give him the same headache as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries with a wink to win over the new critics, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For the start, it was announced yesterday that the more than 200 Regional Council members of ERC could speak out in secret about his remaining in office.
With ballots, not with a raised hand.
If the carodists wanted to give the president a ticket, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he affirmed that he would feel with half the votes plus one not confirmed, and he added without stating percentages that a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod allies demand more from the president than just giving the party its office. An insufficient gesture, as Puigcercós controls the supreme organ of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the board a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, which will be submitted to the Council for a vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to vouch for Puigcercós. In return, Puigcercós is to promise to move the congress forward to the autumn of 2011, which the party leadership already thinks is a fact.
The party leader of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" is a pity of stability and he once and for all strives to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article that the current Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party leader was supported "in exchange for various goals".
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the executive board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party's members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second one could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally abandon the general assembly principle as a way of working.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the Statutes, which is intended to enable Congresses to be held with elected delegates.
Puigcercós' team, who fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with ending the general assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the quaking assembly in 2008, the party leadership was charged with reviewing the general assembly principle at a congress that was to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still pending, as infogle's internal rest of the last few years was not advisable to tackle this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors lying in wait, the time may have come to take up this matter again and conclude it forever.

Next to him, the police found a cardboard box with a message.
China maintains its targets for reducing greenhouse gases
At COP16, China's representative said that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and that it would maintain its offer to cut 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China is holding its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, says Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
At his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations World Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and transform its industry.
He said that over the past four years his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he said that China would not change its objectives, but would work on this matter with the international community.
He explained that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress had been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which included the objectives of reducing emissions of gases, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China the state authorities had worked with the central state and the municipalities to achieve the goals of saving energy, using energy effectively and reducing emissions.
Moreover, he said, several multi-year plans have already been launched or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those who received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the effective use of energy programme introduced over the past five years, which had received United Nations (UN) investment, government investment and private ownership.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another on the exchange of traditional light bulbs through energy-saving bulbs, and another on mitigation and adaptation, he said.
Martin Krol, scientific government advisor on climate change in this country, confirmed that China’s efforts were far greater than was generally believed to be.
He pointed out that per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amounted to six tonnes per person, while in the United States they amount to 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to pollution.
It also makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20 percent over the last five years and another is expected to happen by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion of Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former president of the Panist Party had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and to demand what the law would give him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento was right and that the former party leader of the PAN had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and to demand what the law would give him.
In an interview that took place before Gabino Cué Monteagudos' appeal as governor of the state, he stated that the exclusion of Espino was a decision taken at the local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right in his case to appeal to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision to be taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he said, it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidate had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge stronger from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the or the best chairperson that Acción Nacional would need for the next three years, so he would hand over the stakes "to the one that the Council would decide."
"I am quite unconcerned and open. I would be proud to be the leader of the party for each of the five."
He predicted that the party's upswing in the last elections of 4 July would be reflected in the next elections, although "it is not time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would bear the flag and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and longings are placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the height of demands."
When asked about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón about his disc course in his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI's supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should begin to defend them, should they finally get out of the closet," he affirmed.
He is of the opinion that the owner of the federal government can make expressions such as those he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no ban on mouths and even less censorship.
Obama advocates the law in favor of undocumented students in Twitter
"If you are in favour of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and urge them to pass this law," the president of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization to support the Dream Act – Law to Legalize Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you are in favour of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and urge them to pass this law," Obama tweeted.
His brief statement contains a cyber link to a larger document that calls on the public to get in touch with their senators, as the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice that we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for each law, except the extension of tax reductions from the times of Bush and the funding of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trust that once the tax issue has been resolved, a timetable for the other projects can be established.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the process of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would apply for the vote to end the debate" so that the Dream Act, which would allow the initiative to legalize undocumented students to be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, although next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or American Dream Law, would legalize about 800,000 young people who migrated to the United States when they were less than sixteen years old, while living in that country for the past five years and enrolled in a higher education institution or army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they depend on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At present, the organizations of the advocates of this project organise an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of whom the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, has announced his support for the law.
Therefore, if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side.
Among the most popular Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had voted in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet determined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the biggest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The desire for language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand about sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-language literature and used the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble," the Argentine writer sweetly spit at the audience, composed mainly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text which she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and which Shultz subsequently identified as a great narrative. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to know what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of which she does not receive an answer, but receives hints for the guideline of her narrative.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe this is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath away in the middle of the walk, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst discovers the secret: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist". But she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful story, which he called 'the praise of invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorcerer who touched the clouds, brought back far-traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story turned around and told of America, the great novel that from the beginning did not lack its own chroniclers, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers), mocked the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told - with imagination, which even lost the sense of shame."
However, he points out that "it is the madmen and liars who best imagine things", and there reality and lie approach each other, where one no longer knows to what side the narrative belongs, where the fictitious literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls this the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"From him we have inherited to be what is told."
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which FIl's invitation to the round table 'The finger in the wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman devoted her contribution to the great wound of social violence that afflicts her country - like the whole of Latin America - as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, unwittingly planned commitment," she explained after highlighting that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction."
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution was also "the finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer".
He noticed that in a fast-paced world, the intellectual habits and control of consciousness also come down to dogmatisms, forgetting that "there is a little no behind every confirmation and a little yes behind every denial."
"In order to be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we need to nuance: And nuances often mean putting your finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also harassing the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noted and invited one to rediscover the sense of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final, there are also two different styles set by their respective coaches, and their encounter, marked by opposites, is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has held well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has advanced with the medal to the second champion, he has stayed one step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santist strategist reached the first final as coach of the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he suffered a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to take a setback again, as the game was undecided with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at the penalty he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to take his title, but ultimately three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be pursued again by misfortune and free himself from the evil spell in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection that I surrender to, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," commented the helmsman when asked about the lost finals.
The last final has remained in his memory, he assures us that he has learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were prepared with two penalty meters already to withdraw, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no reason to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shootout does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at penalty shootout, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the fierce striving to hold the title already in the hands, that left us something for this endgame, and we hope that it will not happen this time."
It is in Romanso's power not to be only second champion anymore and to taste for the first time the fame that the titles bring with them.
The US changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Prior to their meeting with the consulate, persons must present themselves to the visa application services, thereby reducing the cost of waiting times.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa at the United States Embassy and Consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves to the visa application services (ASC, the initial letters in English) before talking to the consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be verified by the consulate before the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of handling the visa is decreasing, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately for the appointment, processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed over.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counter to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for handers and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not need to have a conversation at the consulate, they only have to introduce themselves to the nearest ASC, where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
Since the biometric data are collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the conversation at the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for a visa at the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the 26 dollar service surcharge.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassisy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency called a press conference to present a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aerospace Agency (NASA) of the United States announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented by experts in astrobiology at a press conference tomorrow at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C. This is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When convening the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a prudent find for the search for extraterrestrial life," which sparked speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it can exist in hostile environments, which were previously thought to be uninhabitable, human-like creatures. The hypothesis was raised that these could be transformed into intelligent beings - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
Apparently it is a microbe found on the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was considered too toxic for all conceivable life forms, since the lake is highly arsenic.
In some way, the microbie uses arsenic as a survival resource. Considering this ability, the chances increase that there might be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, astrobiologists say, "there is actually another life form, a second life form that differs from the one we know."
The Space Agency will announce the actual scope of its findings at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is investigating the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) under the question of whether its chemical composition resembles that of the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
With the reform of the Organ Law on Congress the two-party system would be introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and a bloc of opposition, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, was already installed, who imagined himself to be independent. The four questioned the following: the entry of the 'two-party system' into the Chamber.
Before the introductory session began, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez von Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza von der PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo von der PRD and Patrón Montalvo weathered against the reform of the Organ Law, as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties controlling Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Bureau headed by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political marginality with these reforms.
He said that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, starting from their political will and if they did not, they would be subjugated by both parties again, putting an end to the opposition coalition.
"Until now I have come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, which do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia said that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralistic group was formed.
It cannot be admitted, he continued, that Congress, after being monopolistic, is now supposed to be "duopolist".
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that an eternal bipartisan system should prevail in Congress."
"For the start, this group starts with five MPs and they talk to other colleagues so that they become more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT pointed out in allusion to PAN and PRI that the Congress had at the moment turned into a 'jump' for two.
"Before, it was just a party, now they're split up in two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Members and give them their place at the negotiating tables.
"The top five, which are likely to be nine Members, must not be left out because of top decisions; the five, which are currently seen as split into different groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of it reform, which has been carried out and agreed by the others, we have stayed outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 more pesos for "the supplier"
The Mazatlán municipality pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check for just over 200 000 pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year amounts to 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for greater transparency of the city administration, this cheque issued to an amount of 200,144.56 peso with the number 9258447 was issued last November 16 with the purpose of "clearing open invoices".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent in advance that more money would go from the community to this supplier. She is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount owed to her and, as a result, the number of cheques still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, just the debts are paid, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "appeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24th, two of October 15th, October 19th, October 29th and this last of November 16th.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, when a company is called into question by ASE in order to avoid other administrations applying for its services, the treasurer assured that its services would not be re-used.
After the Noroeste newspaper published on July 25 the examination of the cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it became known that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of office of mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had already paid more than 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also transactions with Jumapam, where she collected cheques worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist places must be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and have a bad image of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada Trade Association, recalled that, on different occasions, it was called upon to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and sidewalks had a negative effect, as the tourists came to wander and saw the disorder, whereupon they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day, and they don't worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction work this way slowly and planlessly."
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist had drawn attention to the lack of prevention and maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community must take on its responsibility and avoid this happening again. How should it do this? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of repairing everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it needs to be maintained, but we residents, too, have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration must change its strategy in order to maintain the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlan."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps the tourist attractions constantly in motion," he added.
"Not enough attention has been paid to these arrangements and these kinds of incidents expose what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving Mazatlan's tourist sites because they were not used properly and gave rise to a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought up to date together with the city, and to make the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites that first of all need to be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive to tourism and to bring them to the inventory with which we advertise for this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
Mazatlán's business sector calls for a worthy parliament, free from collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is troubled and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM. That makes a total of 40 representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and to the different social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Council, suggested that the new MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that MEPs will really exercise their right to act freely from collusion between the parties, because it is customary for them to enter into agreements with which they represent their own interests, thus transforming them into carnival companions of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they do a trustworthy job and, above all, work for society and its groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them their confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas hotel association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in some way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new MEPs to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary status in the state budget in order to promote it.
"I understand that it is the Ministry with the second least means. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
Funds must be allocated to tourism projects, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been recast in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
Holy King Is Wanted
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family long for dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
On the next Epiphany day, it will be difficult for parents to fulfill these wishes, for the household is composed of no more than twelve persons and one goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing they so desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from the hand to the mouth, because the father has no firm work.
"Sometimes it's hard times because my husband doesn't have a job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I'm going out on the street with the brats for sale," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for some time and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús proposes Cayetana clothing in size for one-year-olds.
"(José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would so much like this monster,' but I answered him, 'Let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe is the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaías is the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel is the size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in the size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the lobby of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network, ten house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, in places that were said to have served mainly the manufacture of drugs.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, of whom two of the men considered to be the main conductor of the drug ring are from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons were said to have appeared in front of the Sherbrooke justice building hours after their arrest.
They could be accused, among other things, of accusing the production of cannabis, its possessions for sale, the plot and the service of crime.
These searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation that took place for over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," said M. Ruel.
Around 70 police officers from the Estrien Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke Police Department and the Memphrémagog Police Department had participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could easily be tracked
The Conservative bill, which, according to the government, is intended to address the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, will probably be thwarted after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this Charter."
"I hold with a party that has put shackles on your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus meeting in front of the assembled deputies.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person identified as a sea ship for the transport of illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the Canadian constitution of law and freedom as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he opposed the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
Criticism regarding the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has dismissed the critics who demand that their party did not stand firm enough against the secret immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree that action should be taken against the blind passengers, and this is precisely what we are trying to implement by means of another draft law, the C-35," said Chow.
We therefore do not support the Conservative bill because it seeks to blame the refugees and keeps children in prison for at least a year," Chow said.
Immigration minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly inform the MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, these criminal activities that affect Canada and that treat the country like a foot-dropper."
"They expect Canada to take tough action," said Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, one Conservative has said to the QMI agency that the government would convene a vote so that every opposition MP would immediately declare himself to his voters.
The new unity does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement by Jean Charest of the possible creation of a new standing unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public inquiry committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea is not from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
Since 1870, the metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the least at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
Nor was it missing that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as a "hatted rabbit" and "ready-made solution at the end of the table".
In turn, Minister Dutil had turned to those who feared that political power would have too much influence on the question of future unity.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he contentedly affirmed.
"You're aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, president of CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means to form a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and political systems at the ENA (State High School for the Training of Senior Administrative Officials).
In order to get out of this impasse, he suggests that Quebec give a special mandate to audit the financial system so that it can investigate corruption and collusion.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of audit," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could grant audit control the same power as Commissioners, which would also allow it to oblige people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the penal law to be better prepared for this type of crime.
This demand comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, for his part, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, was currently dealing with certain amendments relating to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which affected the motorcycle police groups, 131 people were arrested, although the criminal law had not been amended.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict supervision
Several river courses remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has erupted since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, a landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has sunk into it.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rains of 40 to 70 millilitres of precipitation have poured into several regions.
Between 20 to 40 millimeters of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were the most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had gone down here.
Since the melting of snow, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, is to be added to these precipitations, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings about the flood alarm on the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the region of Lanaudière, heavy rainfall has led to the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and also in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte an evasive bridge was demolished due to heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Security remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, said Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec National Flood Centre issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially reproved
The Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) because of his controversial statements about social welfare and Haitians as well as because of his ostentatious speech on radio.
The CCNR believes that while M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their own opinion, certain statements "have contained inaccurate information about the Haitians' social welfare and unjustified negative representations, as well as such an unsophisticated manner of speech that is not appropriate to the broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide was in breach of the broadcasting code.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the broadcasts in the period 2008 and 2010.
The first order was made following a complaint by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators should provide sound information rather than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, host Stéphane Dupont said that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account the fact that the consequences of the "Dupont le midi" programme had raised a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate way."
Therefore, he was not blamed for his person.
The last point of dispute concerned the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
In this regard, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had a media-effective dispute that had caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI presenter had declared that he did not give in favour of Haiti aid, since one would not know with certainty whether the needy would actually receive the donations.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments were not abusive in character, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative presentation of the Haitians.
"I have already forfeited my three-day suspension sentence on this matter."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," the moderator explained.
In all resolutions, the Supervisory Board denounces the dissemination of an unsophisticated language.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, who, among other things, was supposed to have communicated his decisions once during the main delivery period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal Algerian origin, has set a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing as well as in Thai boxing, now rises in search of new challenges on the tatami and in the boxing rings of the world.
"I started martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing in Algeria 12 years ago," said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
Personally, I'm looking for the fight everywhere, because for those who don't like the ground fight as mixed martial arts present it, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the security official and UPS employee had given his rivals bad news in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championship, held between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the victory in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"At present I am preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"The fighters from each category had been invited who had placed among the first four at the last World Championship."
"I made bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005 I became eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished fifth in the tournament in China, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is worth noting that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will become first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines from China, in which punches and kicks as well as floor throws are permitted.
The fights usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxing fighter who emerged from this type of martial arts is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal were to retain only one event in his career, he would surely call his presence here at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung Fu.
"This competition is the highest ranking and most prestigious in China," explained the sympathetic Pfundskerl.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a super experience."
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-finals of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category stand up to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has jointly approved $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a total of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a companion to Hydro-Québec's decision to hand over to the private sector its responsibility to hand over this important hydroelectric project to a total of 5 billion dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" obtained the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, resorting to business consortia is a serious ethical problem, which raises the risk of disincentives and increases in prices.
"This is a new way of playing a staked game and disarms the competition."
"This means that instead of playing cards, you are now performing in an open form instead of in a secret way," said Sylvain Simard, MP of the PQ, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, for it seems difficult to understand how public interest can be served in this way.
In the afternoon, Nathalie Normandeau, Minister of Resources, had responded by vehemently denying that this contract had been a defrauded game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she bet, strengthening that the PQ had "been dishonest" and "missing it in hardness."
She said it was "be the least" that the PQ apologized.
The consortium model is common practice worldwide.
It is usually such a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity in terms of its workload.
The construction process is in progress and is expected to be in place by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without any competition; negotiations had already taken place.
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects, is by no means an exception.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A short flight over the Quebec Business Register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of constant duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, goes back to one and the same legal entity, namely Dessau.
As regards the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the Baie James territory is subject to a special labour force dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has made the nose of the fact that the contract for project management has been approved by agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are only a few applicants, your prizes will skyrocket."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this mart and you tell yourself that you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte said.
This contract, granted to the consortium "Énergie gérance", is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, which were granted to companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts in itself, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783 344, including the $295,131,564 Énergie gérance contract.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known to the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had suggested that the PQ was equally linked to the companies they "financed" before specifying that it was rather their managers.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The "green" label is not a source of confidence
Greener, but unturned skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but neither does he have any confidence in the branded brands or eco-labels that will guide his choice.
It is a pity, even though it is bathed in a media-efficient universe, where it is teeming with information in favour of more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information, an inadequacy identified as a brake on its commitment, as demonstrated by the first reading held yesterday.
Although they pushed the consumption of the so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of the Quebec population admits that they do not believe the environmental commitment of the companies as much as the green corporate advertising, so reveals the instrument of measurement sophisticated by the responsible consumer center of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates added to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
According to the same pattern, only 14.6% of the Quebec population take the politicians' discourse on this issue seriously.
However, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently being stimulated by nearly one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, emptiness and dubious character of information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are suspicious of the stated performance of the green products and services they are trying to provide.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products in order to express their conviction.
According to the Barometer, they also preferred 61% purchases from traders in their neighbourhood and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption this year had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 - the Homo consumer of Quebec loves to present himself as king of recycling, who tries to reduce his traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
However, the social and ecological awareness seems to stop at his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have stated that in 2010 they used public transport or preferred the carpooling centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds on stereotypes.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was requested by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois-owned cinema complex eXcentris on Boulevard Saint-Laurent, in order to hand it back to its actual cinematic function, apparently did not receive what they demanded.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a bond at a lower level than initially hoped, which could create a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of the sources extracted from the state rumor kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, and the request for petition has been summarily corrected downwards since then.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who is in charge of the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final report.
However, the counter-proposal of the cabinet was forwarded to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to reply to this.
In any case, the premise of the state donation seems to have really been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec ownership community of cinemas and cinema complexes had rebelled against a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture did not provide financial assistance for real estate projects there, which he did not also send to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial economic assistance.
Cinema director Daniel Langlois had presented the cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for more than ten years under great difficulties after the self-financed construction of the cinema, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clientele at bay.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are heading for a privately funded Campagne, which they hope will be worth $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvoi's "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not recall the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the downward-corrected proposals made to them.
Mystery of Complex Shaken Canada Revealed
The new American diplomatic lines spread by WikiLeaks reveal the secret of what the United Nations considers to be inferior to the Americans under the Canadians’ inferiority complex, but they reveal the latter’s sense of superiority to Canada with the same blow.
As a result, American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind when voting, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government to enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicized yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere substantial content to nibble at.
A connection dating from 22 September 2008, i.e. in the period during which the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports from which point the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador appointed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"A complex of inferiority that is almost inherent in the Canadians may lead Canadian political leaders much more to talk about internal issues of everyday life than to blame the United States for this election (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too menacing to speak of it".
The ambassador understands this "dark silence" even less, since the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
"Logically," he says, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor in the ballot."
The other expression of this sense of importance is set out in the communication sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, a commercial agent in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the continued existence of the government in the vote of confidence about the federal budget at the beginning of February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which was created by a 30 to 40 billion dollar recovery program," says Breese.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and that the continued existence of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed revival programme.
Another message from Ambassador Wilkins dating from January 2008 tells Washington about the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast via CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle allusions to Maher Aar, the "No-Fly-List" or even deductions for the purpose of interrogations carried out by the CIA's muscle spree can be observed.
Another communication reports in detail on how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was prepared to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question yes, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed the State Secretary a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has agreed to review the file again."
Finally, let's note that the moods are heating up with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close adviser, had told CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He had lectured here on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan for the renewal of lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (CFCs), equivalent to nearly a third of the additional reduction that needs to be implemented in order to stabilise the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete large-scale projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments from developed countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFC emitted by lighting on the earth if the white-burning pears, which are still a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better still, light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the worldwide fleet.
Last year, in Copenhagen, major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt would still have to be deducted from this balance sheet in order to stabilise the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white-burning bulbs 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced once again by two times.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched this week by the manufacturer Philips - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-burning bulb, which gives an indication of the savings of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that this completely new light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and therefore they have to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the producers provide a point of acceptance.
According to the report, however, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-burning pears.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would make thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save one billion dollars annually on the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, the construction of which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election immediately after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent election commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," stressed a press spokesman of the UN chief.
"It invites all parties and institutions of Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the election commission had missed the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday numerous calls from all over the world were made that the CEI should finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of the election under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, expects the Constitutional Council to cancel the "fraudy" votes in the north achieved by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Côte d'Ivoire presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN's maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo’s actions are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo opponents are now more of the opinion that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the North who denies any connection with the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in declaring the election results as "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to demand victory.
His coalition parties affirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results, knowing that he has lost; and file a complaint before the Constitutional Court, after preventing the election commission from publishing the results, would be illegal.
The second round of Sunday's presidential elections were held to be the culmination of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned Ivory Coast politicians that they could be held responsible for any riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had won the first round on 31 October with 38% of the vote against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who had the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a leading candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is stable in the sense of the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis at 9.3% (including overseas departments at 9.7%), as shown by the provisional, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office (Statistical Office) Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is established at 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the participation of the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage points.
More broadly, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find work, including whether they were able to work every two weeks or not, or whether they were seeking work or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% with the participation of overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged between 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the ILO.
For its part, seniors have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolitan area (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of those over 50 years of age, 6.6% including overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year-olds had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage points over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a debate on its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
An investigation was initiated against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), and he was sent to the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public markets suspected of fraud.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of embezzlement of social assets, embezzlement of common goods, stealing, complicity in corruption, illicit bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to speak out on all the questions that the prosecution will ask him instead of spreading fantasies."
"It is easy to subject him to a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," explained his lawyer Florence Rault to the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had insisted on giving the judge a memoradium to justify him before his hearing by means of his lawyers.
A relative of Guérini's, Philippe Rapezzi, was also indicted and detained on Wednesday night.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill, which he had to run, running.
Simon said that he would never have been aware of the area of business competence or of the destination of the associated funds.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Aubagne Public Service, was also charged on Wednesday for embezzlement and complicity, but then released under judicial supervision from the protagonists of these acts.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts he was accused of."
"The senior prosecutor has considered not to deprive him of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four others had been charged and released from prison on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) disposal company, is prosecuted for "unauthorized influence and passive bribery".
Two civil servants of the Aubagne conurbation, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the grounds of the title "Hidriness and embezzlement of common property by a public service officer", the other on the grounds of "complicity in embezzlement of public funds".
The life partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "smelting and embezzling social assets".
Among the people who were confronted with Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of public-sector fraud that affected Corsica.
The suspects suspect his society to have helped wash money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste management sector, will be conducted in April 2009 following anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation proceedings.
It is apparent from close investigation sources that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the contract and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also covers waste from the Aubagne area as well as from certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its intermediary function for Syria
In more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "spionage," kept the French public in the air, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the attentive gaze of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents preserved by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some of the background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give these advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "ghosting" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They point out how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman does not have the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and sought by the American judiciary on the basis of trade in material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they highlight the way in which the French Presidium has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making them believe the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French commentaries on the way hostage-taking is handled".
François Richier, Elysée consultant on strategic issues, spoke with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to do all they could to bring back their own nationals who would be forcibly detained in Iran.
"Makes noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without ceasing" the words "fundamental human rights," "innocent," "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians ask you not to do this."
Because "silence does not solve anything", the discussion attempts about inconspicuous ways pass, the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "common, Iranian tactic": "aggression for the purpose of political blackmail."
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due to take place on August 16th, the day she flees to the French Embassy) "requires payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros deposit).
And he states that the Elysée anticipates further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will intensify".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
One information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from custody after a judge in Paris has ruled.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, raises questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news for Washington, which is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks of acquiring the material intended for the nuclear program.
Has France accepted a cow trade ?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French woman?
On the occasion of another meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under the "stricter" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant dials a phone number, puts it back on, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "is currently in the buildings run by the Iranian embassy in Paris".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential mediator role" by means of statements and media-organised "fighting attempts".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and note that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dating from 25 August 2009 conjures up "the media flash of the French authorities".
On what is so much "thank you" to Mr Assad, the Paris embassy wonders.
"Despite their declarations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons which led the Elysée to fall victim to this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "are aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008 that was "premature and undeservedly perceived by numerous critics in France and abroad".
"Building up the Syrian role" Paris "is trying to show Syria what commendation one can achieve by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow discord between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier had entrusted her: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything".
"But we thanked them despite everything."
"This should at least create confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "the Cinderella", which will forbid youths to play online games after midnight by blocking access to them, so government leaders hinted.
A bill to encourage online gaming operators to deny young people under 16 years of age access to these games after midnight will be presented to the parliament in December, describing representatives of religious and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning at school and also having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games were then again accessible from 6 a.m.
The producer companies would have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also takes note of asking manufacturers to reduce the time limit granted daily for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask, the person responsible added.
He would also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals against 58 other nations in the World Cyber Games.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the host country
On Thursday, the Executive Committee of FIFA will appoint the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Championships, a highly political election in which the maneuvering for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
But one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be a little more exotic; the International Football Federation hopes to win new territories (Cat., Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) sets the measure of the economic and political commitment of a world championship.
The machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the evaluation report of FIFA, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) file offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important to the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations of the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have just as well ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to host the World Cup once, in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC had once again given it a breeding ground by broadcasting a documentary report that was being bombarded by three influential members of the committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the English leaders who have been lobbying intensively with David Cameron in the last few weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the move made by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be enough to revalue the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack any trumps with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, European Championship 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which has become a weighty outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport).
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to denounce the unwavering intimation of the accusations of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the committee members.
"You throw dirt at them, you try to compromise them," Putin bet.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
First world economic power, seat of the FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
But these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that had co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA’s eagerly awaited approval of the World Cup 2026 for China, which makes the Asian chances of 2022 obsolete.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the stops with the maintenance of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time lag) acquired by European countries, the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: public awareness
De Gaulle had really cut it.
Mitterand had made him think he was cutting.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obviousness is not well on the side of the mystery that clings to the presidency function.
So you have to pretend as if there were doubts from now on.
On the one hand, and on the other.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac's supporters claimed that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in earnest that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that on Tuesday evening at the Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians he would echo the perspective of "two mandates" had thus spread a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President merely reminded that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms of office to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he has mentioned the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"At worst, you still have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
To a new one in May 2010: "Don't think that I don't think about the phase afterwards."
His words from the day before yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before; but also no less.
If they make comments, it's for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for candidacy with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the entry of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012 that many members of the PS exhort to fight more early than assumed.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express poll).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion about it with the UMP," responded immediately and cautiously the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he found defeat possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin says.
"He will always believe in winning," corrects Alain Juppé, who has reconciled himself with the obvious.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the ECB’s Central Bank Council last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to come to an end at the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt obliges that the central bank in Frankfurt cannot without a doubt afford to put an end to the current, more than tense situation on the European bond markets in order not to cause their worsening.
The political costs would be far too high.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in solving Europe's public debt.
It has not dared to say whether it believes that the central bank can do even more, for example by stimulating its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) ".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB in Brussels the day before, during his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, had not shown himself to be very eloquent about his intentions, but was content to point out that the programme of purchases of government documents on the secondary market would "continue" and that we will "see what decisions are made" at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases of the Treasury were doubled from the ECB last week to approximately 1.35 billion euros.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, it is said to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among traders, there is no doubt about the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase price (see page 29).
The economists no longer expect a remarkable change in course.
If the bond transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB will still have to cope with the unlimited reserves of funds in a generous way, over a period of one week to three months.
The economists are already counting on this measure to be extended by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially change its programme."
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of triggering new tensions in the short term," suspects Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems to me more likely," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the sovereign debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of bonds that will stimulate the sluggish market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in euro area sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must replace the lack of investors on the market at any price and act in such a way as to prevent the hasty enthusiasm for the returns paid to the weakest countries," testified a major bondholder yesterday.
If interest rates were to rise, states would be even more prevented from reducing or even stabilising their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government is taking cover in Italy
After a week's start, which is worrying for Italy, yesterday's situation eased somewhat with the fall in corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional president Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indecipherable" and heard him expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which the person immediately denied.
On Tuesday, at any rate, the German interest rate scissors would have reached their record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts covering the risk of bankruptcy had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that the gap between Spain and German interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as "seriously concerned" about the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain terms, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, dizzying tax revenue that puts the state at risk of being unable to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to grow by 1.1% in 2011 and by 1.4% in 2012... although the budget available for examination at the Senate is expected to grow by 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will remain 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (rather than 2.7%).
Hence the turmoil over a new household collective, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says accountant Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving support from international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, we have been repeating this for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as Italy, despite its high level of debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.D.R.), is calling for lower stabilization progress than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question of political unsteadiness remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure from the Chamber of Deputies, which would allow the early elections to be organised as early as the end of March.
So there is a little time to decide on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde made it clear yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I believe that it was still proved on Sunday afternoon and also in the evening: Europeans clearly stick together, are willing and committed to defend their currency and their currency area".
Although completely relative - the deduction recorded yesterday in the interest rate feet of European state bonds was water on the mills of governments as well as the ECB.
However, it is not yet possible to speak of a start to normalisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt note, probably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly relevant to the banking systems," says the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially since "the political time passes much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger it poses, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already in place.
The informal discussions between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, in a broader sense, with their counterparts in the G20 are progressing well.
This also applies to the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the plan is the lot of unconventional measures to back up the eurozone countries in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU stability funds are concerned, its Executive Director Klaus Regling started his Asia tour in Singapour on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for it.
The EU Stability Fund's first spending on securities is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative entrusted Reuters with the agency, and the United States supported a possible increase in the funds mobilised by the IMF's additional direct involvement.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first row, are preparing to undertake structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are added to the austerity measures but are intended to have effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are taking a different path than Greece and Ireland have.
Both the one and the other have to avoid having to ask for international assistance at all costs before they have set up their own budget correctives and decided on inevitable structural reforms that will bring them back trust in the long term.
European investors, in turn, talk about the options available to speed up the normalisation process of sovereign bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was passing through Paris on 24 November, was the first to come up with the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take up its own pockets again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a player in the forefront of the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means exists: the European mechanism of financial stabilisation, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board that has every chance to be scrutinised carefully in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are increasing.
Snow and ice: 24 départements in Alarm Level Orange
Snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, particularly in Brittany's secondary transport networks, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in alert level orange due to the imminent risk of snow and ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in the Orange alert; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers touch the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow blankets from 2 to 5 cm, sometimes from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region are expected.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic disruptions and to affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using their own vehicle only in case of emergency, and the use of some TER coaches has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requires drivers to be extremely careful on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights departing from Orly from Roissy airport and 10% from Orly on Thursday due to the expected heavy snowfalls.
DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airport in southern London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport sector at Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
The 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, is remembered in particular.
In order to initiate the construction of the SGP, the state has declared a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum which the SGP would then allow to lend part of the total on the markets to double.
Today, first projections have finally come to light.
The 2010 supplementary budget, this morning reviewed by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax on the opening and closing up and a higher taxation of the offices in Ile-de-France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "to the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
The figure is: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganization of existing corporate taxation: "to modernise it in order to increase the product resulting from it and to pass on this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not quantified in the text.
You're a long way from the four billion.
"It is said that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of capital invested by the State and gradually paid to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the explanatory statement states.
With the SGP you find this system not offensive.
"Since the moment one records revenue (the two taxes, i.e.) one can cover the project over three years and then draw only from the 4 billion", it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will start to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, of which 4 billion will be possible for a long time to come, is in danger of creating a fairly moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and busy spies
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a dual meaning.
On one side it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go one by one.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that any file created by an intelligence agency (any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits throw nothing more than what was read over months in any journal anyway (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the horribly caricatured profile of Gaddafi had long been offering cabaret artists material for their sketches.
The rule according to which secret dossiers may only consist of news already known is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to Esothermal publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (or because he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
The same goes for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example editor at Libération), who considers only what he acknowledges to be true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department was the same as those that Newsweek had already published the week before.
So why has such a fuss been made about the revelations of these dossiers?
On one side they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into espionage centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-any hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world holds the considerable blow against the prestige of the state department.
Moreover, the scandal puts less of the victims than the "sharpeners" into distress.
But let us devote ourselves to the profound nature of what happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's time, all power could be bundled like a Big Brother controlling every gesture of his subjects.
Since then Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if one considers what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control process ceases to be one-sided and becomes circle-shaped.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the citizen's avenger - can discover the secrets of power.
But how can a power hold itself that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secret because it reveals the public sphere; but to disclose in the style of WikiLeaks that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to deprive them of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama did.
What will be the consequences of this insult inflicted on such a tremendous power?
It is obvious that in the future the states will no longer place any reserved information online - this would be like a hanging on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is in vain with the current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports secret over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships be maintained in the future, only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I feel compelled to imagine the government agents, moving in secret on uncontrollable marches, carrying their messages nowhere else but in mere memory, and also hiding the few written information they have received in the heels of their shoes.
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, Watergate's espionage attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like cancer these days, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogous) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band for band by reeling from back to front and uncovering all the secrets of montage, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
The high-speed trains will take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this will take you three and a half hours by plane, including transfer.
It is therefore not unusual that politics and communication technology come back to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present, it is the embassies that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France brightens up its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to look at the fast-moving financing promises (also called "fast start" or early funding) that have been made by developing countries.
And already the rough French fine speeches are revealed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of the fact of their commitment to fast-start financing: detailed progress report of their Member States, press conference, major side events, leaflet distribution.
The transparency operation is remarkable and highly valued for its real value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it will have released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right track to pay tribute to its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional effort has been made without being detrimental to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark that they consider best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen itself as the benchmark for 2009: international financing will be maintained and will add 150 million over three years to the "fast start" funding.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or in terms of ODA conditions.
In return, France felt that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no indicative figures for expenditure in the previous year or at the global level of official development assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support to developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France claims to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about that yet, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, have €1 borrowed as equivalent to €1 donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often emission-reducing projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro as the equivalent of a donated euro... Moreover, only the cost of the loan to the investor country should be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in mind than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5% 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself of this.
France is the only country in the EU that uses large amounts of loans.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) carry out 100% of their commitments with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to fulfil its obligations, France gives just 10 cents, meaning a comparable commitment.
Nice hocus pocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double swindle: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of financial commitment.
France succeeds in making it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in line with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a double negative effect; once within the EU (why do the other member states continue with the donation, if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of premature financing only a small question for a relatively short time compared to the totality of discussions on the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of early financing.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its method of accounting for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring forward discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another, crucial and currently discussed issue): one cannot escape the question of "predictability" or the method of recording its loans.
France could change its position to be as progressive as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France's fast-start and its vision of "predictability" and the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years of age takes 81 different chemical substances over the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Générations Futures (Former Movement for the Protection of the Rights and Respect of Coming Generations).
The association, which explains that its results "in view of the small number of samples analysed do not reflect a statistically significant value, but rather represent an illustration of the problem dealt with", had bought between July and September the food usually consumed by a child of about ten years of age at meals, plus a snack in supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were investigated, as were laboratory snacks looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is devastating: 81 chemical substances, among them 42 classified as potentially or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safe carciogen, as well as 37 substances with endocrinine interference factor, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if in the approximate totality of the cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded, this survey is very well understood that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrinine disturbance factor is worrying," the association notes.
Already at breakfast, butter and tea containing milk alone already contain more than ten of the possibly carcinogenic residues and three have been shown to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the hacksteak, the tuna from the can, even the baguette and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were sprinkled.
In tap water, the analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 identified chemical residues was the "most abundant" and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "harmful cocktail" for the consumer is probably "undervalued", the study says.
In turn, the Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in diseases of civilisation".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on the presence of residues identified 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
