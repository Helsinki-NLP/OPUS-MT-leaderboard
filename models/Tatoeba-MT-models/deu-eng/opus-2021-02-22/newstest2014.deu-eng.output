Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters apart: On Tuesday in Gutach the new B 33 pedestrian light was put into operation at the village parking lot - within sight of the older town hall lamp.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or shield-bürgerstreich?
Gutach's mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
"The town hall lamp was installed at the time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser-Ampel secure both cyclists as well as bus passengers and the Bergle-inhabitants.
The plant officially put into operation yesterday was important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße intersection area.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"With the high traffic and pedestrian volumes, another traffic light had to be provided for their safety," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the District Office of Offenburg.
"According to current measurements, around 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33 every day, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty traffic," says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of a further traffic light is more than necessary: "Security is simple here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out, a roundabout was also planned, but due to the narrowness in the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße again rejected.
According to Arnold, everything was tested before when the traffic lights were selected: "By means of a transporter loaded with particularly long logs, we have tested whether these vehicles can leave the Sulzbachweg on the B 33 without turning the traffic lights."
The traffic light system itself, which costs around 15 000 euros, is "the most modern thing that is currently available on the market," Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs, which glow so strongly that the lights of the motorists can be easily recognized, for example, even in low sun.
And it is also economical: The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: It is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian pushes the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, comes immediately green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
"If a group or people with reduced mobility cross the street, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will safely cross the road," Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver has to think along as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: barely the traffic light showed green for pedestrians, an upper-class vehicle ran through - with bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth for more than 30 years.
The Carinthian poet has often described the catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - speechlessness, a tendency to raw violence and dull sexuality, narrowness and lack of joy.
The Büchner Prize winner is mainly known as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher therefore composes a collage of prose texts for his performance "Weather lights on the tip of the tongue", which can now be seen in Garage X at Petersplatz.
For example, the theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographically influenced novel "Der Leibserke" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important prop: a crumpled sofa, on which a hint of copulation and masturbating is made - the eight-member ensemble shuffles through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the text.
The 70-minute performance covers the original with a plethora of directing ideas, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses get to the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, with their heads dipped under water, with their evening robes stacked against the wall.
Constricted to cellophane or bodice, they stagger through the production on dangerously high sticks, either monologize them loudly or lie completely silently on the stage floor.
However, the text does not convey itself in this strenuous way.
The evening has the best moments when singing - the bandwidth ranges from deep purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end does the overturned performance come to rest, and Winkler's absurd humour flashes up.
A black box in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in the dashboard of each car.
The devices that record every kilometer driven and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and are in favour of the government using the small boxes to record the kilometres driven – and possibly where they were driven – and then using the information to calculate tax rulings.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The US Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing that we're just going to use," said Hasan Ikhrata, CEO of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles driven by all California motorists in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is here.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by the taxes paid by Americans at the pump, is bankrupt.
But America doesn't have as much gas as it used to be.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by one cent at high fuel prices.
"The fuel tax is simply not sustainable," says Lee Munnich, an expert in traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most sensible option in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is well received by urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
The California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state's ambitious, legally anchored climate change goals.
However, Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also delighted with the idea of having drivers pay for the journey.
"This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Reason's Directives.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who, in a 2011 report, called on Congress to move towards mile-based billing.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move, responding to the concerns of rural MPs who represent people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Several states and major cities are nevertheless moving in this direction on their own.
Oregon, which is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment, is the most committed.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transportation ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, motorists were skeptical of the idea that the government could pursue any of their movements.
"Thoughts against Big Brother and such things were a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Outcome Management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult surveillance devices."
There was no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to track the miles travelled, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, Khan said, the public would also be more reassured.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not start to help states tax motorists.
Rather, it was their goal to gain a foothold in an emerging market for motor insurance, where drivers are supposed to pay based on the miles driven.
However, the devices tested by her are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which are regularly uploaded by modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programmes, major mistakes have been made.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment with giving drivers a number of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any equipment at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee based on the average miles driven by all residents of the state.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a tax-paying device that can also pay parking fees, pay insurance only for miles driven, and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time, allowing drivers to avoid traffic jams.
"Car drivers are motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," says a city planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials stated that Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or annual charge could be imposed on drivers using hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they too pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, Head of Legislation and Public Affairs of the Commission.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team beats its feet
Despite a shortage of personnel, the volunteer fire brigade mastered its main autumn test with flying colors.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate Feder in Burgberger Straße in his practice acceptance.
A short circuit is said to have occurred during sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke, but one of them was still able to send an emergency call.
After the first examination of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two respiratory protectors of the Wehr prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead him out into the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as even a narrow staircase was to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw bales in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was made via an overfloor hydrant at a distance of about 100 metres.
Now three firefighting attacks could be designed.
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also interested in showing what can be done with little available staff.
In the event of an emergency, support is provided via the day operations group Königsfeld.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, Landtag President Guido Wolf also had the opportunity to clarify where the workers of tomorrow come from in Titisee-Neustadt.
At the Hochschwarzwald funding centre, he studied this important issue together with the managing school heads of vocational schools, the district grammar school and the parents' advisory board chairmen.
"Education is an important location factor," underlined Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans Thomas School, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre, the district grammar school and the vocational school centre.
He also praised the family friendliness in the county.
"It is important not only to look at the family phase, but also the phase of caring for family members due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
He also said that more and more employees were taking care of the care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one can afford to lose a skilled workforce, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies often retain the regional economy with their acquired knowledge and skills, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the President of the Landtag was convinced.
Only if sufficient training places were offered can the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its favourable location in the southwest of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
On his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made for the expansion of public transport.
"Keep stubborn and ensure that public transport gets better," he said to the local politicians present.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and then to a Vesper.
In the past, the older citizens were served in the restaurant.
Meanwhile this afternoon takes place in the nursing home St. Josef.
The residents looked forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with popular melodies.
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front delimitation of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, which stands before the renovation, is to be once again included on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angular wall was installed in the first works of the renovation of the front schoolyard, for the stabilization and static relief of the over one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlingen City Building Office, the further procedure provides for including the State Monuments Office in the planning and to create a refurbishment concept for the old wall.
Thereafter, a cost calculation will be carried out by experts, which will then be put on the table of the municipal council for the decision and determination of the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be taken next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, the need for renovation of the boundary wall has to be renovated from the ground up and placed on a new base in the foreseeable future.
The historical, one hundred-year-old wall of the old schoolyard to the Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since no drainage is available, needs renovation and has an inclination towards the front.
Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence of weather damage, but the wall is currently not at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the pupils to use schoolyard, which was done by the current fortification works.
Originally, the schoolyard renovation was already planned in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditure brought a shift.
An important word in the historical renovation of the school wall, which has even been used for filming, will be spoken by the State Monument Office.
Should regulations come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for subsidies from the monument keepers.
The pupils of the Bräunlingen primary school, who are now again taught in a well-renovated old school building with a new auditorium, can soon use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Green Party, has now also been involved in the ongoing discussions about the future of the music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it's wrong to give up the holistic training at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart," said Özdemir in the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz location Stuttgart.
Thus, Özdemir, who is considered a favourite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September in Stuttgart, contradicts the Green-Red government.
On the basis of an expert study, it is pushing for a reorganization of the five music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, the Jazz and Pop program will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
US border: "Super tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the US, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
According to the US customs authorities, the more than 500 metre long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
According to the data, the tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar," said the US attorney general of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
To the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in the context of drug crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated wagons could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters deep to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters width.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the seized marijuana.
All three are threatened with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, as officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, the press conference in San Diego continued.
However, it was the first time cocaine was found in such tunnel construction.
Usually cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes are now cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug investigation in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were given about the detainees, at least one of them was Mexican, they said.
You have to expect up to ten years of imprisonment.
2014 will be Geisinger Festjahr
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
Return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year comes to an end in just over eight weeks, the anniversary year is due.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were mentioned together for the first time in 794.
In churches a document was produced, in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this kick-off event will take place in Kirchen-Hausen, where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago.
As part of the anniversary, a number of events are planned in Geisingen as well as in Kirchen-Hausen.
Kirchen-Hausen will be 1250 in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this festive weekend is also the Kirchen-Hausener Kirchenfest.
Stadtmusikdirektor Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June, together with the Sonnwendfeier of the Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new festival hall.
This is finished and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on September 27th and 28th.
On the occasion of the Geisinger Stadtjubiläum, a new chronicle will also be published.
"However, it should not only be a chronicle by Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the geising of today, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And the geising of today also celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 the present space was completed with the incorporations.
The new chronicle will be presented in the new festival hall in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November.
2014 is also another year with many anniversaries.
The fool guild Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, harmony Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has a banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger school has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10, the music club Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this during the fountain festival from July 4 to 7.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a document of donation, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The certificate was made in churches (houses), which was then a court place.
Both congregations are therefore mentioned in the same document.
The reason to celebrate this 1250-year-old in 2014 is that the municipal reform is also 40 years ago.
Council targets track installations
Should the level crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively converted to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the councillors have decided.
Schiltach has to take 220 000 euros in his hand.
Deutsche Bahn plans to improve the Kinzigtal line next year.
In particular, safety at level crossings is to be increased - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles throughout Germany.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they have to contribute with one third to the costs, the rest are shared by the railway and the federal government.
Schiltach's master builder Roland Grießhaber explained the peculiarities of the Bahübergang "Am Hirschen" to the municipal council.
There the city plans to build a bulge at the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway track.
Larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, could also be on the other side of the road without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp summed up the critics' mood with his statement: "Do we have to take care of so much money because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for longwood transports.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" is partly transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberles Bridge, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, Haas argued that the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed.
Since it can be expected that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to have the costs of the planned widening of the road investigated.
In spite of this, the majority of the majority agreed to the conversion of the railway crossing, provided that the necessary retaining wall was built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" to around 5.5 metres for meeting traffic, if necessary.
The conversion of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery, on the other hand, could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns the access to the strongly rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had had the plans for the conversion of the railway examined by the engineering office Breinlinger, as it had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg was then easily possible.
The investigation concluded that it cannot be excluded that the slope conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting on.
The city, in turn, bears responsibility for this as a road load carrier.
The conversion could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Haas argued that since both the wood removal and the bending function worked in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the conversion of the level crossing.
At this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the crossing is also significantly lower than at the other level crossings, because the centre stop is directly adjacent to which a good visual link exists.
Even trains from the central station would have to be slowed down to such a point that no collision would threaten.
In the majority of cases, approval of the conversion of this railway crossing was refused, as the city of Schiltach would have to "bath out" the problem with mounted vehicles, according to the councillors, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The panel considers the conversions at the level crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" as unproblematic, for which crossing agreements with the railway have already been made.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to launch in the coming years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Far-off worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets in other stars.
No one knows whether there is life on at least some of them.
The choice is difficult: Should you look for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for earthlike planets, perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These are the questions that the European space agency Esa is in charge of.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to make research a decisive step forward.
The budget for such "L-Missions" is about one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were on the table, five of them have now been shortlisted.
Numerous bodies examine the proposals, check with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.
The Esa has selected a total of four major questions to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme, initiated in 2007, will find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes involved in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to investigate this question, the space telescope "Cheops" will be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity will be examined in more detail.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, is ultimately intended to shed light on the conditions that exist for the emergence of life.
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation it emits with the planetary system play an important role.
These processes can be investigated exemplarily in our solar system.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved an M-Class mission (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and observe the sun's surface and activity closely.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa provides for the first of the three L-missions of the Cosmic Vision programme.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later it reaches Jupiter and is supposed to investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europe, Kallisto and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
Space offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could show physicists the way to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter we are familiar with, which consists of stars, planets and living beings like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, which accelerates the expansion of the universe.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", the Esa has already approved an M-Mission, which is scheduled to start in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will be left at the end of the selection procedure.
According to many experts, the best chances of obtaining an L-mission are "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
Physicists mean changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission consists of a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.
In contrast to installations on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that arose during the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the emergence of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to detect and investigate earth-like planets.
Proposals for sample transport from Mars, the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids as well as solar physics have already been eliminated.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany in relation to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the US intelligence service, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he received asylum to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: "Even though the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissent as a breach of loyalty and tries to criminalise political expression with a threat of punishment in which no defence is possible."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, we will find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has intercepted Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence, said that the opportunity should be taken to listen to Snowden as a witness if this was possible 'without jeopardising him and ruining relations with the United States completely'.
Ströbele, a Green MEP, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
When Snowden speaks in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is "safe" there, the MP said.
Snowden explains in his letter that he was exposed to a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that drove him out of his home country.
However, he was touched by the global response to 'my act of political expression'.
Citizens around the world as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities an offer of cooperation "when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Frontier Airlines charges fees for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to 100 US dollars for passengers who wish to stow hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or lemonade, even if the announcement on Wednesday stated that passengers would be allowed to keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small pockets below the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier stated that if the fee is paid in advance, you will be charged $25 and $100 for travelers who paid at the gate.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate this sum," she explained.
In 2008, airlines began to charge charges for the first and second checked baggage.
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore stuffed as much as possible into their hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to get passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee wasn't really about making money.
It was about the most loyal customers of Frontier, who had clearly expressed that it was becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at the Frontier boarding gate may be allowed to take a piece of luggage free of charge, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a similar piece of luggage.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and check-in procedures were being changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they came to the gate.
Frontier's new cabin baggage charge will only enter into force in the summer, with no exact date yet.
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that the transport of luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street regard the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them, however, have so far left their fingers on hand luggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago and later Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airliner, followed.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that the Spirit hand luggage fee would raise $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what would await him at the gate if passengers were confronted with the company's unusual hand baggage charge.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothest I have experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see teeth gnashing and tangible discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding went smoothly."
Frontier also follows Spirit for the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice could keep the whole can and refill coffee for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed this seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company had moved in.
Frontiers Step to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to buy directly from them rather than via an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were again reduced to 25 percent of the flight distance.
Therefore, a trip with Frontier over 1000 miles booked with a third-party provider brings customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only for direct purchase on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue decreased by 9 percent and flight capacity shrunk almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to control Frontier's finances as part of the company's sale.
Proverbs come from the Bible
About 40 women visited the last breakfast of women this year in the Protestant parish of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the parish house were "languages from the Bible" and "languages from the Middle Ages".
After breakfast, Zita Köhler, chairman of the church council, addressed the biblical proverbs in a lecture.
"Speaking words contain wisdom, precepts, or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs like: Wood-eye be watchful, as scales fall from the eyes, cast an eye on one whose eyes the Lord gives in his sleep, wash his hands in innocence.
Several times the speaker also let her listeners guess which proverb it was.
The church councillor Christel Dehner took on the words of the Middle Ages: All good things are three, making blue, something screwed up.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called "bridges into the past".
Finally, a raffle was drawn.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round was also mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
Today, a pilot project for the tourism industry is being launched on the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who already work as unskilled people in the industry will be qualified to become specialists for hotels and restaurants over the course of three winters.
"What's new is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg employment agency.
The benefits were manifold: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would have trained specialists who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA states that an "internal error" and not hackers are to blame for the website crash
The shadowy National Security Agency declared late Friday that a mistake had crippled its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update," explained the spy agency in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early hours of the evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and that this is still not available to some users.
Previously, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the agency was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, the speaker said.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency (No such authority), is now in the bright light of the public and is facing fierce criticism after the revelations about its extensive monitoring program in Germany and abroad that have become known in recent months – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over the secret service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of people without a job fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the rate was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we had hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Head of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Many companies have so far reacted cautiously to recruitment.
According to Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is: "We have hardly any skilled workers in the crafts, health care and care of the elderly".
As a result of the seasons, vacancies for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been open again since September.
The winter season begins there in mid-December.

Profit losses for Bombardier after decline in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decline in net profit on Thursday after being under pressure from declining orders and deliveries to aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railway division.
Also, Montreal-based Bombardier did not publish flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft could enter commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule for next September.
Only three more take-offs followed the maiden flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago, which makes it questionable whether the test phase will proceed as planned.
The results fell short of the forecasts and led to a price fall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered its valuation from "outperform" to "sector perform" on Thursday with a view to the stock having a limited price potential over the next one to two quarters.
"We were expected to see weaker deliveries from aircraft, but we are clearly disappointed by the development of margins in the transport sector," Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft will be able to catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced to the public in March and flew in September for the first time after months of delays.
But so far binding orders for the CSeries are moderate at 177, as potential buyers want to wait for the results of the flight tests and see if the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet airliner are true.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
The management also assured analysts and media that the program was in the schedule on Thursday.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground any longer than expected," Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft's service life.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period, which we have also done.
This happens throughout the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the rest shortly after, it was said from the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical as to whether the first customer can commission a CSeries aircraft twelve months after the maiden flight.
Bombardier said it was reviewing the planning for commissioning (EIS) and would update it in the coming months.
"The slow progress of the flight test – even if it appears to be in line with Bombardier's internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is delayed to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, at the end of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, of $117 million, or 9 cents per share the previous year.
Adjusted earnings per share remain at 9 cents.
Sales fell slightly, falling from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected profit of 10 cents per share and sales of 4.56 billion dollars, says Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claims to have delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, a drop of 57 last year.
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Order backlog in the aerospace division amounted to $32.9 billion on 30 September, unchanged from 31 December.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were in line with our targets, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Revenue in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this segment rose by almost eleven percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
On 30 September, orders on hand in the transport sector amounted to $32.6 billion, slightly higher than on 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share fell by 8.5 percent and amounted to $4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that Google CFO Patrick Pichette will join the board of directors.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10% decline in quarterly profit on Thursday.
USA: Shots fired at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots at the LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management told Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security man had also been killed.
The media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama is kept informed of the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses claimed to have seen a shooter with a rifle in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveller told CNN that many people had panicked and sought protection.
Travelers would cry and children would cry.
Panic has erupted among those waiting, many of them hiding behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler of the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the security agency TSA suffered a gunshot wound on the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie".
After that, he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots were reported to have fallen near a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
On television pictures, there were numerous ambulances and police cars in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken out of the building to safety.
Users posted on Twitter photos of a Special Operations Command and a rifle lying on the ground.
According to the airport management via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were closed, resulting in long backlogs, according to CNN.
Except for landings, air traffic had been temporarily stopped, they said.
However, several pilots were also observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation must go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed information to underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash", was arrested in his home in 2011 after the police had monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a bar dinner.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain illegal information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were monitored by the police during a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and £200,000 in cash during a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Forbes Solicitors law firm in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts for obstruction of justice.
He admitted cocaine possession in a previous interview.
The lawyer was convicted after the police found out in their investigation of Scarborough that he had been in regular contact with Ditta by telephone in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs under the lawyer's garbage can with 60 percent purity in a black golf glove.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough made regular calls to Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park for dinner.
The lawyer returned home, took the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it became known that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests revealed Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied taking cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client and claimed that their discussion was subject to the 'lawyer's secret'.
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he was running an office under his private address as well as at the workplace, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it became known that he had called on important actors in drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed them of what the investigators knew about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don't break the law."
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender because he has been too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these persons.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta rejected any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but do so immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead from the Lancashire police said: "Mr. Ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal the moment he started acquiring drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to entrenched himself behind the façade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases of possession of cocaine and judicial disability, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he declared guilty of the conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total sentence of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer, that his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two divine services with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which thrilled the audience this spring, the Liederkranz will enrich two divine services with the performance of the Deutsche Messe by Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary mass will be held from 19 during the evening Mass in the St. Martinus Church Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 a.m. at the divine service in the St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Songs for the Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass will be performed as part of the divine services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism gives way to increasing confidence
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, the pastoral care unit Haslach (SE) will change fundamentally.
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
For the fundamental decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the skepticism towards the new is hesitant but increasingly giving way to confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals about the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the chief officials of the pastoral team were sufficient.
On the basis of a presentation, regional dean Georg Schmitt explained the revised guidelines for pastoral units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
After that, the SE Haslach as a parish will form a body under public law, which will enter into the rights and obligations of the six individual parishes so far.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council in which the pastor Kraft is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, and so-called community teams are to be formed in the six parishes on site.
In the future, it will be their task to promote local ecclesial life.
The question of the finances of the individual parish then showed considerable need for discussion.
The innovations foresee that accumulated funds in the parishes will be retained for specific purposes.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the entire municipality.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, the commitment of which then all parishes meet, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, investments were only made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," said Haslach's parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint committee for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chair of the committee in the pastoral unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had set themselves the task of "becoming one, staying five" in 2006 and had to realize that this is not so easy.
The bodies of the Haslach pastoral unit then set out to answer questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be fleshed out in further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, the parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adapt to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, an additional cost of 70 to 90 euros per year is due to a four-person Pfullendorf family.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is rescheduled each year in October by the four operators of the large power lines.
These quantify the additional costs they incur from the energy transition, which they can levy via a levy on the electricity price.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf are the last link in this chain.
According to Jörg-Arne Bias, the Supervisory Board of the energy company had even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts.
Now the concrete numbers would have to be calculated before the municipal utilities could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x", says Bias, with the number being closer to the 2 cents.
Traffic light on permanent red: pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the road does not react, or the light sign is defective.
Then what should you do - drive in red?
If an affected person has waited long enough at a red traffic light and the intersection is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting period must be "adequate", which can be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises to endure for at least five minutes before a malfunction of the traffic light is expected.
However, anyone who continues the journey despite red light must be aware that he is entirely responsible for an accident caused by it.
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to an order of the Oberlandesgericht Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not broken, but later switched to green.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but the fine was not.
Municipal Council welcomes sound budget
Every time council meetings are about the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal office in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debts have not been known to the administration since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be recorded as a complete success in this respect.
This became clear in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget was more than one million euros higher than planned, with around 7.6 million euros.
The surplus of the administrative budget was also around one million euros higher than the approach, amounting to around 1.8 million euros.
The surplus was mainly due to higher business tax revenues and the municipal share of income tax.
The wealth budget was again well above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it amounted to 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher input from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As less investment was made in 2012 than planned, the provision of reserves was also higher.
Overall, the general reserve was increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a work like that out of your sleeve," Gerster praised with regard to the annual accounts.
He and the local councillors were visibly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost citizens a lot.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to forego high lifting rates in the past.
However, according to Gerster, this in turn has often reduced subsidies from the country.
These grants from various compensatory funds are subject to conditions.
Among other things, cities and municipalities applying for grants have to have certain rates of lift.
"We have to look at the issue of lifting rates, as investments are due in the coming years for which we would like to have subsidies," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
At the age of 60 as a singer, Hubert Wermter's story at the men's singing club Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, in which he was solemnly honoured.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his men's singing club.
Even after 60 years he still enjoys singing with the choir, which is now probably more than appreciated.
Wermter was also active in the club, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and his loyalty to the association: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Officer on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him with a certificate of association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst, as the choir is also a church choir.
His fellow singers handed him the certificate of the German choir association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the award, the 31st Autumn Festival was held in the usual lanes: with the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the Baisingen Singers' Section and the local music club, the Vollmaringer invited a colourful mixture of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".
To honour their honorary singer Hubert Wermter they prepared a little serenade - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing association Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song "When you go through the valley".
With his mixed choir and his women's group - the "impulse choir" - the Liederkranz Salzstetten ensured the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir, with the Neapolitan folk song "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus, abducted them to foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singers' section of the Baisinger Sportverein came back with "Was isch der Schwab?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" back to the home country, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories, which the children over the noon well occupied.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and day care centers in the Zollernalbkreis receive mail these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwälder Bote wants to support the facilities in the realisation of their building and beautification wishes.
Does kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day care centres and crèches from the whole Zollernalbkreis can participate in the action.
If you have a building or beautification request for your facility, you can apply with this at the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten construction site.
A jury consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb selects three wishes from all entries.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with construction material worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to take care of many hard-working construction workers.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and is then to be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
'We are in a frightening situation and we should ask ourselves: what prevents Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow', the newspaper which considers the draft law to be unconstitutional.
"The law is draconian and very criminal and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extended arm of the government" and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we call on him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government is using the new law to "effectively strangle the media", whereas The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have suffered "a severe blow" and called the draft "draconic".
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping center in September.
The Kenyan media provoked the anger of the authorities because they released footage of security cameras showing how the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robbed the luxury shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even if the subpoena was withdrawn after a media outcry.
According to the new law, media houses can be punished with up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single penalty can bankrupt most radio stations".
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's 'lifelike blogosphere'.
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with the nation who describes Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
"If politicians are left to themselves, they lead the country into bankruptcy and us back to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators have already caused public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and reinstated their low salaries of about 532,000 Schilling tax-free per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream comes true for the FC
Despite the cold weather and the rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial grass sports field lost nothing of its importance for the city and the football club.
Everyone had wished for a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play along.
Thus, all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold such one for some reason had the after-effect.
This was the case for the musicians who framed the ceremony, just like many speakers.
Wess became therefore also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfilment of a dream.
His main thanks were to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was very committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the participating companies and members of the association, who got involved.
Especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The grueling pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
Karl Rombach, a member of the state parliament, also praised this remarkable voluntary commitment.
Further greetings spoke for the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the club's youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn affected the original lawn in such a way that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago there were the first considerations for the solution of the problem, when the construction of a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the Realschule am Salinensee was thought.
Both were discarded again.
Six years ago, thoughts arose about creating an artificial turf sports field, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were started two years ago when FC took over the Schabelstube in Erblacht, promised a cost contribution of 100 000 euros for the construction of the square and the country approved funding of 104 000 euros.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356,000 from the total cost of EUR 560,000, summarised Klumpp.
The construction of the 68 by 108 meter artificial grass field began on 4 June.
During the construction phase lasting over three months, 3000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which was used for the installation of a dirt bike track.
The Union and the SPD continued their coalition negotiations on home affairs and justice.
In addition, the relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, bribery and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its work.
Among other things, this should be about dual citizenship, where both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to end the pressure for immigrant children born in Germany to opt for one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD supported its 'no' to a passenger car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flatrate for driving a lot and thus ecologically counterproductive", explained the SPD negotiator for the topic of traffic, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his faction.
Alternative traffic on rural roads was threatened, which were already the focus of accidents.
Moreover, the introduction of a toll for all passenger cars would only be a first step from the perspective of Pronolds.
"There is a danger that compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing Föhnwelle on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be summer again?" was not the question on Friday evening on the open-air stage Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.

Driver seriously injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old passenger car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on the way to Grefrath at around 9.15 p.m. with her car on the Kempen outer ring.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße, she overlooked the oncoming car of the 37-year-old.
The driving fence collided.
The Aachener suffered severe injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Locking after accident at the Schänzlekreisel
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m., on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left-hand lane towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right-hand lane.
This led to a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanzer.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old driving behind the BMW was also damaged.
A total of around 15,000 property damage was caused, the police reported.
The road had to be closed during the accident, they said.
Vienna Airport cancels passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
There will be no more announcements like this at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future.
A large part of the loudspeaker announcements are thus omitted - the noise level is to be reduced so significantly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
According to airport spokesman Peter Kleemann to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the cessation of announcements concerning individuals.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already giving up the noisy calls.
The removal of these announcements - on average, around 200 personal calls from the loudspeakers sound on one day - is intended to make things quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual announcements have been perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information on changed flight platforms or departure times is a little bit lost here," says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the braking car pull with tractors, there will be a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games start at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are Swabian-breathed on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and single combatants compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water bucket carrying.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It doesn't matter what the width is," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be thrown vertically, should roll over once and then come straight to lying down.
This is rated with the most points.
When throwing horseshoes, it depends on the accuracy of the target.
From a distance of eight meters, they throw at a stake.
The participants must demonstrate skill and strength in carrying water over 50 metres.
Time and amount of water in a vat are measured at the end.
Two from each "Clan" or team can then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competitions receive prizes.
Training can start at 10 a.m.
A suitable clothing is desired, for example, the competitors can compete in the Schottenrock.
But also Swabian costume is allowed.
For the "Outfit" the jury awards a few bonus points.
You can register up to an hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander-Games and the tractor-pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is already a lot of action on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, the brass music friends get their money's worth.
At 7 p.m., the Biraböhmic brass music from Schömberg is shaping the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fast polkas and marches.
Their repertoire also includes emotional waltzes and a rich big band sound.
The Heinz Koch from Weilen, known as the singing innkeeper and black sausage baron, will be present.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the fool guild.
On Sunday the music club Leinstetten entertains to the early morning, from 2 p.m. the Bauernkapelle Böffingen is a guest, and the "oldies" then end the festival.
The start is already on Friday the Stoppelackerparty with DJ Ralf.
Other program items on Saturday and Sunday include the vintage car and tug meeting, exhibitions by companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the Maislabyrinth, the Crafts Market and sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw bouncing castle, tractor driving (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
The organisers are the Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan nutrition requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Pured tofu with plant cream is, for example, a quark substitute.
The Vegetarian Federation also mentions the World Vegan Day on November 1.
On the occasion of World Vegan Day on November 1, the Vegetarian Association Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, and yoghurt is replaced by soy yoghurt.
Soya, oat, almond or rice milk could be used instead of milk.
Staggerable plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
For example, half a crushed, ripe banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple sauce or a tablespoon of ground linseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Loosen doughs instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of cooking strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But even 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silk tofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800 000 people in Germany currently eat vegan food, i.e. purely plant-based.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest High School met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we immediately left for Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city on foot, Manhattan.
Here was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The city does not sleep" the day was decided in Times Square.
Despite the shutdown, the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry on the second day and climbed on foot.
Then we went over the Wall Street financial centre to the 11th September Memorial.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city from the 373-meter-high observation deck of the Empire State Buildings, while enjoying the view.
Then we went through the hectic hustle and bustle of the New York streets over the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to linger in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have arrived in their host families and experience school life at Weymouth High School.
This year, too, a Hubertus Mass will be celebrated on the name day of St. Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße.
According to legend, St. Hubertus was a quite ruthless hunter, converted by a vision and later appointed bishop of Liège.
The Jagdhornbläsergruppe der Jagdreiter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth plays on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) for old, originally French melodies.
The winders wear riding clothes because they accompany mainly riders, horses and dog pack musically on towing hunts.
The festive fair will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to linger and return.
One that wants to make the name a program.
According to the encyclopedia, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of a visit to the homonymous café at the Opschlag in the county town of Kleve within sight of the University of Applied Sciences Rhein-Waal, it does not have to remain pure Déjà Vu feeling.
After all, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that as its goal: to make an actual stay not only mental, but also tangible again and again.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the inner life at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling right away.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner spoils the guest at the top with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually filled fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, made a name for themselves as restaurateurs before the opening of the attractive café at the Opschlag: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the Opschlag, the friendly café-lovers expect more audiences.
Not least through the university.
"We don't have a specific target group," emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two students want to address young students as well as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
The sympathetic owner couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew itself in various variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is the cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette - that's my thing," she reveals to the NRZ.
There were also two events in the bright café.
I'd better say one.
Because the harbour festival took place rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not profit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatzabend.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps that's why Daniel Büttner is not an outspoken fan of event evenings: "You can't do it all right."
And with an event, I always only address those who are interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible".
In other words, Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at Opschlag in Kleve.
The road that is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the Gastromeile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thank you at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival that the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club restaurant of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker everyone enjoyed the harmonious coexistence completely in the sign of the music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is also always the right celebration to make honors.
This time, Secretary Rolf Wagener was delighted about the special award "Singer of the Year".
"You not only wrote down a lot for us, but you also made a lot of rounds for us, for that our heartfelt thanks," said the chairperson of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
This year's awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals by means of activity bouquets went to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
==References====External links==
A special thank you was sent by the board to the team of club host Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had conjured up a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choir rehearsals every Tuesday at 7.45 pm in the club club.
"New singing voices are welcome at all times," says Schlotmann.
UN announces new targets for poverty reduction
As of now, the United Nations is starting to develop a series of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) announced twelve years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the drive for "sustainable development goals" to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals.
They have been included in the final draft document which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to 'think beyond national interests'.
"I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch a process to agree on universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
"These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium Development Goals."
Even if SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, the handball top league team still enjoys a good mood.
Coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that.
Everyone continues to be fully motivated.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't even know what such a victory tastes like anymore," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third division reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet torn out any trees, Malmon raises the index finger in advance.
I trained a lot of players myself in the A-Youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"It is also important to wait to see if there will be any reinforcements from the first," explains the SG coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous appearances.
Above all in the cover work and during the switching game, it did last but tremendously.
The exploitation of opportunities must definitely be improved as well.
So I hope that my players finally got their heads clear during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique, in order to voice calls for peace during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Fearing the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the Independence Square of the capital.
For two weeks there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later by South Africa's apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to fall back into a full-blown conflict, but recent events have troubled foreign investors and locals.
Much is at stake for the fast-growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring investments of more than 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA into the country in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, Renamo's spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to minimize concerns about instability.
On Wednesday, he told AFP, the French news agency, that Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who "will use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo gave up the 1992 peace agreement.
He explained to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who meet the heads," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and none is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reforms, has already stated that she will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but she has engaged in disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south link.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port that mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga replied cautiously to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
The instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many people have already been worried about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and easy-to-use roads again," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for life", says one author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal power has no chance against clever tricks," and the Arthur legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are "far too wild, too offensive, and sometimes too dirty to be taught in schools," which is why Crossley-Holland argued for a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I've been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that authors and teachers who were "excessively didactic" would "turn off" children completely, because in entertaining stories the messages were "subliminal".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: "One can pursue certain intentions, but one should keep them as far as possible in the background."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult writer who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to the happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminally represented, revealed by history and not explained.
That's the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved to his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his last years came to life in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the extremely entertaining scene play.
From the arrival to the award of the honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that received much applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged time jumps from the youth to the approaching retirement.
On 22 October 1913 Hansjakob comes home to his children's heaven, to his courtyard.
And then the scene began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his parade role as the great son of the city.
Stylecht drove with the two-spänner and "Schwarzwälder Füchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
Not only was he received with a lot of applause from the audience, but his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to get into the role of the sister and gave her tremendous life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual playing scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music and completed the performance.
For the award of the honorary citizenship, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honour, who, in representation of the then incumbent, Hättich, together with a part of the city council, visited him.
The three king singers, who led Hansjakob to the exclamation: "Oh, how beautiful, youth memories of my own trilogy come to life again."
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentag children with their loud "Aus, Aus".
At the time, Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the native earth, behind his grave chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene.
There was a lot of applause and many words of praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of the Neckar Giants Grows
The chances of the league remaining of the Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
If there is a wildcard procedure, there is now one less competitor for the Neckar giants.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project dispenses with an application for a possible back seat.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
Nevertheless, a first breathing was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the Wildcard process until it was clear that Düsseldorf would not receive a licence," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until 23 May, Aufsteiger Düsseldorf Baskets will be able to submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove its economic suitability for the Bundesliga.
Until now, however, the Rhine countries have been denied the licence twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the final instance.
Haigerloch: The Church of the Lord’s Supper comes to the fore
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the cultural and tourism office of the city dedicates the last of its public themed tours on Sunday, 27 October, to the Holy Communion Church.
After visiting the Atomkeller Museum, the Haigerloch period after 1850 is to be considered, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning final point is a visit to the Supper Church.
There, the leaders get the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also takes a look at Friedrich Schüz's painting of the Lord's Supper with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the andert half-hour tour is at 3 pm at the Atomkeller Museum.
Tickets are available at the Atomkellermuseum cash desk.
The Haigerloch City Tourist Office is available for questions and information.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. spy.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor General's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax agency on the basis of unspecified circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be settled intergovernmentally, they said.
Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually ruled out.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden threatens extradition there, it continued
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams fought for the winning title at the clubs' tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
The tennis department of Sportfreunde Rohrdorf had received a dream weather for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the schedule, each playing against each.
The game was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum duration of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites were Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the trophy to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic finished second.
Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team reached the bronze trot.
In late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful ending of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Black Forest open-air museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24th and 25th August, as part of the summer holiday programme, to a colourful children's and family festival with numerous activities and events.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," says the press release.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, the right thing for every age is there.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The museum workshop is also working.
When building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or spinning, the young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
The many old games, such as wheelbarrow racing or stilt running, also promise lots of fun.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a guided tour of the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 and 2 p.m. each.
On a terrain tour, the children have to guess which stories correspond to the truth or yet are lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the grounds.
In addition, all children can look forward to the clown Otsch on Sunday, who runs his scraper snack from 11 o'clock with the museum guests.
Meanwhile, Hermann Büttner has a cosy and fairytale atmosphere.
The storyteller takes the little guests at 11, 1 and 3 p.m. into the wonderful world of fairy tales.
In addition, the children's costume dance group from Gutach performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both days of the event, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., numerous craftsmen such as the broom binder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can look over their shoulders during their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum can expect a varied holiday programme.
In a small town in New Zealand, Burt Muro is considered to be a lovable cow because he intended to compete in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt, despite a heart defect, is not to be dissuaded from his dream.
With his savings, a couple of donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he transfers to Los Angeles by ship.

Shrill beeping disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the dump.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to the coal import Rhenus Midgard relies among other things on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the hard coal on the storage site in front of the dike.
Two huge blue dumpers and reloaders distribute or load the coal here as needed.
Every movement of the transshipment equipment sounds a shrill warning sound over the terrain.
"The signals serve safety and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, this can be heard widely when the wind is unfavorable - and so there were already some complaints from people from the city north.
He takes the lawsuits very seriously and has therefore contacted those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, the warning signals are now being kept quieter with technical measures.
He will continue to focus on open dialogue with the neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Niedersachsenbrücke, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5 meter deep sunbath in front of the terminal, Capesize-Bulkcarriers can also be handled here for a long time.
"This year, we want to break the 3 million tonne mark on the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the imported coal goes to power plants in the inland.
If the GDF-Suez power plant were to be connected to the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge and the second conveyor could create up to 10 million.
Bayern’s Basketball Player Optimistic Despite First Defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the enormous optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team in Europe in the past two years," Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic reported after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening with title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
During their only third appearance in the European royal class, the Munich sold very well for a long time, but were simply not sufficiently clarified during the decisive phases.
The guests first managed the feat of converting a 15-point residue 13 minutes before the end into a lead, before Piraeus gave the game another turn.
"We fought incredibly back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made reckless mistakes again," said Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of Munich, who had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian serial champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title holder Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the varietal artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd jokes directly in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay's innovation has been expanded, as it did at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of Caroline's stand-up institution, this year the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until at some point they were too familiar to perform in a club," Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year's event will feature performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy charity event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will perform.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians participating in the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional channels, such as shows on smaller TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known for a sitcom on cable television (the ironic and slippery fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racial-focused W. Barrau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival's biggest visitors is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, sometimes he walks through the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany.
"After years, an agreement has now been reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of the last years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear negotiator was satisfied with the negotiation process and optimistic that both sides would come to a solution in the end.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game kamderads with machete
Two children admitted the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 - and 12 - year - old boys had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El País" reported on Thursday.
Afterwards, they would have played football in front of their homes in a working-class district.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five - year - old half - sister of the younger one, who had taken her away, was to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl described the course of the crime before the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
Among other reasons, the elder mentioned a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric juvenile hospital.
Pimp must go to prison
Due to exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threat, insult and dangerous bodily injury, the District Court of Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorman after two missions in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a process agreement.
According to this, in five cases he has met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent against their will after a few weeks.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He kept the income of the women, who partly bought for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he undermined women's contacts to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who taught the women, he brought them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partially monitored to control their income.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died next to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert indicated great doubts about the psychological limitation and thus a limited capacity for guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court did not have to hear any more of the injured women.
According to a police officer, at least four other cases of exploitative trafficking were identified after a first report by telephone surveillance measures.
The interceptions were marked by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the victims confirmed their martyrdom.
Another Witness, in which one of the women had discovered bruises all over her body, has not made a statement to this day.
It is "a completely broken personality" who considers violence and exploitation in this profession to be normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He got out of these circles and wanted to live a normal life after being detained," he said.
Oil price continues to fall to USD 96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, after concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude oil for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in electronic commerce in Europe late in the morning on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has put a strain on prices in recent weeks.
The US Department of Energy stated on Wednesday that the US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was evidence of increased demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China's economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude oil, a reference value for international crude oil that is also used by US refineries, fell by 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
Court blocks decision on NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy
A federal appeal court in the United States blocked the order of a judge who had requested changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program ("stop-and-search") on Thursday, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals stated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be suspended until a city appeal was decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city was violating the constitution with the way in which the program for stopping and questioning people was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the corrective measures ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its directive and the relevant training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the requested suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be released from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for US judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality, partly based on a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge had judged police officers violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they targeted in an inappropriate way black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including policy, training and oversight reforms, and ordered a pilot program with body-worn cameras in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after police control.
An oral hearing on the city's appeal is planned after 14 March 2014.
Stop-and-frisk tactics have been criticized by a number of civil rights activists.
Controls of this kind have existed for decades in various forms, but the number of recorded controls during the term of office of the partyless mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belonged to minorities, filed a lawsuit that developed into a class action.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force as well as influence the way other police bureaux use the scheme.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not crime; nor would money be wasted and the broader problem of a police force, which is under pressure after thousands of jobs have been lost in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which was constitutional, but only reformed the way the NYPD implemented the controls.
The Happiness of Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels can reach
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the "Helping Hands" association.
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already show considerable successes.
The first chairman Henne reported in detail about the work of the association.
He was himself the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, a further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the missions were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the actions mentioned.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning, according to Henne, to work at the association in an advisory function.
In 2008, Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the sickbay in Socogim, a slum on the outskirts of the capital city, in a record time of just under a week.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be rationalized away in Nagold.
One learns a lot in Africa as a physician, says Henne, for example deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, one could not undertake as many trips as planned, but for this many medical doctors came to Germany to hospite here in various areas.
In addition, containers of material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March of this year.
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself supplied plenty of local colour by telling about Mercedes vehicles converted from Mauritania to a mobile goat stable and the experiences of the Stammheimer musicians, who traditionally support the association, during their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motives, he mentioned his work in the field of auditing as a young Member of Parliament.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
It should not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Secretary of the Interior Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails and tracked them, but Coulson also called them and left messages, as the court learned.
"According to the prosecutor's office, Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is no one standing in front of people's homes hoping to catch them in a fresh act, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis said.
He said NotW used three procedures to investigate stories investigatively: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the second one, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say: 'And if he knew about it.'
Rumors of a Clarke affair were first picked up by NotW's feature editor, when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
At the time of the research, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Pawlby's movements.
On June 18th, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, about which I would like to talk to Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had faced Blunkett for an affair with a married woman when he himself was dating the co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned Reich tax, French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends without results.
In the conflict over the rich tax, the government and the professional football in France have maneuvered into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received club and association representatives at the Paris Élysée-Palast on Thursday and listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to spare the football from the planned 75 percent levy on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are expected to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be carried out, the head association of the professional clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, informed.
The Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 play days scheduled between 29 November and 2 December are therefore cancelled.
Binging: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning process at an early stage," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to get an explanation of the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring forward ideas.
Häussler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council".
According to Häussler, the flood that unpreparedly hit Geching on 15 May 2009 was a major event that raised the question of protection measures for the future.
A river basin survey was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"Protecting as many built-up plots as possible is the goal," says Häussler.
The planning is based on the protection against a flood that is expected statistically every 100 years, according to the German Weather Service.
The climate change will be taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
This is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häussler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aClimate, approximately four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, whereby the municipality can expect state subsidies of around 70 percent.
However, Häussler pointed out that support would only exist if an overall approach was implemented.
For this purpose, the municipality is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure had to be completed.
At best, implementation could start in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented last week in the municipal council (we reported) provides for local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the Stammheimer Tal.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering firm Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interplay of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, one is held to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
There was displeasure among residents of the old town, who have to suffer again and again from an overload of the canal network, even in normal thunderstorms.
The problem is known to the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
However, Häussler pointed out that the guidelines for sewer systems were different from those for flood protection and that this should not be mixed.
The municipality was obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way that two to three years of rain events could be dealt with.
Dimensioning the sewers larger would devour millions.
Severely injured after collision
On early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately blocked the street completely, but could not say a lot about the accident.
However, there are various testimonies that should first be evaluated.
It is clear that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, and the woman was so heavily trapped that it took the fire brigade almost half an hour to get her out of the wreck.
The actual cause of the accident remained unexplained.
Both of them came to nearby hospitals.
The route was closed for about two hours.
It could be called the Dostoevsky of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Astonishing the kinship in the exterior: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky with his massive oeuvre is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, who is quite valid in his own country.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand and one.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, paired with paranoia, security delusion and the belief of being chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture of John's revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugged his brain.
He understood, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a computer theology and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
That's the Blade Runner problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minderity Report" dates back to 1956, and it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
Here the principle of "pre-crime" is developed, "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less the official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which resembles our terrifying, mutants look into the future - and the police are reaching out.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the agency.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "There are no serious criminals in our society, but we have a penitentiary camp full of pseudo-criminals."
They assume that something bad is happening and prevent the criminal idea from being put into action.
Dick's story looks like the blueprint for the anti-terrorism laws and the NSA's listening noise.
Anticipating the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no more separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system's freaking out.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Not only does error and sacrifice buy, but it builds on it.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth again and again.
Spokesmen to testify about Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. spy on Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
Before that, the Green MP Hans-Christian Ströbele had met Snowden in Moscow yesterday as the first German politician to talk to him about the affair.
NSA disclosures strengthen corporate paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep across the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and the Fight against Terrorism (BAT), the German intelligence service, he should photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to the German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, again insisted in September that the U.S. would not use foreign espionage "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profit."
But since Edward Snowden, the former whistleblower, began publishing his cornucopia of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director at their word.
Reports that the American National Security Agency has spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquired data from American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company's paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The barrel that ran over brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then management is certainly also a potential target.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now represented almost as much a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consultant company EY.
However, in the documents leaked by Snowden, there has been no evidence so far that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"That's not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you had wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the range and technical sophistication of the US espionage agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in China.
A major change in cloud computing is taking place because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the United States are subject to local jurisdiction and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, about ten percent of non-US members rejected plans to use an American provider following disclosures about US data mining activities with Prism.
Jim Snabe, deputy managing director of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers who didn't exist a year ago – where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew anyway, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
It's always been like that.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally due to the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate governance does not usually brag about the countermeasures that have been taken, as this gives rise to benefits for attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick on a trade fair or unguarded lying down of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the Audi Executive Board, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect mobile phones in front of a board meeting so that they cannot be used as a listening device.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niche.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorized access," the BAT warns in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, France, Russia and Israel were ranked second behind China in the US National Intelligence Estimate in February, using hacking to obtain economic data.
A board member of a German blue chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French interior secret service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The secret services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terror, spy on their allies."
Hechingen: Fair gives answer to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important voyage of discovery that man can undertake," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding party succeeds now gave a special trade fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Important providers were represented around a wedding.
One trend: the retro look has re-emerged.
This starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
In the front, the clothes, often ragged and embroidered, are closed, often with a veil, but in the back they go down their backs and often end up in a train.
As Stefanie Koch from the fashion house Kleidermüller emphasizes, however, the spirits divorce.
In men, the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but you can also choose cream-coloured or brown combinations.
The selection of the restaurant is important, it was explained.
Jewelryless adjoining rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the Remise.
Uwe Link has an offer for those who want to get up with the carriage.
"But carriages are also popular for bachelorette parties," he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and wedding pictures.
The "after wedding photo" is getting more and more fashionable - in other words, photo series at special locations, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to mention the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable celebration.
Dog friends successful
For the second time the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful on a rally-obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the starter class and secured fifth place, and with 15 months old Marley he made it to 12th place with 87 points.
Susi Höpp, with her Woody in class 1, faced the critical glances of the performance judge.
Parents of a Georgia teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The teenager's parents, whose body was found in a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school gym, are convinced that their son was murdered, the family lawyer explained on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in an upright mat standing behind the grandstand in the school gym.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's investigation officials came to the conclusion that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which the 17-year-old's family doubted.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he died the way the sheriff concluded.
"They believe that it is out of any logic to violate both the laws of physics and common sense," says Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is concealed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to study and came back in the body bag," he comments.
US Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important issues remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy suggested that Johnson had died of "position-related suffocation."
However, a second autopsy caused another cause of death, Moore said.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would commission the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's Department was not immediately ready to comment upon our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities release all surveillance videos that the investigators checked.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped that the video footage contained evidence of how he died.
CDC publish allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for the treatment of children's food allergies in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-based children with food allergies increases.
One out of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to the CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the auto-injection of the brand EpiPen is most commonly used – to counter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep epinephrine easier in stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something is pressing my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it," or "My tongue is tingling."
Parents of intersexual children can choose "gender indeterminate"
Germany is the first European nation to recognise a third sex for children born with ambiguous genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare sex for such children, but can state "undetermined" or "undefined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to relieve the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding neonatal sex assignment operations and to combat discrimination against intersexuals.
One intersexual person said years later, according to the BBC, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and scarred.
It is estimated that one out of 2,000 children is born each year neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to the intersexuals, a group that is diagnosed as "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (eggs or testicles) or abnormally developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson was possibly intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States advise that the best available information should be used for gender assignment if a provision is not possible, and do not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding – if at all – for an operation.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing".
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not," he said.
One could make a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his/her sexual identity at all are not very accurate.
No one knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersexual people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-based, but based on their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female, but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were found in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the level of discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in their working lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys who do not match the gender picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or 'third sex' on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "sexless" person after a court allowed the lifelong maintenance of an "unspecified" sex status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third assignment, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French representatives of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school books.
The US website Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law, stating: "If the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that it would be better if babies were assigned a sex at birth.
"Parental life is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your own child," she said to the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genders were called hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Just ten years ago, medicine viewed sex as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned, after it is now known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender assigned by them.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a 'psychiatric emergency'," said Drescher.
When such a child was born, it was not the psychiatrist who was called, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory on the treatment of children with undefined genitalia is based on Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender is malleable.
He coined the term "sex identity" and argued that social and environmental impulses – how parents educate a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped whether a person views himself as male or female.
However, in a 1966 case known as "John/Joan", his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed during a botched circumcision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of transformation, but it was not," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male sex and married a woman.
When he was 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sexual operations have come to the public, who are "not happy with the result".
For example, with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana author born with XY-male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not clear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he was to receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation has made him barren.
Today he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law can "encourage stamping and stigmatizing".
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and allocate a 'unspecified' to the child," she said.
We fear that this will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don't know how the law will work, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognized as a third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law deals with the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at this time.
When they are grown up, they can decide for themselves about their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "authorizes" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Katie developed female characteristics due to the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in children's psychiatry.
Although she is barren, she hopes to have a child through adoption or surrogacy.
"The law gives parents room, so they don't have to rush to make decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do different tests and clarify things, giving them time before writing "male" or "female".
In this way, everything is fine – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the happiness of your parents.
And you don't have to rush into an operation that can't be reversed.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that drives parents because they think they are not doing the right thing," she explained.
In the end, the child decides on the sex that suits him better – and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decision.
Unknown hurt girl by shot from car
Unknown persons have injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in the event of gunshots from a car.
The perpetrators had probably fired an air-pressure weapon on a group of children in Genthin on Thursday night.
That's what the police told us in Burg.
The girl was easily injured on the left calf.
Rescue personnel took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disk broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police were investigating, they said on Friday.
Until now, the Kempten Police Inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called twice to eject children who threw them against house facades.
Since the house owners recognized this in good time and removed the eggs immediately, no damage should have been caused.
Furthermore, some Sylvesterböller were probably ignited in the city area, but also here no damage was caused.
A resident of the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his wheel trims were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, however, the man found his wheel trims in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to continue to work.
Living with a Future Perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives fantastically.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbours and also not too much traffic.
In the city it is only a few minutes by public transport.
"You are hopefully not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing at a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new place for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern that in old age, the many steps to the house and in the apartment can no longer cope, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifties woman has had to learn on her own what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap.
Only recently a book by her appeared on the topic 'Happy living in old age - What form of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age,' she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the duplex apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment surrounded by greenery.
Today, at the age of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the subject of 'living in old age'.
Most people push it away as long as they can.
Only the others grow old,' she says, smiling.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you worry.
'But then it can be too late,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 residential models for self-determined living in old age.
'But what kind of housing you choose is always an individual decision,' she explains.
T he solution was not for age.
Even those who can afford retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also get sick.
And: 'Without a good knowledge of the national language, you can also join forces in the Dolce Vita,' the specialist book author says.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative housing forms or the often cited pensioner's association.
In old age everyone has his ticks and quirks
'For me such a roommate would be nothing,' she says with a wink.
Especially not as in a student group with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age, you simply need your retreat rooms,' Ries says.
Nevertheless, the author does not want to rule out the fact that a residential community of seniors can still work.
However, this would have to be different from the classic student group.
And sometimes you just want your peace,' she believes.
With this opinion it is not alone at least in the state capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as they can,' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, head of the Citizens' Service Life in the Age of the Capital.
Your office advises people on the topic of 'becoming older'.
Therefore, especially older people would often also accept inconveniences and restrictions, only in order to remain in their usual environment, this is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today there are many possibilities to make the house or the apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends that all those who are concerned with the age-appropriate conversion of their house or apartment first of all to inform themselves thoroughly and not to commission the first-best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental apartment one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clarifies.
But it is not always possible to transform the existing apartment according to age and thus barrier-free, even if it is so beautiful.
This experience had to be made by Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stairlift inside the apartment, the path paved with stairs up to the apartment door would be the far bigger obstacle.
She'll keep looking until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she is more afraid than before the spider at her apartment door.
USA wants Snowden to continue prosecution
The U.S. has not changed its stance on former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He continues to be accused of having passed on secret information unlawfully.
He therefore had to face criminal proceedings in the US, said Jennifer Psaki, US State Department spokesperson, in Washington.
Nor would Snowden's recent statements change that.
Previously, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to stop punishing him.
Psaki stressed that Ströbel's statements were those of a parliamentarian and not that of a German member of the government.
Secret Service revealer Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the USA in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Attorney General.
Following a translation distributed by Ströbele, the letter reads as follows:
To the persons in charge
I've been asked to write to you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I used to work as a technical expert with the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of my government’s laws, which led me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was exposed to a serious and persistent incitement that forced me to leave my family and home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of all-encompassing surveillance that no one is accountable for as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations resulted in many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the previously covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits for society from these insights are becoming increasingly clear, while the risks accepted have been visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat Dissens as a fidelity breach and strives to criminalise and prosecute political expression.
Nevertheless, telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this negative attitude.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, in an appropriate and lawful manner.
I look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to safeguard international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testifies by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality has sold the former kindergarten on Gartenstraße to a private person.
The sale was approved by the municipal council in its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," Maier emphasizes.
The budget was set at EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house, like heating, looking for the garden and clearing the sidewalk.
"This effort is now gone," Maier says happily.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann raises the baton at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The president Manuela Honeck presented the music pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully manage the first musician's jock.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisors have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book, and on Thursday night it reported that the president's top advisors had conducted "extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011" to find out if Obama's dwindling hope of re-election would look better if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Policy correspondent for the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of efforts by campaign leaders and the White House, including former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact on poll scores to exchange former Secretary of State Clinton for Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisors – including Daley, former campaign leader of Obama, Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisors, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change.
"Double Down" claims that Daley was at the head of the effort to exchange Biden despite their "close, personal relationship" before they finally decided against such a move after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy "would not significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
It must be remembered that the president had terrible poll values at the time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley described the investigations as "a duty of diligence," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that considerable effort had been made during the campaign to re-election to determine whether such a move would pay off with regard to the ballot boxes.
"Campaigns don't spend so much money on surveys and focus groups if you don't seriously think about something," Martin explained on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he did not believe that the president was "conscious of the possible change," the former chief of staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama's political investigation had reached his desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama had not known about the investigation into whether Biden should be dropped in the elections.
"Possible," Martin replied.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
In the design of the Internet service, has e-mail been technically implemented in a similar way to traditional mail?
When designing early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, in the case of the basic technical protocols, attention has not been paid to establishing a stable foundation for a sound exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an e-mail to "Benni", are the computers of the two connected directly?
The email program or the browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of their service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call his provider for the content.
Are conventional e-mails read along their way through the net?
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the go.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail, which is deleted immediately or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The probability of unauthorized persons reading an e-mail is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails against readout?
With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against readout.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to mask the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not possible to easily recognize who communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany?
According to a study by Convios Consulting from August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail had recently fallen, GMail was able to increase significantly from Google.
Mother buried in the forest and pension collected
When his aged mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care allowance.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the woods after police investigation in order to continue collecting pension and care allowance.
At first he had covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he had covered up the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as one speaker said on Friday.
According to this, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: at that time it was noticed that no more medication was needed for the mother in need of care.
Investigators were told by the pensioner that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because the officials thought this was strange, they continued to investigate.
It came to light that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, an autopsy revealed no evidence of a capital crime.
Want some ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice cream shining in the dark – with jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous treat.
The idea came to him after reading a research on jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to artificially produce the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue during consumption, which increases the pH in the protein and triggers the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and shines – so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early stage of production, so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH increases and the ice shines.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal for us to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it's delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This in itself is impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball league after six days of playing.
Right now, the team of Ingo Ehlers will be facing the Derby against TSV Daverden tomorrow, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season starts again for us.
"I hope that we finally have our heads clear," Ehlers says optimistically.
With the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his entire squad at his disposal.
Even Daverden, like us, relies on speed play.
Therefore, we must keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, it is important to increase the coverage, which has recently left anything but a safe impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that's not why we're the favorite, because everything can always happen in the derby.
However, Panitz now wants to relegate in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing.
Joost Windßuß, who is active with doubles in the A-Jugend-Bundesliga club HC Bremen, is celebrating his season debut.
If you're not hot in a game like this, stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I'm more of a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and I will not do so this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million, to be exact – are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of 6.9 billion US dollars on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween then again is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion US dollars spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exciting inanimate objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft punk spacemen will make it into Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed up our dogs last year and were not alone to my astonishment.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year on their pets' costumes, according to the NRF.
That is a lot of hot dogs.
As far as candy is concerned, we're not squeamish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, says The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of candy bars, lollipops, candy and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, who go through the neighborhoods with the phrase "sweet or sweet."
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let's not fool ourselves – eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is sugary candy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Confederation of Confectionery Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't solved yet.
There's nothing more to Halloween than houses where it's haunted.
They have great names such as 'Terror Behind the Walls' (which, by the way, is in a real prison), 'Howl-O-Scream' and 'The House of Shock'.
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that generate $500 million in revenue, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you pee in your pants and then put your friends on Facebook, where you can't get rid of them again, and then the guy you're standing on leaves you with a comment like "nice facial expression."
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we made from a small age.
Fortunately, the "baby in pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which slowly rots in the front yard, is probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilo pumpkin.
Housing fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces recover charred corpse
The fire brigade had to leave Helmbrechts late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire in the night to Friday.
Rescue forces are keeping a charred body out of the house.
Rescue personnel found a charred body in a three-family house during a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said.
On late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already hitting out of a window.
The operatives went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
The building was no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany’s largest national church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
The background is a possible shortage of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently approximately 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030 according to the current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine.
With Burfien, for the first time, the Landeskirche commissioned a pastor on a full spot to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after graduation.
Burfien attributes this to the process of de-churching: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and I can focus on where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to the people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well on it.
Certainly more is paid in the free economy, but theologians have a safe employer for it.
This is true of the young people of today, who are concerned not only with career but also with meaningful work.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, Emsland or Wendland, it could become difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a broad education.
You can even become Federal President with it.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point belt as well as a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from bowler-works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the strain and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – it's going to be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day at the Defender Challenge in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire department called to rescue a puppy who was trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous ledge in a quarry
Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had run off after a minor traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her plight
Firemen scolded at the rock face and saved the dog from the safe death
The fire department managed to get a puppy to safety, which was stuck on a 15 - meter - high ledge in a rock face.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel female Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, who owns the dog, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby back and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing bitch and published calls for help on social networks when she escaped to the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meter high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station hurried to the spot and drove off to rescue Ruby, who was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during her rescue – she was frozen.
But now she's fine.
She ate some dog pies afterwards.
That was quite an unusual assignment.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby was very lucky."
There was the possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for examination, but found nothing other than exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was scary."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her in her arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too big and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firemen did a great job.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each one of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid that she would fall down, but she stayed up."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never hit on Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard" as a background singer.
Perry explained that she had dinner with the old rocker and that "he hit on me when I was 18".
She added: "That was a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jagger, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denied that he had ever attempted rapprochement with Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Perhaps she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on this year's Rolling Stones tour.
Their new album "Prism" landed first place this week.
George Kerevan: European Unbundling Gives Scots the Choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This is the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire border along the Hadrian Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde presentation highlighted the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this did not play a role in the headlines, as expected.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules if it is more favourable to them.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continuing non-observance for Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
So not really a story.
And one that has come so long that it already resembles a fossil: the first time I heard the "Independence means passport controls" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance according to the European whistle?
Why exchange the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
Across the EU, parties that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party Alternative für Deutschland – founded only this year – won nearly five million votes in the Bundestag elections in September, effectively driving the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket in which the respective national economy is forced to adhere to the single currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pegged its members to exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave that.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin.
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the "green" energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world's wage fixings do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being cornered by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is coming up, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and to lift Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimation and has pushed on Europe's own economic policy, with which the troubled French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU Front National has just won a decisive by-election, placing the ruling socialists in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right-wing spectrum would automatically bring benefits to the left.
What is Le Pen doing with her newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something more like the 'Europe of the (sovereign) nations' which General de Gaulle favoured.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may stick to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of being flattered by the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be alone in Atlantic rain.
Where's Scotland with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (finally) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can put themselves where.
I suspect that Scotland could go quite well in a looser European network if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider equalising Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour finance minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition were responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to be forced into austerity by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Grow Up Faster
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white agemates, as studies show.
Physical changes do not immediately mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned when her daughter grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida this week, paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time calming parents down – normally this is no sign that puberty is coming up quickly," Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic hair, armpit hair, and body odor, are seen in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of the menarchs (appearance of the first period) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to reach the Menarche," said Kaplowitz, author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The essential guide to dealing with this frequently occurring problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually marks the beginning of puberty, but it is 'touching' if breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight years.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
If progress is faster, tests by an endicronologist may be indicated so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods to delay an early menstruation and to defend against another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their agemates."
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They are worried about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter got her days when she was ten.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are causative.
Boys come to puberty like girls used to.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, which establishes a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white agemates.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to the climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys have already grown facial and pubic hair earlier, the trend towards full-scale previous puberty is not as pronounced as with girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is widespread even in babies and toddlers.
"We need to be careful how to identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This can mean that you have to have a conversation sooner than expected," advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than expected.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, which sets the tone for a bitter clash on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width that passengers are offered on long flights in the tourist class – not always those that airlines are the most striving for, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims on the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
This week Airbus called for an industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US arch rival Boeing says that airlines should decide.
The confrontation comes at a time when the aircraft builders are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – in particular whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – is crucial for the stated economic results that the new "mini-jumbo" design is intended to deliver.
Boeing claims that its modernized 777X has 406 seats in the tourist class, which are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18-inch seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often distribute blows through technical details by means of advertising in the trade press.
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war, showing donors a picture in which three people sit squeezed together in a restaurant, with the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are tighter than regional turbo-props," says Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
People are getting fatter in the face of changing eating habits, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the average male American between 40 and 49 years increased by ten percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
According to US health statistics, the waist circumference of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says its rival adheres to a seating concept from the 1950s when the average body circumference of the newly baptized Jet Set was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been carried out to show that one additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contests Airbus' figures on seat dimensions and says that it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines will strike the balance between air fares and equipment.
The company also explains that according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
"It really means giving airlines flexibility to do what they think they need to do to be successful," explains Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is about more elbow-free, but for manufacturers, it is becoming increasingly an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars after list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the battle over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on comparing the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increase in unit costs is still lower than for machines currently in use with ten seats per series.
"Boeing therefore squeezes more seats into its aircraft in order to make it more competitive with our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row with existing 777s indicated that many passengers chose the tighter arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper air fares.
"Eightteen inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the 777 threat," says Mary Kirby, cabin equipment expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet sellers even carry band measures to measure the setup in the competition.
Even if they price the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with highly compressed design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not sold one, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of increasing the adaptability of the cabins and offering wide seats on the aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to thwart, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could help the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Further trials are needed before human tests, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying all the methods available on the market, but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker to experience no nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, had taken a "time-out", the researchers explained, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, if a future vaccine for humans is safe, it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
"They then know that when they start smoking again, they no longer feel pleasure in it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to quit the habit," he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies having been influenced by Obeid
The former minister of the Labor Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is being investigated by the state corruption authorities.
The former NSW minister denies having changed the rules on maritime leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned covert holdings in three properties on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) expanded its investigation into whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state to extend lease contracts at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without a call for tenders after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is being investigated for the accusation that Tripodi knew about Obeid's hidden interest in the land after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, testified accordingly on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer maturities.
In 2009, the lease agreements for the companies at Circular Quay, which raised 2.5 million dollars annually to the Obeids, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken in favour of public tenders.
However, he denied having made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had urged a restructuring of the government’s lease arrangements.
A telephone record submitted to ICAC showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Port Ministry after working under Obeid at the Fisheries Authority.
"Was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial lease arrangements?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Wheaty Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi answered.
I don't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighter planes attack Syria, official sources say.
Israeli fighters attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out air strikes on rocket shipments to Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to "realism test"
The government is considering a "realty test" for foreign workers with 457 visas as part of extended measures.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used via a criterion designed to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for family and friends moving to Australia.
A government proposal for a discussion was published today after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be viewed as an insult by Australia's neighbors.
"Declarations such as 'foreigners should stand in the back' and 'align Australians first' are a very unpleasant relapse in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market," she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region took an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal for a discussion outlines twelve measures that were once envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes, while others are still being considered.
If the 'accuracy criterion' is adopted, a person applying for a visa could be checked to see whether 'the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking'.
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after hundreds of companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers had finally hired.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island with a refugee boat this week.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been cared for since his father's death on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study was announced by the UK Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2 Ltd's work proposes to implement high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England as early as the start of phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project 'will bring Britain closer together'.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of travelling from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our destination for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to work "unmistakably" for Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to explore the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the report of the inquiry with the British ministers next year and deciding together on the next steps.
Rules on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen regulations for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read, watch or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "flight mode".
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books at take-off and landing.
However, Australian companies are not following the decision that US airlines have to do a lot of work to implement it, but are not pursuing any immediate plans to change their rules.
CASA also stated that the announcement would be looked at, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of flight in Australia still apply.
"CASA currently has no specific rules on the use of electronic equipment in aircraft," was announced.
The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions provided by cabin crew.
Virgin has already had talks with CASA about extending the use of his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and has declared that changes are open to change, but these must be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of CASA's approval of electronic devices, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas said that, until further notice, we will stick to the current rules.
"Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices should not be used during take-off and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that," the company said.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations from which passengers can benefit, and we will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has different effects for US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs, and customer instruction.
"After confirming the tolerance of their fleet, an airline can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases with poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended stowing heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats during take-off and landing.
Before the reierderby against Schalke, fellow BVB trailers with light rockets had provided for ugly scenes in the Veltins arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced hard consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - initially.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustic, which offered itself to the viewer until shortly before the whistle of the Bundesliga match between the German vice champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests were to be heard with their songs.
The southern grandstand, on the other hand, where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, presented itself at first exceptionally quietly: no chants, no battle cries.
The pedestal of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the common cheering, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the grandstand, a large flag with the inscription "Section Stadium Ban" blew alone.
Only as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player entered the place, branded short-term cheers.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and waving scarves - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the Southern Tribune nothing moved.
Also, the fact that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not cause a celebration mood.
It was only five minutes before the whistle that the Capo climbed his podium - and the tension, which had been almost tangible with hands until then, exploded in a loud scream when Dickel asked for the mood on the ranks in the stadium as usual.
The last one was the south grandstand as usual - and finally the loudest place in the stadium was here again as usual.
And at the latest when the loud invitation "Derbysieger steht auf" came with whistle from the South Tribune, everything was again as usual.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Directly before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04 some of the BVB supporters had fired light rockets into the audience and on the pitch - and almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was whistled late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the top of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," the BVB boss announced at a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening.
As an immediate measure, Watzke forbidden the Ultras a choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbade that," he explained.
We cannot abandon the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - by Tuesday they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
"This is going to be drastic," assured Watzke.
One should be curious how the reactions on the southern grandstand will turn out.
Pawnshops are booming in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pawnshop at the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay her daughters' school fees.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, and all my money is in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) each month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not sufficient, she explains.
Indeed, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where it has made its exchange, has become the third pawnshop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Pawning jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore require an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
Pawnshops, however, offer the advantage that no verification of creditworthiness or proof of income is required here, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to pawnshops after families feel the pressure from rising living costs as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to loose fiscal policies in developed economies, families with lower and middle income are looking for pawn shops to compensate for the difference in stuttering economies.
This week, the rating agency called Standard & Poor's growing fiscal debt, mainly through rising mortgages, a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
According to the Agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has just come out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that in view of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have reinforced the trend to pledge personal items, as people take the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the 200 pawnshops of the city state are gold.
People say to themselves, "The price of gold looks good, let's pledge grandmother's gold chain and get it back next month."
The largest Thai pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen 20 percent customer growth in its stores in recent months.
The growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company is financing this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders were caught in the crossfire due to high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawnshops not only offered cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly increase the debt.
"Customers borrow items they already own and the liquefaction of personal valuables does not increase household education," she explains.
The pawn lending business is increasingly accepted as short-term, hedged financing.
Also, not all people who use pawnshops are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the stores of ValueMax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
We have customers from every social class.
"These include wealthy people who borrow for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses who need to bridge cash flow bottlenecks," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service revealer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to clarify the increasingly explosive NSA spying affair.
According to Green MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-secret service employee would testify at a German prosecutor's office or before a committee of inquiry.
Snowden pointed to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the bailout package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian deputy Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency aid for electoral services.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and cataract treatments, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after inpatient stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas I received from hospital staff that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability by the Tasmanian government.
The state had to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report on a monthly basis on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would be of little use if "they were not accompanied by real reforms that will put the Tasmanian public health system on a more sustainable path."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he had first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state's public health system from the care list," said Wilkie.
According to the state government, these electoral achievements will largely offset recent cuts.
But the opposition spokesman for health policy at federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is only a "pattern solution".
"We are in today's situation because the Labor State Government has withdrawn 430 million dollars from the healthcare system," he told ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government rips almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth puts 300 million in it and then pretends to be the good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with extraordinary production equipment and contemporary details, but it is also heavier than necessary.
Playing in France in the 1760s, the story tells the touching story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slips into lust or sensationalism – and that's where its problem lies.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a tormenting penitent shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and jet gas ammunition, the global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group declared on Thursday, while severe clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic substances are suspected to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war three years ago.
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) was made one day before the date on
1 November, which the Hague-based organization set up in Damascus to destroy or make 'inoperable' all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, still has to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place on Thursday in the city of Safira, where experts say there is a chemical weapons production facility and storage facilities, as reported by the UK-based Syrian Human Rights Observatory.
The activist group, which is tracking the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria, stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said that there had been losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not give details.
The fighting underscores the danger posed by chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to free Syria from its poisonous arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is "now convinced that it has seen and witnessed the destruction of all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria."
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of inspections and had visited 21 of the 23 sites indicated by Damascus.
The inspectors said that it was not possible to visit two facilities because of safety concerns.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been "discontinued ... and the objects of the chemical weapons program that were there had been transferred to other facilities mentioned, which were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I take a hat against the bravery and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director General of the Monitoring Organization, in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against Assad's government and its security forces, which include many members of the Alawites, a secession of Shia Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he explained.
Anger over Judgment for Bali Bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombing in 2002 were angry at the verdict for the last of the instigators to be brought to justice, because they believed Umar Patek was to be legally shot.
Patek, who was on the run for nearly ten years as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in the construction of explosive devices for the bombing.
If he was suspended, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A guilty verdict was also made on a number of terrorist charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man, who is also called "Demulation Man" because of his reputation as a master bomb maker.
The decision has aroused painful memories with June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him in front of a firing squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where a suicide bomber just 20 seconds earlier exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma and died three times after the attack for a month while he was attached to a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty in front of everyone else.
To keep him alive – no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and hurting many hundreds isn't much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He escaped arrest for almost a decade, but was eventually picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of reestablishing the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't turn himself in," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict took place before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not have mobile phone calls)
Air passengers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies from take-off to landing, but not phone calls, according to the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
At a press conference, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained how quickly they would be implemented, depending on the airline.
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew and the regulations for stowing the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among these airlines.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Passengers currently have to switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not take them off until the plane has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the landing approach, passengers must turn them off again and must not take them off again before the plane has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment also on take-off, landing and on the runway, the FAA explained.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been converted to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regime is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it," said Glading.
To be honest, we are sorry to have to feel like watchers on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections to surf, exchange of e-mails, text messages or download of data under three kilometers remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave an American Airlines jet publicly because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops still have to be stowed away, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Cell phone calls during the flight are also prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices at take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Transportation Safety Board, a national traffic safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause disruption to navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmission masts," says Rosenker.
A industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased to loosen restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri argue that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly more difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies mention that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the shutdown of the device.
In 1966, the FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air passengers after reports of disruptions to navigation and communication equipment caused by passenger-guided FM radios, which were the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA so that they do not mind electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi to passengers for several years when the altitude is reached.
The pilots adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment under the new guidelines, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, emit minimal radiation when flipping.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
One of the advocates of easing restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-reader and made a test flight to investigate problems, but could not detect any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he felt that the interference with the equipment was genuine, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only isolated reports from pilots who spoke in favour of a malfunction of aircraft systems by the equipment, and most of them were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order the shutdown of the equipment by passengers in case of instrument landing under poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a sensible adaptation for travelers who today would be extensively equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognises that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Bird rescued by air rescue service from North Sea drilling island
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released into nature again.
The water ralle was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was fed by the Scottish animal protection organization SPCA in its rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: "This water-rall was probably a winterly migratory bird from Northern Europe, stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the rig.
He added: "He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help."
When she was released, the water-rall was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those who care for prosperity and work in the UK want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders, roughly representing the UK's size, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and are focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while countries in the EU are stagnating.
They hope that new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil will be favored by the government rather than the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
In their view, on certain issues regulated by law – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be restored to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, as companies claim that the cost of Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trading zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed with the traditionally most Europe-friendly.
Finally, and this probably says the most, our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course to change the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This insight, which is found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a "sensible change" that brings the volume of action back to Britain.
It is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum at 16 percent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to Britain from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is now moving towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means greater attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation for businesses.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom Board of Directors said.
"Today's event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said Alexei Miller, CEO of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to increase the diversity of Russia's export routes across Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where the bulk of Russian gas is stored for Europe, creates an increased risk for conventional routes, as is officially reported.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "forever" eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other downstream countries is scheduled to start at the end of the year on the planned route.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate location in Germany.
The economic framework data are correct and the funding opportunities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country compared to Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed this out on the 9th real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
According to Ulbrich, the view on the transaction volume shows how sought-after German commercial real estates are.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the same period in the previous year.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive rate of return," Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds was at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of sexual offences against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with sexual offences related to children before charges were brought against the child caretaker Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
However, in the opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that "in the organisation, there had never been an incident of sexual child abuse".
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with offences involving child pornography, and another in which a sports instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted of abuse of children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare told Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistant lawyers, that he had known about the first case, but had not known the second.
He admitted that the opening statement from YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that "there had been external reviews of YMCA which recognised YMCA as the front line in child safety".
On the contrary, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August of that year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that the management had failed to hire Lord "from me down" and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety guidelines.
Lord had been convicted at the beginning of the year of sexual offenses against twelve boys during his two-year employment for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord's violations of child safety.
The staff said they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, taking care of them privately as a babysitter, leaving them sitting on his lap, saying to one that he loved it, and letting children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord, who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child service director Jacqui Barnat, who was the chief lord at YMCA Caringbah, "was very intimidating and most of the time very unapproachable".
The managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, her friendship with Lord affected her judgment, which is why they did not report him.
Hare stated that he had informed the board of YMCA NSW that the lesson to be drawn from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not reporting" by employees and that the board had agreed to it.
Hare said the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations were made had been made by YMCA's child services manager Liam Whitley.
He said that this was intended to prevent contamination of the evidence, but this had been 'excessive' and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children during the period between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on sexual child abuse, of the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in recruiting, checking, training, training and supervising staff.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister, but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments have mostly been limited to foreign policy and his role as ambassador to the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East.
When asked if he would like to return to the office of Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the London Evening Standard as saying: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ..."
When the horse show experts arrived in droves in Cardiff to choose the Horse of the Year, they were aware that a fierce competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who isn't even in kindergarten and only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee trotted loosely through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both of the same size, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his performance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate cap on in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony that lay far above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then had practiced every day with the Shetland Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire field and left with gold trophy and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Totally strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was electrified and everyone cheered and applauded him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes care of.
The way he started, it won't be long before he's on the "Horse of the Year" show – and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee according to how well they had fought and presented themselves in the performance ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Führer – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes have contributed their part, which really fit perfectly to the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be "reformed" after call
A Chinese newspaper, which had demanded the release of a reporter charged with defamation on the front page, was to be reformed, a press regulator explained.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on TV that he had accepted bribes to fake reports about a sub-state company.
The New Express will now be subject to a "comprehensive rectification", the regulator said.
The "rectification order" was issued by the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Authority.
Preliminary investigations revealed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express, a member of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports about the listed company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly," the regulator announced in a statement.
She said they had decided to "punish Chen Yongzhou with an administrative penalty and withdraw his reporter license."
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to carry out a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant persons in charge of the New Express be identified and immediately reviewed the New Express management team."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he said to the state news station CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was looking for money and fame.
I realized I was doing the wrong thing.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express released an apology on the front page and stated that they had failed to check the reports correctly.
Several known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in the law at the beginning of the year, in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel with own railway between the USA and Mexico discovered
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operation, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the tunnel measuring 120 by 90 centimetres as one of the most sophisticated passages they would have ever found.
The zigzag tunnel, which runs over a length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported undetected in it, the authorities explained.
Eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were seized during the discovery of the tunnel, according to the court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatened with prison sentences of between ten years and life in the event of a sentence of guilt.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers are putting on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents drug cartels with the challenge of quickly bringing their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre-long passage with rails running from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are the parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has commented on the separation of his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, which was to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope."
Kerr and he still loved each other, the 36-year-old emphasized.
"We will support each other and love each other as Flynn's parents."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
Veganism, according to the encyclopedia, is subject to vegetarianism, but differs from it in a very significant way.
While vegetarians allow themselves the consumption of cream cake, ice cream or a strong edam, these gluttonies are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, besides the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan lets off all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, one may wonder, but on closer examination the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, owner of the local reform house, which has a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
The native New Zealander has been living vegan for 13 years, in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "In 1997, I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
At the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers synthetic leather to normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor expresses the maxim of vegans, which extends to the entire consumption behavior.
Instead of mourning burgers, scrambled eggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, being vegan does not represent renunciation, not asceticism, but it's an enrichment." Proctor's assumption that dietary conversion reduces the choice of food options is based more on the power of habit.
And it was precisely these conditionings that caused some of the attempts, however well-intentioned, to fail.
"The addiction factor is a crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And he says, "Certain tastes cannot be fixed to the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," the vegan explains.
Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and some vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste hearty.
Of course, you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It should taste, but that is not only to reduce animal food," says Proctor.
He did not suffer from health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me, the transition had a positive aspect.
I don't take foreign cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who only eat vegan food.
"My blood tests are fine, I often get checked," Proctor reveals.
In particular, many vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed with feed instead of grazing in the pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat you buy in the freezer," says Proctor.
For vegans, there is also the possibility of taking the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor did not have to go far enough for food procurement.
After all, basic foods are everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I'll find everything I need on the spot.
Only once in a while I buy something special.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this is what is known to be the case with "ordinary" finished products."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than generally assumed.
"There is a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small tricks you can achieve good results, if not better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor could also surprise his in-laws.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new seasoning.
This has a dynamic, if you cook together, it has a new value.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he has been met with scepticism.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - with such questions you have to act as a vegan with sensitivity.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to be an enclave.
And in more detail, the everyday world doesn't seem as vegan-foreign as it was supposed - and the vegan is not as restricted in everyday life as generally assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
French fries are everywhere!
"Many doner shops offer falafel, or a vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he avoids pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are getting ready for it so slowly.
"When I started to feed myself vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can identify a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If there is enough demand, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the galley in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor has the wish that other restaurants also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor states.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make the vast majority impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, purchasing vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially when one learns to understand that also in peanuts animal additives can contain as color giver, one seems to quickly leave the courage with the observance of ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are used as food and detergents.
"You gradually develop a scanner look and know which signs and logos you have to pay attention to."It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or stumble," Proctor says.
Veganism, it's an important moral finger pointing at the consciousness.
He may not quite manage to abandon his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to critically question his habits.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in their breath.
Trading at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger breakdowns at the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday the indices of the Nasdaq had not been calculated for an hour because of errors in data transport.
In August of this year there had been two breakdowns in a week alone.
At first, due to technical problems, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively faulty purchase orders to the option markets.
As a result, the stock market operators needed almost a whole day to review and cancel the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trading in the U.S. came to a standstill for several hours due to a computer breakdown at the Nasdaq stock exchange.
Last year, Facebook's IPO also caused a stir.
The Nasdaq systems had not been able to cope with the flood of purchase and sale orders, later identified the SEC and thundered the company to a record penalty of $10 million.
Konstanz: Radler moves 63-year-olds
According to the police, the accident had occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., was riding a ladies' bike on the left sidewalk from Bahnhofplatz towards Marktstätte.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped from a restaurant on the sidewalk, the police said that the bicycle driver could no longer brake in time.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the wall of the house, then went to the ground and drew a 15 cm long wound to the head.
An ambulance team took the injured person to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police send Assange an extradition order
The British police today handed over an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that the 40-year-old Australian had been given a "call to stand up" which required him to appear in a police station, and added that if he did not do so, he would be threatened with arrest.
Assange is threatened with extradition to Sweden for the charge of sexual offences after his options have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard had "asked a 40-year-old man to stand at a police station at a time we had chosen," said one spokesman.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged there with possible espionage charges after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks discovery website.
Driver who had raced between his legs with 210 km/h and hot drink will receive £1,000 penalty
A £1,000 penalty was imposed on a driver for driving at speeds of up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27th with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the beverage cup between his legs.
Howie pleaded guilty to the Colchester District Court without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay 90 pounds sterling and a sacrifice premium of 100 pounds sterling.
Tax on foreign property owners against London's speculative bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a 7 % stamp tax in the 2012 budget on dwellings costing over £2 million and annual fees for buyers holding homes as companies and not as individuals.
Revenues from stamp duty on residential property in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which amounted to £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceed the revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: "After the increases in stamp duty on high-priced dwellings and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention, it is difficult to claim that high-quality real estate is taxed too low, regardless of the effects of the outdated municipal tax system."
"But this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy real estate in London, or prevent owners from selling it," he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy south-west belt of London, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed an even annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market" on which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a Savills study.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the connection between a dog’s tail wiggling and his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs waved more to the right with their tails (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans it is well known that the left and right brains react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this with other species.
He also noticed that in dogs, just like in humans, the right brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail-wielding of their peers, the researchers monitored the animals while watching these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the quadrupeds and analyzed the behavior.
We will probably soon understand why the cock moves in one direction, in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs films with dogs – either a true-to-life version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog moving the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail tilt was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog, who is waving), her heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience, in which movements they should be worried about and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs, and if you are connected with the tail in one direction rather with friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behavior and visiting fellow at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Bristol, stated that this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it's a satisfied dog.
Another research project at the University of Victoria in Canada said: "Dogs tend to approach a robot dog when its 'tail' turns left and not right instead of getting restless – exactly the other way around than in the Italian study."
According to his statement, the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs in the various studies.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
However, since their behavior is easy to record, it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a gig in Glasgow after their lead singer fell ill with laryngitis.
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play at Hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert has to be moved.
The band's announcement came after having to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys stated: "Following the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys will also have to cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st."
"Alex Turner was diagnosed with larynx inflammation, which is why he is unfortunately unable to appear."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on 20 November, which has been moved to the Hydro in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconvenience caused by this.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be appointed new Cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who elect a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 is no longer able to take part in the election of the Pope – this is the case of a group of 120 "electoral cardinals".
In a statement in which the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting of all Cardinals would take place before the ceremony for the appointment of the new Cardinals, also known as the Consistory, was held.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elective cardinals would probably have dropped by February.
He said that a pope normally appoints as many cardinals as he needs, so that the number of elective cardinals would be 120 again, and as many cardinals as 80 as he wants.
The Consistory next year was important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero said.
At present there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they only have a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight Cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that it was "possible" for Francis to ask the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this position – this is all completely new.
Valero said that bishops from great places were typically called to be cardinals, but Francis was "full of surprises – so we don't know who he appoints".
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seatrest
General Motors calls back nearly 19,000 of its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seatrest, according to a statement from the US Vehicle Safety Authority on Friday.
In some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for reset of the front seatrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety for head restraints.
"When driving from the rear to the vehicle, it is possible that the headrest does not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury," the news was read on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1st and September 10th.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM explained on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
An Obama dialer's cry of despair
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs on the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a terribly sad book right now.
It is a book that I believed would cheer me up during the gloomy second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes Barack Obama's memoirs for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient records at night and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and took a breath away from a speech.
The election became a landslide victory and news spokesmen stopped to show the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates wept with joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
At that time, when Obama took office in 2008, he had 82% approvals.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening, as if you are being ripped out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I voted for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I, too, believe that the party-political blockade tactics have overturned too many efforts to push our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.
But after defending the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances, I have come to the end of my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign heads of state are allowed to interrogate or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans' private lives and why whistleblowers are punished that expose state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the public funding and spending limits were circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report which states that the White House's efforts to restrain the media are 'the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration'.
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that government work could have contradicted its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the Congress is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and coincidental events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unextriced alternative, he seemed unable to define his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hope we had heard of for so long.
But with Obama’s support falling to less than 45% this week, the book’s return to 2008 has become all the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved into air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to take a serious loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a meeting with the election workers after the decision, he told his employees that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his parental leave plans because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 tax, made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions off the table as to whether he was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that are important for deciding whether to cancel or reduce CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she is on leave," Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Palmer election commission officially declared the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat with 53 votes in advance after the re-counting.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system where you march in, enter the data into a computer, dial it immediately, and then get the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
It's incredible to vote with pencils these days.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously".
A public office is about public service.
"We do not seek any reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve this community at a critical time," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two of whom are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide administrative investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly picking up.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities to investigate the world's largest financial market, where US$5.3 billion change hands every day.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that is causing the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigation on this issue continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people related to the situation reported that RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to an earlier trader to the UK supervisory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is now said to have been on leave from his current position as European head of Forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly the leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct.
The Instant Message group of Usher included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma had stated that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb through instant messages and emails from several years looking for cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has upset traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units in investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low currency volatility limits speculators' chances.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks, "one can influence the market even with very low ticket prices".
The news came out the same day Credit Suisse announced that it had quit a trader at its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
"We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is contained," Credit Suisse said.
Painted the building fence on the Bechtle plot
A group of the citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle property on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, it cleaned and widened the footpath, according to a press release.
The planned covering of the decaying house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for safety reasons, because the terrain threatens to slip.
Alfred Abel, who is currently managing the property, had agreed on the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a banner with the message "We are for it" was installed.
However, this did not bother the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative much in their action.
Her motto on the big poster was "We are against ruins".
With this she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins in the Swiss meadow - should one day the giant project fail.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "building site", it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the city's project will be better for many, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign because the city is continuing to delay these answers, says the BI.
It was also heard that the mayor's public statements have an impact.
At the municipal council meeting on May 1, he had said that he was afraid that the spa would end if the population voted against the plans for a swimming and wellness complex in the Swiss meadow.
Some people therefore seem almost frightened, while others feel that they are a "pumpy blackmail attempt" on the population, the BI press release continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the colour and all the helpers.
Rangnick-Schelte for Schiris: Mane no swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the bulls was disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the Schwalbenkönige category," he took the two Offensivewirblers in protection at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The most recent reason for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at the 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, where the Senegalese became an alleged actor - which, of course, was not, as the TV pictures showed.
"A crass wrong decision," said Rangnick, who called referee Harkam "totally overwhelmed."
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved the same as Roger Schmidt in every single situation."
Schmidt himself does not want to have had contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I am the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old stressed.
However, in view of the success run, Rangnick made a praise anthem.
"There are only two words for this: Really good," he stated.
There's not much to complain about.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
Let's keep this going.
There will be hardly any changes in the squad during the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change things.
"Aside from a player, he wishes to leave the club," Rangnick made clear.
Supreme Court Confirms Obama’s Health Law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which obliges US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a fine by 2014 – is constitutional under the state's tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also held that the requirement of the Health Act that states should either extend the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise remove all state Medicaid subsidies was not unconstitutional restrictive.
The lawsuit against the law had been tried by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been strongly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 primary campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place lights up with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their gloomy valley.
Due to the low degree of sunshine, Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks into the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters height, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" said Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some valley dwellers used sun chairs, while others used sunglasses for safety reasons.
Until now, sun-hungry people had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
However, this basic idea has existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally adopted the 5 million kroner project (around 615 000 euros).
A similar construction has provided winter sunshine to the Italian alpine village of Viganella for several years.
Post barely emptys on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red dots for the Sunday emptying are still in different mailboxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find out that the emptying on Sundays and holidays does not take place any more," the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied.
Whether or not Sunday will be emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten will not be answered in the answer to the FDP's request.
The social and youth political spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to check here.
Sunday emptying is an important post service at Terminpost.
"Despite the increase in the price of letters on January 2013, this enterprise is radically and unreasonable for them".
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberal Group and city association, supports his group colleague: "What annoys me is the fact that the emptying times are being changed or even deleted here in secret."
The post office is miles away from the city centre.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays," says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also for the core city applies, especially not mobile fellow citizens would have to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying also within walking distance.
Tubenbeck asked in the city parliament if the city administration is planning talks with the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post office did not communicate with Lampertheim.
But to his knowledge there is also a Sunday emptying in Hofheim.
Your party has voted in favour of privatization.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurt Parking Fees to Increase Strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
This morning, the magistrate of the city is discussing a presentation by traffic officer Stefan Majer (Green).
According to this, parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, prices should not be increased, but the time interval of parking meters and ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council will have to decide.
The Retail Committee of the Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce considers this "not a good idea".
The parking option immediately before the store was "an advantage not to be underestimated for smaller retailers".
The Transport Club Germany is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick actions take you by surprise
With a narrow squad, the gentlemen I of TSV Freudenstadt had to compete in the Schiller Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen von der Schwäbischen Alb.
The Alblers stood with an experienced team on the other side of the net.
But it soon became clear that they, also due to age, could not quite keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstadter.
With the hard and placed blows, the benefactors were extremely hard.
Repeatedly, they missed the passports and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz had played over the middle of the net and were not there for block defense.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of Freudenstadters in all matters.
In the face of this overwhelming and game-determining performance, the third movement was won somewhat laxly and unrelentingly at the 3-0 finale (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd there will be a much more powerful opponent on the field with the TV Baiersbronn, who was able to assert himself clearly in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and point gifts, especially when taking the ball; precision was also sometimes lacking in the passports and in some critical game scenes the overzeal prevented the view for possible point wins.
In this very balanced meeting, however, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team consistently matched the great physical commitment and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
Care day at the little English hut
For the fifth day of care following the Natura 2000 project Oberer Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view into the valley was to be cut off in the area of the hut on that day, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
According to Kaiser, many hikers described this area as the highlight of the gorge path, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was a suitable instrument for strengthening the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time as tourism, environmental considerations could also be taken into account.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Conservation of the Freiburg Government Bureau, following the welcome by District Administrator Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the far-sightedness coincides with the aim of preserving the now strongly overgrown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to species conservation.
Tribukait said she didn't want to miss breaking a lance for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure does not only fit seamlessly into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the achievements for the future achieved with the Life project as well as the previous care days.
After these various remarks, district manager Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been cut in advance, and the forest tug would be ready to be picked up if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the clear view at the vantage point.
Löffingen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstädtchen Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future-oriented school, children, youth and senior citizens policy, as well as its own municipal works can be described as an attractive city, no second mayoral candidate has yet registered.
The 46-year-old bank clerk and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has been elected as the only candidate to succeed Norbert Brugger, who is no longer running for office for reasons of age.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, launched an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the company that was outbid by him at the Nortel insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that had purchased the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the Texas District Court.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concerned technology that reconciles search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which thus hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google submitted an initial bid for $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and last offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After being outbid by Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patent at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," the letter states.
Rockstar demands a high compensation from Google as it claims Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt sworn in first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the first freely elected president of the country and thus succeeded Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the court, dressed in black robes, who have his seat on the Nile and are modelled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Mursi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Morsi, an engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that, since its foundation 84 years ago, had been mostly targeted as a banned organization by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president, and in contrast to the presidial pomp of the Mubarak period, traffic was stopped only for a short time so that the auto convoy could cross the usually busy road connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "replacement wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to achieve the aims of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, to the judges in the wood paneled chamber in which he took his oath of office.
Later, Morsi went to Cairo University to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army band that played the national anthem he listened to in custody.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people in the university's largest lecture hall with voice choirs of "The army and the people are one hand".
Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the Military Council had taken over from the head of state who had been chased out of office.
But by taking the official oath before the court and not before Parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi's speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger discotheque ensures two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", tomorrow Saturday evening it continues with a Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers fell by ladder: seriously injured
On Thursday, when a defective external sensor was replaced, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell off a ladder and seriously injured himself.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the exterior façade of a guest house.
As he climbed the ladder leaning against the gutter, the ladder slipped away and the man fell onto the concrete floor.
He suffered severe injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Rapist in South Africa: Two Life-long Prisons
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by the broadcaster SABC.
The victim had later died from the consequences of the severe injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of crime.
The act had caused horror throughout the country.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought for the survival of the victim for 14 hours, but in vain.
The sight of the youth was so horrifying that the nurses and nurses needed psychological help.
Kana had admitted during the trial that she had been in a bar with Booysen on the night of the crime.
He also confessed to having beaten and raped her, but denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was insufficient.
During the trial, the prosecutor's office also stressed that Kana was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape in South Africa is almost a part of everyday life: every year there are about 64,000 sexual violence charges.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has a significantly greater population than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa, however, estimate the number of cases of sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times higher.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo looking for the "best ham in the world": The Pro7 star visited Bonndorf for the TV show "Galileo".
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham is the pork legs, Turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can ham, which you get in every supermarket, be a quality product?
Uli as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest explains Jumbo the working methods of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favourite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and coat does he come inside the factory.
Jumbo must also disinfect his hands before he is allowed to reach the microphone.
Jumbo sighted for strengthening at fast food in forest hat
"Here I am working huge quantities," the TV makers marvel at Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 clubs a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what quality matters.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the Ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH value.
"I can't wait to see if you can tell Roberto Blanco what's going to happen," Jumbo said cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But it's still worth watching.
The viewer sees that the dismantling of the clubs is still manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found on the shelf without bones.
The secret of the ham is the spice mix with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing remind Jumbo visually of a "submarine".
The trick: fir branches in the smoke provide the special taste of the Black Forest ham.
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disk disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test feed.
"It's really delicious," concludes the TV star.
This will enable everyone involved to live.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the full year and expects record income from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual pre-tax profit of between $325 million and $340 million, compared to $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are reached, then this means growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and recorded a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in private business in Australia and the UK.
"Our ten countries have been profitable since the beginning of the year, and some of them are well on their way towards record annual earnings before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest contributors to results.
In Australia, the leisure sector recovered in the second half of the year, compensating for a slightly weaker market for business travel.
It was similarly good for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while business customers also spent less on this.
The US business recovered from the weaker first half of the year due to the season, so profit for the third year in a row is expected for the full year.
The shares of Flight Centre rose yesterday by three cents to 38.20 dollars.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will have to cover at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The examination also includes 'unseen texts' to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, students will have to take an independent GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
Tomorrow, the Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Authority, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less course work.
In a speech this summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that "there is a broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would become "more demanding, ambitious and rigorous".
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say that the comprehensive math exam – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to spend more hours.
The curriculum pays more attention to 'real life problems', including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious tarts attract
The Kreisverbandsleistungsschau presents the most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and color strokes this weekend in the Bürgerhaus.
The evaluations were already carried out on Thursday
Once again, the local association W514 organizes this large exhibition.
Breeders of the clubs in the Soest district show here their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobby owners their rabbits.
On Thursday six judges performed the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
The visitors to the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will take place on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 am and on Sunday from 10 am to 3.30 pm, which is followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a raffle and to a deliciously stocked cafeteria.
Pamela Anderson separates from her legendary blonde curls and appears for the first time with a new bubi head.
Pamela's blonde curls have been famous since her role in the Baywatch television series.
Pamela Anderson is the newest star to shock his fans with a drastic new haircut.
The former Baywatch beauty has separated from its long blonde curls in favor of a platinum-blonde short haircut.
The 46-year-old actress presented her latest look on Wednesday in Los Angeles, and also made a snapshot of her Twitter page.
It's the first time in 20 years that the blonde sex symbol has short hair, and we love the moral change.
What do you think of Pammy's hair?

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum
At the next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, 21 October, in the New Museum of the Castle, the topic is "To Hell with Hell - Theological Reflections on Today's Dealings with the Last Things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parishes Salem, the Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about this in the past centuries and had put their trust in those images of heaven and hell "that still shape our ideas today", the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of perfection is rather characterized by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been properly driven out by the criticism of religion," says the speaker.
She has "provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have been lost to us".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death".
This is connected with the question of that longing, "which dreams that everything will be good in the end".
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 from Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The habilitation for fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a chair for systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleine Heuberg confirm their creed in confirmation
In two divine services 101 15- and 16-year-old young people of the pastoral unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been confirmed.
In the morning the group Laudato-Si accompanied the divine service, in the afternoon the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the sacrament of Firms, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, under the direction of Deacon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous parishioners, the Firmlinge had prepared themselves for the big festival day.
In different projects they got to know different tasks of the Christian community life and experienced together the Youth Day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race inspires participants
In wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to master the circuit over the hill chains around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel from the organising sports club Illmensee informs about this.
Among the participants were, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 altitude meters, numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good placements at the German Championships.
As expected, these two were able to leave the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time advantage to the finish line and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was again in second place.
With the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli from the Nightmare team who made it to the top of the podium.
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen came in second and third.
A pleasing development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years with the youngest to over 70 years with the oldest starters.
In the main race there were even more top athletes at the start this year.
Four drivers were able to set themselves apart from the top regional drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black-Tusk-Racing-Team.
Pangerl and a teammate have already been world champions in twelve-hour driving twice.
This year he became European Champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who has already named two German championship titles in the duathlon, is also present.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude, an eyelash final in the finish line was held in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to race over the finish line.
Only one second behind it, the experienced ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall classification.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann finished third in the overall classification.
In the women's classification Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 to vote him "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, Cameroon's capital city, in 1981.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then there was an inflammation that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, in the United States, a doctor has a ratio of 413 persons.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians would not be able to afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in the country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his fellow countrymen suffer made Bwelle mature the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people squeeze themselves in minibuses and drive with the tied medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help.
Things don't always go smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed like heroes: a feast, song and dance, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with his broad smile and unlimited energy – likes to attend the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team will start examining hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per journey," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document required for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The surgery usually takes place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the surgery the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the surgery and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and thus Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It's an exhausting amount, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free surgeries last year and knows that their work makes an enormous difference for the people she helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a hernia that he had received now enabled him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and volunteering for Bwelle's group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be in surgery where we can help drain blood or consider the instruments to be Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley explains.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated medical supplies.
Once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and instructions.
"He is undoubtedly a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no limits.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life, fulfilling a promise he made to his Father, brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy to do this job," says Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellent the fight mastered
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The old man and the sea", is cut on the body of Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old hare in his profession, acting.
No one can fool the old man Santiago about fishing.
So the two simply complement each other great.
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of whom the fishing boy Manolo speaks.
If Santiago is sitting on the chair tired of life, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and willpower.
Janson is on stage as a single actor for a long time.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he exposes the active scene in each case: Santiago's hut, the bar of singer Marie-Luise's favor, which sings about Cuba's way of life with her songs and her magnificent voice.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are guests of the bar at the same time.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
At a length of about 120 metres, a sewage canal from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne.
If you visit Cologne, you will not pass the cathedral.
The two towers rise into the sky about 157 metres and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors, who marvel at the two filigree church towers, suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne's underworld.
The meeting point for its guided tours is the service center of Cologne tourism directly at the cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacular: "We start in the underground car park," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore, of the remains of the old city walls, only that which was not too large remained.
Most users of the car park therefore rush past the Roman remains and leave only their car.
But if you take a closer look, you will find an archaeological site separated by metal bars in the parking deck D2.
About five meters high ruins of hand plate-sized stones can be seen.
"They are remnants of the Roman city walls, which were built in the second half of the first century AD," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to the daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper park level take a look into a dark, 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which is unfortunately hardly noticed.
Next station of the tour is the Praetorium, and here the participants descend again into the depth.
Here we see the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Praetor of the CCAA.
A visitor wants to know what CCAA means.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means "city of Roman law and city of the Agrippinens, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult".
And the Praetorium is the former governor's palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the anteroom of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewer, which is preserved here at about 120 meters in length.
"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you like," Schulze cheers up the guests.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After he has fetched the key at the cash register, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, walk-in shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground in order to get to the groundwater, which was indispensable for ritual washing.
To this day, at the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read through changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe becomes part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, for which construction work is to begin shortly.
However, a few years will pass before completion.
Leg almost chopped off: Reissue of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is re-rolled after more than four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily injury and damage to property against two 30-year-olds has begun before the District Court of Frankfurt (Oder).
He is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants were silent at the beginning.
They were said to have been active in the rocker scene and were one of the bandidos at the time.
The prosecution accuses them of stabbing and beating three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt in June 2009.
All victims were severely injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group Hells Angels.
One was said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Apparently, a chase with several cars had preceded.
According to the charges, it was about territorial struggles and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants had been acquitted in an initial trial at the beginning of 2012.
At the time, a court spokesman said that it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof lifted the verdict after the prosecutor's office had been revised and referred it back to the district court for a further hearing.
One of the defendants is currently in open custody for another offence.
At the beginning it was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the Tatnacht.
As a witness, the then investigating commissioner was summoned.
The focus was on cell phone calls from the defendants and other persons who had been interrogated by the police.
Difficult is that Rocker almost always adheres to a law of brass for them - and does not testify.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor's Office (Oder) said on demand that new traces had emerged since the last trial.
Eleven more days of negotiations are scheduled for the process.
The throwaway society doesn't think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point we were going home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the passenger and back seat the hunger is noticeable.
Of course, one or the other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What's closer than chilling to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a little something?
I admit I like to be there when it comes to fast food picking late at night or early in the morning.
A few fries, a Coke, a Burger - and then nothing like going home and to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco guys are noticeable.
Because what do you have to miss that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially on weekends, discarded paper bags lie on the edges of the streets and on parking spaces.
"Why?"I wonder.
Are people too stupid to take the bags home or to the next trash can?
It's not just that the paper stuff spoils the landscape.
Bags have already covered up traffic facilities such as guard rails and thus caused accidents.
But she doesn't think about that kind of thing, she probably doesn't even know what that word actually means.
When you travel more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after celebrated nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage pile up there.
There would be a few bags more or less also nothing - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to trample on the food leftovers of others.
I already see the day coming when the cities and communities are getting too stupid to clear the way - and the fast food chains have to demand pledge for their bags.
Obama’s Health Decline
After fierce criticism, President Obama yesterday made a backsliding on his frequently repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received a letter of resignation from their insurer, the Republicans in recent days accused the president of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday Obama relativized his original promise.
"They can retain the vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance," he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the terminations, Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to look for a new insurance policy in the free market.
Most citizens could thus get better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
The government said it was not surprising that the five percent of the population who took out insurance themselves would have to look for a different tariff, as their contract did not comply with the new standards of the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say very directly to these Americans that they deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the House's Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online platform had been "bad" since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement by an angry Sebelius to a counselor sitting behind her at yesterday's House hearing was taken up after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri, with a view to whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly challenged the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced a state-sponsored insurance policy to conclude a tariff with HealthCare.gov, which she now wanted to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air base
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed on Thursday to the American news channel CNN that Israeli fighters had attacked an air base in the Syrian Latakia the day before.
According to CNN, the target was "missiles and related equipment" which the Israeli government feared were intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot at on the night of Wednesday to Thursday, and the Israelis had been held responsible for this.
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the Latakia base showing Russian S-125 Newa defence missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles, which, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometres and can carry warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters quotes an Israeli government official, who is also anonymous, saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
In any case, a spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defense said: "We do not comment on these reports".
In the daily Yedioth Ahronoth, journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed that the Syrian regime had already tried to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah, partly successfully.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a "red line" followed by a military response.
John Kerry states in an unprecedented admission that US espionage has "went unreasonably too far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, hinted at a softening of the US's defensive stance regarding its surveillance programs, saying that in certain cases espionage had "inappropriately gone too far".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama, was responsible for switching to "autopilot" when the explosive revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's espionage activities became public.
The leaked information has led the US government to a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
Speaking on video at the open government conference in London, Kerry said: "There is no question that the President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned of some of the things that have run out by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so has insisted on what goes back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, 11 September."
He was the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that the U.S. espionage had crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: 'In some cases this has gone inappropriately too far.'
The President is determined to provide clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one needs to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons will not be affected in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved by its monitoring operations.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is eager to kill people, blow up and attack governments.
So what if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have heard of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US on anti-terrorism efforts, as stated by the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he had spoken this week to representatives of the European Parliament and other people and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations due to frustration over the National Security Agency's surveillance.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the US that Europeans remain on board in view of our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who is a Democrat in the Senate for the first time and is the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger about the NSA programmes.
Media reports, according to which the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe, have burdened relations with some US allies, although the head of intelligence said this week that the reports were incorrect and were based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents passed by Snowden, according to which the NSA monitored Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the espionage of allies as necessary and declared that this was common on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said that his agency was preparing the Congress trip to take place this year, hoping that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary was still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words".
He said that European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they have been using for years.
"Although we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones spying," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the resentment about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the ankle threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away match of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz begs for an assignment by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he's only been able to do it individually.
"We will decide on his assignment at short notice," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goal scorer with six goals.
Because the Mainzers must already renounce the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian woman lodges appeal against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, appealed against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15th, after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10th, while two other men detained her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to making up the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on the spot.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Ruby League, who turned to the Canberra State Department for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely worried" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are of course very worried, but we hope that she will be back home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed the verdict and is on bail of 50,000 baht at large.
In Australian reports it was reported that in the meantime she is on holiday in the resort of Krabi in South Thailand.
The court said Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that, following the recent assassination of travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may be trying to improve its troubled tourist image and therefore acquitted.
