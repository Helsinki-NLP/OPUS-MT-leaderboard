Fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered particularly dangerous, was extinguished. The prefecture of Normandy informed this on Friday. The fire had broken out in the night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with about 200 fire trucks.
The fire could be stopped
Closer neighbours were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. At the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people work at the plant. The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 the gas methanethiol escaped through a leak and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the wastewater system of the city following an operating accident.
Woman quits her job to search 57 days for her missing bitch
For two months a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and announced her job for it. The seven-year-old Border Collie had escaped from the hotel room during a short holiday in Montana. 57 days lacked any trace of the bitch - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they went for dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had panicked dog
In the hope that Katie could still stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception desk. "The employee says, "She left about four or four and a half hours ago," Carole King remembers opposite "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic front door opened, Katie ran out immediately. Probably a loud thunder had caused the dog to panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But days turned out to be weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake" who quit her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man called and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared again. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch was standing under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King recalled, according to "Daily Inter Lake." "The tears flowed. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found her."
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday September 27th, 2019
Six machine guns of type MG3 have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns. The fate of the Bundeswehr is unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "fearing" extent.
In the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition are disappearing again and again - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This can be seen from a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, which is reported by the German editorial network.
According to the paper from the office of defence secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one gun part and 3474 shot ammunition have been reappeared. The still missing weapons and weapons parts are among others six machine guns of type MG3, eleven rifles of type G3, four rifles of type G36, six signal guns as well as two pistols of type P8. In addition, 30 gun tubes for machine guns of type MG3 are missing.
The extent of the loss of weapons and ammunition in the Bundeswehr was "fearing", said left-wing member Martina Renner. This was all the more true since hardly anything was found in the course of investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a "poor balance". Renner criticised that the list did not show whether the missing ammunition was also the one that was found in connection with the investigation against the suspected Bundeswehr officer Franco A. "Although a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted of the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after being established by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitive showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was designated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but at first it remained in Iranian waters. From the shipping company it was said that one wanted to wait for an official notification from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was brought up on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards on the Hormuz Sea Route on charges of violating security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran was reacting to the controversial temporary setting of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the British Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil export is shipped through the straits. The tensions in the region had increased immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping was drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There were several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel pays tribute to the courage of the people in the Peaceful Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel praised the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets during the Peaceful Revolution 30 years ago. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU faction on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor recalled, among other things, the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "State security was taken away from terror," she said.
Musk strives for delivery record
Tesla’s quarter may hold a record. Despite the delivery boom, the electric car company’s last losses.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost with the prospect of new record figures on the stock market. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so Tesla could register 110000 orders, according to Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customers. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares were out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased so strongly in almost four months. Tesla delivered a good 95000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its current best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. Six-digit figures have to be produced for this in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but profit margins are low here. Despite the boom, there have been last losses.
Puzzle solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebral brain prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found out this with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress had also been made on the question of why children are so fiercely resisting tickling, only to demand more.
Finally, it was also shown why only the approaching of a tickling hand triggers laughter even before the touch. This is due to a deep layer in the cerebrum, which triggers the laughter already in the expectation of tickling.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with "Laughter" in the ultrasound area when tickled by humans. This "Laughter" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughing Is Suppressed While Self-touching
Up to now, it had been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-touching and contact by others - hence that people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers found out in the experiments on the rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during a self-contact. This is also the case when living beings clean themselves. However, during the foreign contact and tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh had been intensified.
But if the self-touching and the touch by others at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the rat’s brain cannot distinguish between the self-touching and the touch by others. The new findings suggest that people cannot tickle themselves because the self-touching activates a brake in the cerebral brain.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. Thus, they sometimes broke off this initiation prematurely in the experiment, showed flight behavior or fear rigidity. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: large fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered particularly dangerous, was extinguished. The prefecture of Normandy informed the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire had erupted the night of Thursday.
According to the authorities, no substances harmful to health are reported to have leaked. The samples taken do not give cause for concern, as prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was in use with around 200 fire trucks.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister’s sister commented on Boris Johnson’s speech at the first session of the parliament after lifting the mandatory recess on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country out of the EU without an agreement on 31 October if Brussels does not accept his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, it is unclear how he intends to achieve this.
About Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and to unite this country would be to withdraw from the EU." Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist in 2016 during the referendum campaign.
Memorial to attacks of Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honor of the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose replicas. They recall the roses that had been deposited by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the Cathedral in Oslo.
At the same place the project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. The opening will be attended by Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
Right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first set off a car bomb in the government district of Oslo on 22 July 2011 and then shot down dozens of participants in a summer camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party on the island of Utöya. 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran was able to set sail again. It could be a piece of puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been detained in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, said shipping manager Erik Hånell. Around noon the ship left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he said to the Swedish TV station SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London called setting the ship illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a news release on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker on 19 July on charges of disregarding regulations of the Law of the Sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well according to the circumstances, said Hånell. They had behaved professionally in view of the difficult and exhausting situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to bring them back together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar following the establishment of the "Stena Impero". At the beginning of July, a super tanker with oil from Iran, which is said to have been destined for Syria, was put on the chain there. According to the authorities, the supply was broken against EU sanctions against the warland Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the US.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Conjectures that it was a trade to free the "Stena Impero" rejected London vehemently.
The Strait of Hormus is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world’s oil exports are shipped through the straits. Tensions in the region have increased immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. Several incidents with tankers and drones have occurred.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between both countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the US had unilaterally withdrawn from the international nuclear agreement, which was intended to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time to end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put pressure on the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a stricter and extended agreement to other areas. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Due to the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protective powers, wants to ensure the security of navigation in the Persian Gulf with the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf.
With its protectionist economic policy, India is building a better future.
In view of the punitive tariffs imposed by America’s President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People’s Republic are being forced to redistribute. Financial chiefs of Asian companies considering moving their production from China to another country, say India in a survey by UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. This, of course, has to do not only with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a domestic market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have created a more significant role in the globally diversified production chain.
But now India itself has come into Trump's focus. Derogating from the Haudegen in the White House as "Kingdom of Customs", America has withdrawn the trading benefits for 2000 products from the emerging country at the beginning of June. The USA prohibits India with prohibitively high tariffs and demands a better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of the trade wars, the frictions with India are, of course, only a side street. In addition, America is also looking at the world’s largest democracy through the security glasses. Delhi and Washington link the concern about China’s claims for power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salve of American punitive tariffs against India is unlikely. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just taken up a second five-year term, is therefore likely to weigh into safety.
The problem, however, lies in a different place: the empirically confirmed thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult position in the socialist Republic of India. Also under Modi. His zeal for reform is mainly aimed at bureaucratic insanity, which for too long suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state. Companies are now getting faster building permits for buildings. They benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more effective insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions to liquidate companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has turned for the better in India in the first five Modi years. However, this does not apply in trade policy. Inspired by this, the national conservative government even created new barriers to protect internationally less competitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the West, Modi is attached to the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At the core, however, the "India First" advocate never moved away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the isolation of their industries are among the main voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this short-sighted policy.
funeral of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac is reported to be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday in the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, reports the news agency AFP citing the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the narrow family circle. A public funeral in Paris’ Invalidesdom was scheduled for Sunday, as reported by the media.
The competitor is carried to the finish line: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
The world’s top was already in the finish line when heartwarming scenes took place in the cooled-down Khalifa International Stadium. Jonathan Busby, from Aruba, began to waver dangerously in the first 5000-meter lead. He barely managed to keep his feet on a good 300 meters before the finish line, ran in an unhealthy, bent position when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly undercut him and dragged the last half-round of the stadium to the finish line. However, the forces were still sufficient for both of them to stop the clock that was running along after the finish line. As if the scene had not been strange enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unexpectedly drew the attention of the assembled journalists. He was shy at first, did not want to talk about his feat at all. After all, he wanted to set his personal best time and when he realized that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Cup by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances, he should not even have started. "That's why I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
That evening he did so with great emphasis - and much more intense than he would have thought. Because this feat will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even left his competitor Busby in the finish line and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, just over five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end, it had nothing to do with it, because Busby, who only came to the finish line with a lot of help, was disqualified at the very end of the World League of Light Athletics.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, started to set a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this was possible with 18:10.87 minutes, he was nevertheless disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was under 18 minutes already once". However, only in training, as best times do not count.
Million Meshed: Egyptians Prepare for Wild Protest Day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. An increased police presence was observed in the centre of Cairo on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around central Tahrir Square were closed.
Already in recent days, the police had stepped up their road controls and partially searched pedestrian mobile phones on news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who accused the critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had not been such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. Egyptian builder and actor Mohammed Ali, who was living in exile in Spain, who started the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for a "millions march" in central places in the country for today's Friday. Ali calls for a "people's revolution".
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to increase according to two groups of observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures could not be confirmed independently at first. The government also did not confirm and comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people had been "arbitrarily arrested", "just because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time," HRW reported, citing lawyers arrested. According to their lawyers, the accusations against those arrested range from "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association." In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces questioned and searched in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW data, also arbitrarily passers-by.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country. According to this, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: mail order retailers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online traders such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be exempt from VAT on donations in kind, the ministry explained on a question of the Greens parliamentary group, about which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday. However, the dealers could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens send back one in six parcels on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - subsequently ended up in garbage. Donating them would cost the companies additional money according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities evaluate donations in kind as a turnover, which is then subject to VAT.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies cannot evaluate products that are not for sale and can donate them free of charge to non-profit organisations. Companies should be able to rely on them not to be punished for donations. This applies not only to online trade, but also to other businesses from the fashion shop to the DIY market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is to be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underscores "the decline of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude of animals and tribes." From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the southwest of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had exhibited the painting again - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Time", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The picture could change ownership for a million dollars.
Most recently, at the first meeting of the House of Commons on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had had a hard exchange of views with the opposition following the lifting of Johnson’s forced pause. Johnson wants to implement the Brexit, which had already been postponed twice on 31 October, if necessary without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England, he painted a picture depicting a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. Thousands of truck drivers and other visitors see the work every day when they enter the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The fierce verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his senior advisor. Compared to the election campaign before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation. "We enjoy it. We will (from the EU) quit and we will win."
In recent days, Johnson had severely attacked Brexit opponents in parliament and accused them of, among other things, "treasoning" to the people. He dismissed accusations that he could put MEPs in danger because they could become targets of death threats, for example, as a "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to get some rest was if MEPs finally respected the British decision to leave the EU. It was not surprising that people were upset that Britain had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged atmosphere, the Bishops of the Anglican Church even called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect," said a statement. "And we should listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan Calls for Uno Intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister, Imran Khan, once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said at the UN General Debate in New York on Friday. "If this goes badly, hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this."
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each control a part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had deprived the Indian Kashmir region of autonomy status and thus suddenly increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government reacts with a hard hand against the current protests in Egypt. It shoots the population with sharp ammunition, over 2000 arrested in the prisons join the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protesting has never been safe in Egypt. However, since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything to avoid a scenario such as at the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drove millions into the streets. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi is not getting under control, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is at ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who you are financing: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the biggest economic actor. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. This was already the case before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER boss: no more "showstoppers" for capital airport
For two months, it was examined whether the complex system mesh works in conjunction with BER fire protection. The operators are satisfied with the process. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
Following large-scale Tüv inspections in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed examination, but also said that there were still shortcomings to work out in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we don't have a real showstopper". He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contained buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve is not likely to be too large anymore. The construction completion notice is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables are still to be corrected; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, intensive work needs to be continued on the processing of the deficiencies," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all dowels on which the cable lanes are attached. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection is not yet working satisfactorily at the junction to the station under the terminal. The problems had already led the project three years ago into another crisis. This time it is about smoke aprons, which shut down in a fire like a screen, so that the smoke does not spread. They go too far down. Therefore, 36 engines must be replaced. Then there should be new attempts with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally it was scheduled to go into operation in 2011. The costs have increased since construction began in 2006 from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Because the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the managers are planning to expand the airport. That is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board will take place on 18 October, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Finance director Heike Fölster will join Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put the airport finances on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Automats for Drug Exploded - Police Arrests Man
He needed money for drugs - and blew up a number of machines in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region had risen sharply. Millions of damage was caused!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police seized a 33-year-old German on Bürgerstraße and Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation for the establishment of explosive explosions in a unit of action with particularly heavy case of theft, which were led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "He apparently financed his narcotics dependence with the loot."The bomber had blown up parking ticket machines on Bürgerstraße four times alone between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60 000 euros!
The vending machine bomber is now in custody, and the police investigation against him is continuing.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further automatic circuits in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is revising its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price battle with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA takes over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed a press spokesman of Austrian Airlines to the APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported on this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa airline Eurowings will thus be de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four will remain in Vienna. From January 2020, the AUA will take over in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the speaker explained. The flight times will be coordinated with connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub and to expand decentralised traffic from the federal states.
According to AviationNetOnline, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "production company" for the group sister AUA. Among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be served with AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings equipment. Although the on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants are from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights taking off under AUA flight number are no longer handled in Terminal 1, but in the same way as the AUA in Terminal 3.
A price fight broke out at Vienna Airport after the Niki crash. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced only on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna will be increased to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost airliner will send four Ryanair aircraft including crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which criticized the union as a circumvention construct to the collective agreement.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's statement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years' time said on Friday AUA board member Andreas Otto: "We will remain number one at the site in five, six or ten years."
Queen-granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the cousins were the best friends. Now marries the last of the four. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: During the Italian holidays at the beginning of the month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have called for the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31).
"We are extremely pleased to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can't wait to be married," the couple, who have been together since October 2018 according to British media reports, said in the official release.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the coming years full of love and happiness".
Sister Eugenie snapped the pictures
The official engagement photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and published on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information about the date, place and everything else will be announced in the coming months.
But it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British succession and the real estate mogul will be a similar celebration as the marriage of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers a heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to look closely at the genetic material of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the genetic material of 9000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Hochgebirgsklinik Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diets are among the main influencing risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is insufficiently known, according to the researchers. Now, the scientists want to compare the complete genome of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at UKE.
Currently, more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known for possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - according to the hospital. Every year, about 200 are added.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart weakness and heart attacks. According to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center, the data could also be useful in the study of other common diseases. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there was a strong will to use the data to investigate other diseases. The Foundation’s clinic in Davos has so far been dealing with allergies in particular. Now, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be established on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics should be created. To justify his commitment, the logistics company based in Switzerland said that he had been operated on an open heart in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the Hamburg City Health Study. According to the hospital, this is the largest local health study in the world with 45,000 subjects. The scientists assured that genetic decoding is strictly concerned with the protection of the anonymised data. It is a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, the genetic material of a human being can now be decoded within 24 hours. The pure material costs would amount to 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is expected to start on October 1, and all 9000 samples are expected to be analyzed by the end of 2020.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were underage, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were abused. Some of them claimed to have been raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. Indeed, the protégés were held by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhumane conditions," said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, were chained in a small room.
According to the information, the Koran School has existed for about ten years. Residents had drawn the attention of the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents were shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran School, said Sabo. They did not suspect the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
There are many private Koran schools in the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria. They replace the often deficient state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to the neighbouring state of Niger over the past ten months.
Chained and Tortured: Nigeria's Police Free 400 Children from School
Police officers released almost 400 students from appalling conditions in a school in northern Nigeria. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries indicating torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
The children had been discovered there on Thursday after a note in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "unworthy of man". The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, had been held at their school like slaves and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television pictures showed emaciated and injured pupils in a clearly bad health condition.
World football choice: further accusations after Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the world football association Fifa awards the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua’s captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, accusations came from other countries to the Fifa. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious reason.
Much of FIFA has proven to be offensive in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Footballers' Election has not been suspected of going wrong - except that the national coaches and national team captains with voting rights of the member associations often vote for sympathy rather than objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua’s captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
The fifa apologized that "the signatures on the election forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid". They had contacted the Egyptian association several times to clarify the situation - without reply.
Sudan's coach also amazed
There is also an outcry about the election from Sudan. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote in the way it was finally judged: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in two and Sadio Mané in three. According to Fifa, the vote was received just as well, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also made accusations: "Didn't vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my vote is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted in his name.
On Friday, the association reported: True, but of course it was not intentional. The completed election documents were "mistakenly" provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, according to a message from the association. However, the second captain had actually elected Manuel Rosas. "We assume responsibility for the administrative error," said the news. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "just as it is on the official FIFA list".
The other cases are now being examined by Fifa in an investigation, but stresses that the election process has been supervised externally by PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world football election - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: High-ranking Republicans speak out for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly spoken out for an official investigation against US President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are being ascertained." He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump Biden has been observing "for years".
The Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump for the whistleblower affair, only a few have shown discomfort. Scott’s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already repeatedly turned against Trump’s policies, for example, against easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. “It’s a deeply disturbing situation,” Baker said. “The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it.”
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. states, have no formal say in the proceedings against Trump, which are decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. Nevertheless, the first Republican senators have also expressed criticism of the situation. For example, Mitt Romney, who represents the State of Utah in the Second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing".
The affair could result in the initiation of an impeachment procedure against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation on this, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could exert a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on an actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The chances of success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US President has been removed from office by an impeachment procedure.
Were torturers on board of Rackete's Sea Watch?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, reportedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had unlawfully launched the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After intense protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious accusations against Rackete are being made. Thus, three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3". The suspects were arrested in a detention centre in Messina (Sicily) after migrants recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot exclude this, but have no reliable information about it," said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured, and even murdered. They were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A. (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence," the report said.
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes onto the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," Neugebauer said. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee Libya. It is therefore quite likely that perpetrators will also be on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is investigated."
Italy's right-wing ex-Interior Minister Matteo Salvini immediately asked Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aiding illegal immigration, to apologize.
Musk strives for delivery record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
The demand was strong, so Tesla could register 110,000 orders, according to Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customers. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares were out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased so strongly in almost four months. Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its current best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit figures have to be produced for this in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but profit margins are low here. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
US budget dispute: Once again only a bridge financing
The new financial year will start in the United States on October 1st without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional funding until November 21st.
Although US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in spending ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States will once again be without spending plans before the new fiscal year, which begins on October 1st. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until November 21st. Without such a decision, a shutdown would have taken place on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump still has to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal administration will now be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019, which will end on Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 expenditure laws in time, which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the federal administration cannot benefit for the time being from the expenditure framework extended for the new financial year from 1.3 bio. to 1.4 bio. $.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. However, the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are barely viable.
In the Senate, the Republicans seem to be trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the Wall, one of President Trump’s major priorities. The Democrats are disturbed by the plans for the Wall and its financing, which is actually planned for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the Wall had already escalated in December 2018 and led to a 35-day shutdown.
The Spirits Divorce at the Wall Building
It is currently unclear how the parties intend to approach this issue. An extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November is more likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks. A shutdown is also not excluded.
Against the background of Congress’ continuing inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas to automate the process gain popularity. Template p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue the federal administration’s funding at the previous year’s level, prevent parliamentarians’ travel activities and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans were available.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization will also be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the National Assembly of Paris voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill whereby all women can claim in vitro fertilisation, which is likely to significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donation.
The proposal still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that numerous "children without a father" could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core element of a bioethics law that Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as a "opportunity" for society. It depicts the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the costs of artificial insemination for all women are to be borne by social security.
Fertilization with semen from dead husband continues to be prohibited
On the other hand, the National Assembly with a narrow majority rejected an amendment to give widows access to the semen of their dead husbands for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination is allowed "post-mortem". In the past, there were cases in Germany in which women complained in vain of the delivery of the semen of a deceased. Opponents of the advance in Paris argued that such a begotten child would then bear a "particularly severe fate".
Many members of the governing party La République en Marche (The Republic on the move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had opposed the idea of artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be subjected to "double grief" if the death of her husband also left her wish for a child unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can be fertilized with the semen of an unknown person in the future, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial insemination in France is only permitted to heterosexual couples who cannot father children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would remain prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women, but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: Calls for flight tax for universities are getting louder
A lot is being flown at the universities. Therefore, the country wants to have a climate tax paid there in the future, too. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also limit themselves when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The debate on a climate tax on flights from universities and colleges, which was postponed before the summer break, is getting back on track. After the state rectors’ conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint declaration, the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university are pleading for compensation for service flights. This is the first step "urgently necessary", at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, according to their statement. Meanwhile, the cabinet decision originally planned in July is still on ice, because the CDU has still not approved the submission of the Greens.
Russia again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB secret service, the prisoners were reported to have illegally fished in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 North Korean fishermen were arrested. At that time, there was a firefight between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. North Korean fishermen were thus traveling in Russian territorial waters. According to their own information, the coast guard of Russia is patrolling their marine biological resources.
30,000 squids seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 squids were discovered and seized on the boats. Furthermore, three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and brought to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia’s fishing authority had not issued any fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even after lawsuits by local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of North Korean fishermen have already been arrested there for some time this year.
Georgi Martynov, head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, recently also complained of high ecological damage by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow-meshed synthetic nets that were banned in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed.
Only 18,000 more in the future: USA lowers asylum ceiling
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is sealing itself off from those seeking protection: as State Department in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal immigration of refugees will be further lowered. In future, especially threatened believers and Iraqis will receive asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees once again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the US State Department declared. In the now almost expired marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the willingness to accept protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under Barack Obama’s predecessor government, the reception limits had been much higher.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. Refugee Program in 1980. Nevertheless, the State Department described the U.S. as "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation strongly reminiscent of the language used by the incumbent U.S. President.
Trump explained that a "responsible approach" to refugees is aimed at enabling refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild them. He is much encouraged by supporters for his hard course in migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
One big issue is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to seal off. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and the current domestic policy developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure due to the Selensky affair and a potentially impending impeachment procedure.
According to the Foreign Office, the U.S. government intends to focus on the admission of two groups of refugees in the future: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and have thereby come into danger, as the State Department statement shows. On the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be admitted from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The US wants to ensure that people from this "northern triangle" of Central America in particular apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States only signed migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration at the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred from the former zoo of Buenos Aires to a collection station for apes in the USA at the request of the Argentine court. The "Sandra", born in 1986 in the Rostock Zoo, was granted the rights of a "non-human person", therefore her release is mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas by direct flight on Thursday evening - however not as a passenger, but in the cargo compartment, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram human monkey is unable to adapt to life in the wild, she is to live in the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", formerly pet of pop star Michael Jackson. However, before moving to Florida, "Sandra" has to endure a 40-day quarantine at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" fundamental rights, which was initiated by animal protectionists in 2014, helped to transform the zoo of Buenos Aires into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and education centre for the preservation of biodiversity was to be established there.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineers: 550 metres in 46 minutes
The extreme climber Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new Hussar ride at the almost 3000 meter high Great Peak in the Italian Alps.
Without grid, double ground or other aids, the Swiss defeated the 550-meter-high north face of the Great Peak in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute vertigo, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. Thus, he undercut the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sports goods manufacturer Nike recorded a significant increase in profit. Net profit rose to $1.4 billion in the past quarter (just under €1.3 billion), which is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor addresses its customers directly online.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period up to the end of August. Nike sales grew most strongly with an increase of 22 percent in China. As a result, the Beaverton Group in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited in the People’s Republic of China from its approach of addressing consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Head of Finance Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to drive the "digital transformation" of the sporting goods manufacturer with strategic investments, thus enhancing its competitive advantage. Investors responded with satisfaction to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sporting goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifetime stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital imposed a life-long stadium ban on a fan. The Brazilian defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing with AS Rome since 2016.
The club reacted late Thursday. He had reported the account of the fan to Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma adherent should never visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. One has to identify the responsible and throw them out of the stadiums", Fifa President Gianni Infantino said on the weekend. The reason for the statement was racist chants in the First League play between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florence last Sunday.
But there had also been discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 rioting fans of record champion Juventus Turin. Four of them should no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed. For the rest, prohibitions of four to seven years apply.
The fans are connected with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus. The twelve are accused of, among other things, severe blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had started the investigation with an advertisement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are supposed to be behind the black trade in tickets. They would have "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and were supposed to have blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, generation Z is political - whole years are considered with catchy terms. If one looks more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective lifestyle of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" With this call, the crab catch at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun officially started on September 21. This also heralded the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Department of Public Relations of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ecologically ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The magnificent natural environment of Gaochun offers its residents all the conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun have already started to breed crabs in the early 1990s. Over the years, the crab industry has developed into a formative industry that has provided high incomes and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has been actively involved in large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming and in technology-based crab farming. And the city has taken care of promoting more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform to "distribution of power, optimization of administration and government services" and has carefully built up the service network for "authorizations under one roof, a law enforcement team, a network for services, a platform for lending" to fully optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the local benefits of being connected to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, making use of the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as a flagship for intelligent high-end production companies, biomedicine and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, cultural and health industries, and organic farming companies leading the "3+2" sector. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the establishment of a national tourism zone covering all areas and tourist resorts of national importance, integrating the environmental and cultural resources of the Gaochun landscape, improving the state of buildings for civic services and the public service, vigorously developing the "Tourism +" and "+ Tourism" areas, and advancing the development of cultural tourism at a high quality level. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Conflict between Iran and the US: Ruhani speaks of end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, on his return from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions. In return for talks with the Tehran leadership, the United States had promised an end to all sanctions, Ruhani said on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian counterpart via Twitter: "I wanted Iran to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the events as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and pressed for a meeting to take place. "And America says I am lifting the sanctions," added Ruhani. The nature of the sanctions that should be ended has been the subject of debate. "And they have clearly said that we are lifting all sanctions."
Ruhani criticized, however, that this move had not taken place in an acceptable way. In view of the current punitive measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated with Russia and China, which is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump on the margins of the UN General Assembly.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After two earthquakes shook western Turkey within a very short time, the fear of a catastrophe is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday. This increases the concern for a catastrophe.
Fourteen schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons and hundreds of buildings were damaged. The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 shook the Marmara region off Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the metropolis of millions. Oktay announced that the government wanted to use a commission to prepare the country for earthquakes better in the future.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, badly built houses collapse - among other things, the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
For years, urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning that large open areas that have been registered as refuges in the centre have long since been built up. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August, the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineers had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the earthquake of Thursday was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometres, as reported by the civil protection authority Afad. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu announced on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. State TV channel TRT showed people who ran out of the houses in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in the Silivri district for security reasons. Some students cried, as shown in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly at risk of earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly earthquakes was in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of the magnitudes 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. However, it is unclear when the earthquake will occur. During the earthquake on Thursday it hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags packed with everything necessary to stand next to front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wobbles. When the next big quake comes, it is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom), according to which two minarets of mosques collapsed in the Avcilar and Sariyer districts.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
On the social networks many users report panic. Buildings wobbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Klinik, warned about aftershocks via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official data, the time of the quake is indicated at 1:59 p.m. (local time). According to CNN Turkey, only a few minutes after the first quake, there was an aftershock, which was reported at 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt until Istanbul. Also its epicentre was located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the disaster protection authority Afad informed already on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a major earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now. He said to CNN Türk that it had become more likely. "These could be the signs of a major earthquake," said Ersoy to the transmitter. "The big quake will come sooner or later."
Already a few weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake caused great concern in Istanbul. In Albania there had also been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also at Lake Constance the earth had trembled this year.
Parliament: New Ignition Substance in Ukraine Affair
Two explosive documents are fuelling the Ukraine affair over possible abuse of US President Donald Trump’s power. On the way to a possible impeachment procedure, the US Democrats see themselves strengthened: the complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial telephone conversation with the Ukrainian president contain important evidence for investigations against the President. Trump once again sees himself as a victim of a “witch hunt”. Moreover, he doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passengers locked in the toilet - Rerouted Airplanes
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight has been diverted by United Airlines. The toilet door had been blocked from Washington to San Francisco during flight 1554, the airline reported according to US media.
At an extra-scheduled stopover in Denver on Wednesday evening (local time), the woman was finally freed from the narrow cabin. She was detained in it for about an hour, wrote U.S. media citing other passengers. To continue her flight to San Francisco, passengers had to change planes.
In a video distributed on the Internet, which is supposed to come from flight 1554 according to the US media, you can see how several people try to free the woman. "We are currently working to open the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline has apologized to all passengers. It was open at first whether the woman will receive compensation.
The cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "Die Verwandlung", British success author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "The Cockroach" (original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on 27 November, Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) reported. This is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his former life but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into action and is determined to let nothing and nobody stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers shamelessly lie like the Soviet leaders once, if Brexiteers in high positions almost implore the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to it: write." McEwan had only appeared in the spring of the novel "Machines Like Me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafka's story, first published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who one morning wakes up and looks "turned into a tremendous vermin", is gradually excluded from family and society and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that stands head," says Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests EUR 9.5 million in Austria's rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary receive whisper brakes to reduce noise pollution from freight trains. In addition, sections of the rail connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions.The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until 31.October
The German tour operator Thomas Cook canceled all trips until 31 October 2019, including 31 October 2019, one day after his insolvency application. Travels could not be started "for insolvency reasons", the company informed on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings made by the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which are already paid or fully paid. The company left open the way for travel with a start starting on 1 November 2019. In coordination with insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the throttle of the bankruptcy of the British parent company and had filed for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen among others, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to transfer money to hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday hotels abroad, which currently still host Thomas Cook holidaymakers, will receive money from Zurich Insurance. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked to make extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without presentation of separate invoices, hotels in the holiday resorts should now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and provided that Thomas Cook travelers are not required to pay individual hotel bills or otherwise by these hotels from now on," said spokesperson Bernd Engelien.
The insurance company responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay for their own accommodation on site. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres strongly criticised this.
How many hotels are affected will be coordinated with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, said the insurance spokesman. According to information from Thursday, 70 000 Thomas Cook package holidaymakers from Germany were still on the road. Zurich Germany has secured holiday and return journey of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the now announced hotel payouts by Zurich Insurance only help travellers who are currently on the move. It looks bad for Thomas Cook customers who still want to fly on holiday. Late Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips up to and including 31 October would be cancelled. This also applies to bookings that have already been paid.
The company left open how it is about travel with a start from 1 November 2019. In coordination with insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined. In principle, Zurich insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosive mine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued Lady Diana’s engagement. In Africa, he is now directly following in the footsteps of his mother.
In Angola, the British Prince Harry has detonated and destroyed an explosive mine with a blue splinter protection vest.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the site of Dirico, he set up the ignition circuit on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded in the savannah landscape without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to walk directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same detonator, who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to take the path she was taking at that time. Princess Diana’s paintings, on which Princess Diana walked through a cleared minefield in 1997, had gone around the world. She, too, had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Staggering Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that with him there is no guarantee of a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements have been made by the polarizing British for ever. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in Britain floats like a sword of Damocles over the Blondshopf. His suspension of parliament to be able to conduct its Brexit course stubbornly until the date of departure was cancelled earlier this week. And a bill passed by parliament obliges Johnson to effect an extension of bilateral talks until 31 October in case of failed negotiations with the EU. Johnson, however, had categorically ruled out this again and again.
Boris Johnson thinks deal is still possible
But the pressure does not seem to go past Johnson. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he made suggestions that if he did not agree, he would support an extension of the negotiations by the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is running out for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators have about six weeks left to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. However, the recent talks have again failed to achieve a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine at the moment. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a new postponement of the date of departure is in place. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister’s words. It fears that Johnson might somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US authorities: Further deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of e-cigarettes in the US has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and likely injured in this context, the US health authority CDC reported. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", there were already more than 900 affected persons, about 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. So far no similar increase in lung damage is known in Europe. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the US.
Fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Mohammed Ali’s videos have been divided into online networks millions of times, and the Spanish-based builder and actor calls for a “people’s revolution” in this. For Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass demonstrations with one million participants in central places in the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. There was already an increased police presence in the centre of Cairo. Several subway stations were closed, streets around central Tahrir Square were closed. Already in the past days, the police had stepped up their road controls and the pedestrians' mobile phones were partially searched on news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura there had been protests with hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted harshly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them have been arbitrarily arrested - just because they were "at the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW reported on appeal to lawyers arrested.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country. According to this, the government in Cairo has blocked websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has been ruling the country since 2013 after overthrowing the democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of the government, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially condemned in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fox of Greenland Expedition back
Polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. On his arrival in the port of Hamburg, he was greeted by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic with the racing yacht "Malizia".
In recent months, Fuchs and a team of scientists have been investigating and documenting the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar researcher. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to speak out. One has known for decades that the earth is warming up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under the exclusion of the public", said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of global warming and the waste of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, Greenland glacier ice had been measured with a drone and fished with nets for microplastics, they said.
During the Hamburg Climate Week, the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" for his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans". "Arved Fuchs is a great role model for all of us who care about the survival of the oceans," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades."
Expensive Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: that seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill with 80 euros tip included was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
"Such cases damage the reputation of Rome. We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," a spokesman for Federagit, the Association of Travel Guides in Rome, demanded, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The reaction of the owners of the restaurant came promptly. The Japanese women not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified themselves. However, this is not to be taken from the bill. Also a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, the innkeeper said.
A phone call to Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could actually face an impeachment procedure after the turbulent revelations of the past days, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the talk is from weeks until a decision is made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the telephone conversation with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Selenskyy. The accusation of the whistleblower, who finally brought the conversation out of concern for the national security and for the democracy of the USA with his complaint to the public, is monstrous: The president had abused the power of his office in order to instrumentalize the government of another country for influencing the election 2020. He had used the dependence of Ukraine in extortion and wanted to force them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be understood in the now published transcript of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full text. However, the phone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, in which apart from Trump, his personal lawyer is mainly at the center: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins in May 2019 when the New York Times reports Rudy Giuliani’s travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet with President Selensky in Kiev, who has just been elected, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are tricky. “We don’t interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation, which is what we have the right to,” he says to the newspaper. One might think it’s inappropriate, but “there’s nothing illegal about it.” Giuliani wants investigations to be pursued in Ukraine, for which there is hardly any basis – “because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and could prove to be helpful to my government.”
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have infected themselves with right-wing conspiracy fantasies that are fixed on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for the Russian investigation in the US. However, this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will be talking so prominently about on the phone with Selenskyi in July. Giulianis and the President’s version reads: former Vice President Joe Biden, currently a promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidate, had urged the dismissal of the then Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Shokin as the Obama administration’s Ukraine representative, in order to stop the investigation of the gas company he was responsible for, on whose board his son Hunter Biden was active. Biden senior had extorted Ukraine financially to cover up the corrupt machinations of his family.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General leave, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Moreover, Shokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt conduct, the US government was far from the only Western partner pushing for his release. Moreover, the Obama administration explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Disorders on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. According to this, Germany, Great Britain and Spain in particular are affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has not been charging again and again since about 3.30 p.m. Instagram also reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the malfunction, although not to date to the same extent.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by disturbances
This is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services were cancelled for several hours. And as in previous cases, users use Twitter as their main source of trouble.
Polish scientists saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the Antarctic ice. They were on their way with a dinghy and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for the recovery.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we received the news, at just before ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the inflatable".
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977 and 19 scientists work there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NEVER recharge wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently entered the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If a mobile phone is normally charged by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. In case of wireless charging, the researchers, however, have always measured more than 30 degrees even when the smartphone is perfectly aligned on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is somewhat beside the coil, the temperature increases even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad increases, which in turn drives the power consumption up.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but also does not last that long. Thus, the service life is reduced. The researchers therefore advise that the smartphone should always be charged by cable. Since a battery exchange with modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently even increased the cost of a battery exchange once again - and indeed for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels as well as cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and tedious plug-fumble. Since Qi (which stands for inductive energy transmission) is a worldwide standard, in which Apple exceptionally participates, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau-Photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese climber reportedly climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) had reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition operator announced.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has made international headlines before: from him comes a photo of climbers who are standing in line on Mount Everest.
The image of the mass crowd sparked a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848-meter-high mountain and highest summit of the earth. In May, eleven climbers had died during the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. One reason for this is the bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to enable him to ascend.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman announced on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned".
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers, on whose land the animals had previously kept themselves harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka. In theory, the death penalty is due to their killing.
British oil tanker out of Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its establishment by Iran. According to the news agency IRNA, the seafaring agency Bandar Abbas announced this. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had established the tanker flying the British flag on 19 July under the charge of having disregarded regulations of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf.
Thomas Cook’s Management in Criticism
The responsible economic committee of the lower house wants to investigate the bankruptcy of the travel giant Thomas Cook comprehensively. It is about the salary packages of the executive board as well as the question why the British government did not want to financially contribute to the company struggling for survival. "Our interest is the supervision in the company as well as the control by external accountants", informed the committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London. "Obviously we are dealing with a bad example of management greed".
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of colon cancer
The role of genes in the family-increased risk of colorectal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg conclude this in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are therefore probably more severe than previously assumed. DKFZ scientists stress that this has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of colorectal cancer.
Elon Musk Raises Tesla Shares
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". Demand was strong, so Tesla could register 110,000 orders, according to Musk's newsletter.
The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to customers. Tesla had to provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares were out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased so strongly in almost four months. Tesla delivered a good 95’000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its current best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. Six-digit figures have to be produced for this in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but profit margins are low here. Despite the boom, there have been last losses.
Will British Government Avoid Brexit Law? Johnson Reticence
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covering up whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the law recently passed by parliament against an unregulated Brexit. On Friday, he simply said to journalists that his government would abide by the law in force.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law until after the EU exit.
Johnson said he wanted a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Iran appears to be ramping up uranium enrichment
Iran’s President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. “Unfortunately, European states show inability or unwillingness when it comes to concrete actions,” said Rohani at a press conference on the fringes of the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday. In the event that they did not stand by their promises, he promised “further steps” away from the agreements of the laboriously negotiated agreement of 2015.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which contained the promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the US unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in order to force Iran to change course with "maximum pressure" in the Middle East policy considered aggressive. President Donald Trump's government wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now again relying on harsh sanctions against Tehran. Iran recently responded by resuming the uranium enrichment limited by the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic now uses or has prepared for use the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 additional centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans were not willing to bear their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and burden of oppressive US sanctions, Rouhani conjectured. However, there would still be further talks that hopefully would bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia, the situation changed in mid-September: Germany, France and Great Britain followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had committed themselves to the attack, which was considered a false commitment by the US. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this," said Rouhani. However, the European leaders could not have done so during the talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they would have only claimed that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration would first have to be lifted, Rohani demanded. He called on the government in Washington to turn to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet of other star crosses solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space, which they had previously succeeded in. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was only a guess at the beginning is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was christened after its discoverer to 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The far-traveled comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres in diameter. Follow-up of various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not originate from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is after 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017 only the second interstellar object, which was sighted during a passing of our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get close insights into a foreign solar system before it never disappears again. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet resembles that of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. "The current velocity of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is at this distance clearly above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the Sun," reported Davide Farnocchia from the U.S. Space Agency Nasa in a communication.
According to the analyses, the comet travels on a hyperbolic orbit that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as reported by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was initially listed under catalogue number C/2019 Q4, received the designation 2I/Borisov from it, whereby the first part of the name indicates that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov was already sighted in approach. Thus, the researchers remain for many months for investigations. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explained Farnocchia. "After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers in a first examination. Images of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles those of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form by similar processes as in our colleague Javier Licandro, added de León.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years indicates that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how often such visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly be intercepted by a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
The agency wants to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (German for example comet interceptor) at a waiting position at a distance of 1.5 million kilometres from the Earth until 2028. According to Esa science director Günther Hasinger, it is either to lurk for a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or for an interstellar visitor like 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Just in time before the People's Republic's 70th birthday, the time has come: On the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger aircraft of China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are expected to be handled at the new airport each year, and by 2025 it is expected to be 72 million. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China’s latest prestige project is also known as the “starfish” because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which are to be expanded to seven later and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly stated that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, and which has been much smaller, has so far been postponed. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger plane landed after only four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - this is what the British space agency UK Space Agency is dreaming of. The aim is to make this supersonic flight (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) designed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire possible, the US station CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely accomplish this," said agency chief Graham Turnock to the station. "We are talking about the 2030 years for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency intends to work more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport to date, the Concorde covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 to the end of its operation in 2003, taking three to three and a half hours. In 2000, an accident occurred when a Concorde was launched at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, where all 109 passengers were killed. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft together with the US space agency Nasa, the "X-Plane". Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines on his homepage, among other things. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation of truly reusable framing devices".
Riot in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by the US President, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," Trump said on Thursday in front of employees of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and one had dealt with such in the past "a bit different" than today.
This was regarded as an attempt to intimidate tippers. The event was not actually public. However, several US media broadcasted audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the President’s statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives announced preparations for an impeachment trial against Trump on Tuesday. Their accusations are based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who is making serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. On great public pressure, the whistleblower’s statements were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to have received information from several government officials that the U.S. president "uses the power of his office" to ensure that another country interferes in the 2020 U.S. election in his favor.
At the heart of the accusations is a controversial telephone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about former business of Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian judiciary. Biden is ahead of the race for the democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to the Ukraine telephone call: leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic text protocol had been prepared. However, this had been removed from a database normally provided for this purpose after the conversation was conducted by White House lawyers, and instead stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known, and the New York Times reported that it was an employee of the CIA foreign intelligence agency.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had distributed second-hand information that had turned out to be incorrect. Therefore, there might be no tippers or spies at all.
However, as Trump expressed in New York about those who were supposed to have leaked information to the whistleblower, he was indignant. Nancy Pelosi, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives, reacted with concern and lamented that Trump's statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives several investigations against Trump and his environment have been going on for months in various committees. In view of the allegations of Ukraine, the Democrats are now advancing investigations with new force in order to initiate a possible impeachment procedure against Trump.
"The whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff. Trump sharply attacked Schiff, accused him of misrepresenting things and again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insults Schiff and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy fields, mostly under democratic, but also under republican presidents, stood behind the democrats’ investigation for a possible impeachment trial in a statement published on Friday. If the allegations were true, it would be "an unscrupulous abuse of power" by Trump, it said.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could exert a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The chances of success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no U.S. President has been removed from office by an impeachment procedure.
VW works council: jobs are being "slowly" dismantled
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern drives the works council of the car manufacturer. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from ten billion euros to 2023 by two billion euros. Of these, 500 million euros are to be saved already this year.
The "Future Pact" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be dismantled at the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security is valid until 2029.
However, as our newspaper has learned from works council circles, jobs in production, which were not actually at the disposition, are being "sneakly" dismantled by another way - i.e. by the official course. Thus, regular vacancies that become vacant are often not filled again.
In these cases, the works council had no way of forcing re-occupation. Meanwhile, in many places there was a lack of personnel, which was increasing work compression, the worries about a gradual bleeding out of the vehicle plants became greater. This also raised the fear that the vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. VW only said: "An adjustment of the employment volume takes place as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardise production worldwide even more and control new projects centrally. This is also intended to reduce costs and speed up decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production Executive Board member Andreas Tostmann said at a management conference in Berlin: "In times of uncertainty from Brexit to the impending trade war between the US and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof."
There are already successes on this path: for example, this year, production costs per vehicle would decrease for the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. Tostmann said to journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will be reduced by 1.1 hours.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg parent plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb is that 800,000 cars have to be built there every year to ensure that the plant is satisfactorily profitable. However, in 2018, the capacity utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the declining demand for diesel and the problems with the conversion to the new WLTP fuel consumption and exhaust gas test procedure.
However, as Production Board member Tostmann announced last year, one million cars are to be "perspectively" rolled off the production line in Wolfsburg. This is intended to facilitate the bundling of the golf production at the main plant - because the Zwickau plant hands over the golf production through the conversion to the location for the e-car production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are being produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations are now resting on Golf 8. Despite all efforts to build up e-mobility, it is intended to remain the bread and butter car of Wolfsburg for the time being.
Forced prostitution with Voodoo: Traffickers Sentenced
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn in, sent to the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six suspected human traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six suspected Nigerian traffickers were sentenced to probation and imprisonment of up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday. The accused had sent young women from Nigeria to the Ruhr area and forced them to become prostitutes. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerian women who wanted to leave had to take a ritual vow in front of a voodoo priest in their homeland.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in inflatable boats. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. Arriving in Germany, they were distributed among various brothels in order to work out the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25 000 euros.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the smuggling and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women to brothels in the trial. "The work made the women physically and mentally difficult to do," said judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. "Some were rightly disgusted."
The verdicts are that foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and severe forced prostitution are being smuggled in by trade and gang.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the cabin crew union Ufo once again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "inform about the industrial action in the LH Group on October 14th," said Ufo tariff board member Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with the Ufo Group for months. This also concerns the question of whether the trade union has legally terminated collective agreements at Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the appeal against it. "I consider it unlikely that a second court would see the matter completely differently," said Ufo board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa had also submitted an application to the Regional Labour Court in Frankfurt to have the status of UFO as a trade union reviewed in court. The company argues that the trade union has not appointed a representative board for months and is therefore not in a position to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
There was a fierce leadership dispute in the divisional union, during which numerous members of the board and the advisory board resigned, including the long-time union leader Nicoley Baublies. Ufo had suspended a preliminary vote on strikes by cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts about its leadership.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but this is about to change. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia is aiming to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the Tourism Commission announced that it would increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, Chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult to access for tourists. Visas are usually given only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the ErzkonservativeKingdom hopes for more income from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. Subsequently, national oil production collapsed dramatically, fueling oil prices. It should take several weeks for the Kingdom’s oil production to reach its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber in preparation for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in their Instagram Stories on Thursday (local time) on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelorette party in Los Angeles according to the People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful suits printed with bananas on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me to choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to get married in church next weekend.
A year ago, the Biebers gave themselves the "yes" word in a New York registry office. At that time, there had not been a bigger festival.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the town of Mecin (Metschin), the police reported. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening, after the crew had sent an emergency signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also in use during the search. The cause of the accident still has to be determined. The crash location is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also causes of the threat, reported the World Union for the Conservation of Nature IUCN in Brussels on Friday. It examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of these are not found on any other continent. Of these 265 are at risk 58 percent. 66 are already at the highest level of risk and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "strongly endangered", " threatened with extinction" and "extinctly extinct" in nature. In total, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
Chestnuts and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) are especially threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It also looks bad for the wild ordinary horse chestnuts. They have been considered "endangered" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat besides a fungus is the Balkan mini moth. Since the 1980s it has spread from south-eastern Europe across the continent and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 specimens. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Shrub species and mosses also in danger
At the same time, IUCN scientists created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wild, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important food source for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Bureau. "We must limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority".
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 injured reported
Thirty-four people were injured in the recent earthquake in Turkey. According to the reports, there were no deaths. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have therefore been damaged. Since the quake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 shook the Marmara region off Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the million metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. In the last 20 years Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly at risk of earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates.
One of the most serious earthquakes was one of 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicentre was located in Gölcük, southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed.
Already on Tuesday a quake of 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the mid-term show
Latin-pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. The singers announced this on Twitter. "It won't be any bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is incredibly excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be time in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that since 1996 she had dreamt of performing at the Super Bowl - back then she saw Diana Ross fly to the sky at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL exists 100 years and I will perform with another Latina". She could hardly wait "to show what we girls can do on the world's biggest stage".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she was honored to be standing next to another artist on one of the largest stages in the world and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and all over the world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "Queens" stood together on a stage.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling audiences
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the USA. Even though you have recently dropped audience numbers: This February, the spectacle attracted the fewest viewers in the USA for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
The mid-term show of the previous Super Bowl had been upsetting in the run-up: In the dispute over the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, top stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the mid-term show - the reviews were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had fallen to his knees in the 2016/17 season before NFL games in the national anthem in protest against police violence and racism. Kaepernick triggered a movement with his protest, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the mostly African-American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been unaffiliated since March 2017 and has no longer contested NFL games. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook-Plot: Hotels get money from the insurance
According to a press report, some banks are likely to face the bankruptcy of the travel provider Thomas Cook. High write-offs on outstanding bonds and loans are threatening. Credit Suisse is also affected by this, writes the "Financial Times" in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to write down a total of up to £1.8 billion (around €2 billion) on their books, the report says. Estimates by the consulting firm AlixPartners would have shown this.
The creditors of bonds would have to accept write-offs of 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the lenders between 550 and 825 million pounds. The amounts actually to be written off are likely to be at the upper end of the ranges, one expert told the paper.
The extent to which the creditors’ losses will actually be in the end will be evident after the insolvency proceedings have ended. A person close to this procedure did not radiate too much hope. For example, Thomas Cook’s approximately 40 aircraft in Great Britain are “old” and many of the properties are in bad locations. The most money can probably be obtained with the sale of the airport slots as well as the Thomas Cook brand, it was further stated.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
The Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but we have no secure information about it ourselves," said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy, accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators had been arrested in the detention centre in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organisations could not verify who they left on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29th, and had rammed a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects were reported to have arrived there. The captain is being investigated for aiding illegal immigration.
USA warn federal government against Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government not to trust the Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe the risks are too high," said Pai to the "Handelsblatt" with regard to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that obliges any company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow instructions from the security authorities.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," said the FCC chief. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to demand a "declaration of trust" from suppliers.
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" on the basis of its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology is not just hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," Pai said.
It would be "very difficult to imagine" that a government agency, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership is opaque, and the employee company that supposedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told the "Handelsblatt."
The U.S. had insights into how government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the position of the U.S.
Chemical plant in northern France burns: schools closed
At night residents hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky above a North French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - the clean-up work could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities the facilities would not be opened on Friday as a precaution, the responsible prefecture informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not expose themselves to smoke. There were no injured. Farmers and breeders were called on to bring their animals inside, to protect their food and to stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still the risk that smell will spread after the deletion, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters as well as 90 police officers and gendarmes were in use at the site of the fire.
A gigantic black smoke column had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol, which manufactures additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso near Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The prefect of Normandy, Pierre-André Durand, told the news station BFMTV that at first no "high toxicity" had been detected in samples. However, pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. Dams against pollution had been built in the river, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 2:40 p.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
The French Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is faltering, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens in order to make the necessary decisions".
Action would have to be taken by those states that have budgetary margins for more investment, Le Maire said, among other things, with regard to Germany.
France does not have these margins, the Minister added, pointing to the country's high public debt, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French public debt must be "stabilised" and "reduced", Le Maire said.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investment to stimulate the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly asked France to control its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government is thus responding, among other things, to the protests of the Yellow Vest movement. New debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson avoids question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises Parliament's "Capitulation Act".
Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. Critics fear, however, that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. However, the Tory politician does not respond to this possibility.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covered by whether he wants to impose an unregulated Brexit, despite the law recently passed by parliament, which is exactly what should prevent it. On a corresponding question, Johnson simply told journalists that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had speculated that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law until after the EU exit. Johnson said he was aspiring to a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Meanwhile, Johnson's chief consultant Dominic Cummings said that he felt that the political conflicts over Brexit were a "walk in the park" and that he was confident that the desired EU exit would still be achieved: "We enjoy it, we will win, we will leave the EU, don't worry", said Cummings, the British newspaper "Telegraph" during a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the election campaign before the EU referendum in 2016, is now acting as the chief strategist in the British government seat Downing Street. He is said to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister into an almost hopeless situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (pockets) plunges deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the illustrated book "The Polaroid Diaries" at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September. Among the illustrious guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretender's front woman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as a dedicated artist and the immediate magic of Polaroid film."
Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found her way to photography, always had the camera with her. Thousands of Polaroids she made, a few hundred of them are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, there is always one in the focus: Her husband Paul - as perhaps he has never been seen before.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on the shoulders, telephones in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the spotlight on their farm in southern England or in Scotland also led a completely normal life. So Mary McCartney said according to the BBC that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had made out of old potato boxes. And it was not always tidy with the McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney’s recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the deciding click: You have to realize if a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you take two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the ability to capture exactly the right moment at all times. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the cut-out and the colours are right, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure in addition to the anecdotal, where landscapes look like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly released Beatles album "Abbey Road", which was released exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from its neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop the import of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had "retired due to the US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" towards the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the US, Iran secretly pursues a nuclear program and does not adhere to the agreement.
Its sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably.
US government wants to restrict reception of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. On Thursday, the U.S. State Department declared that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be lowered from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees. This corresponds to a cut of 40 percent.
The State Department stated that while the US would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, the main task was to protect US citizens and serve them. Currently, the US immigration system is overburdened.
In the future, the US government will focus on the reception of two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have thus come into danger, as the State Department statement shows. However, a maximum of 1500 refugees will be admitted from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The programme, launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the US. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the budget year 2020 would be the lowest in the programme’s history. The current ceiling of 30,000 is already a low. When US President Donald Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the figure was almost 85,000.
Relief agencies reacted horribly to the announced lowering of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The US would continue to damage its leadership role in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration into the US – both legally and illegally – according to the US government, 350,000 asylum applications are expected for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Get Close to a Spokesman"
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage. Whoever has given evidence to the informant who accuses him of abuse of power, "comes close to a spy," Trump said, according to a recording of a private event in New York on Thursday. Several U.S. media reports this in agreement.
According to this, Trump spoke to employees of the United States mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, "This is close to a snitch." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayals, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now."
Observers evaluated the latter comment on a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats strongly criticized Trump’s statements and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. It was also an attempt to obstruct a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment procedure against him, the chairmen of the Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervisory Committees in the House of Representatives wrote.
The whistleblower accuses the president of having abused his office in a complaint that has now been published in order to request interference from another country in the US election in 2020. Specifically, his controversial phone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyi in the summer is one of the issues: In the conversation Trump advised him to initiate investigations against his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any wrongdoing.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower himself and his informant are. However, as reported by the New York Times, the whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of the CIA foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat capsized: Baby and toddlers drown in Aegean Sea
People try again and again to come across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. The boats, which are often too small, regularly capsize. Seven migrants have died during the sinking of a inflatable boat - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed when a inflatable was destroyed. Among the deaths were a baby and four other children, reported the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women and five men were thus rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also said to be a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not known from which countries the migrants come from. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey transfer to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in way too small boats. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The Who Cancels Concert
A US concert by the rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end due to an indisposition of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston his voice failed to serve. Daltrey told the audience in the eighth song: "I think I should leave it while it is still going".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for an apology and added that Daltrey "can't really talk now." Townsend promised the audience to get their money's worth at a reparation concert. However, an appointment has not yet been made.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver scheduled performances canceled The Who. They are to be made up at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from a small startup to a driving force in the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis.
The crisis of the office rental company WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the world’s largest real estate markets. A few days ago, the company had sold founder Adam Neumann as CEO, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for executives to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British Financial Times reports that WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new leases with immediate effect. Thus, among other things, the largest tenant of office space in New York and London is suddenly off the market.
WeWork leases large office space in the long term and leases it to members in small units at short notice. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has been burning money with this business at breathtaking speed. Last year, the company made a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year, the rental costs alone are said to have risen to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars due to the rental of ever-new large areas. In order to limit the loss, the new management is now supposed to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped the rental of new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded lease agreements with maturities of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, has rented almost 300,000 square meters of office space over the past 24 months. WeWork’s new contracts alone made sure that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the newly launched areas at that time. Without WeWork’s expansion, the office vacancy in the U.S. metropolis would have risen at that time, as Alpert wrote in the “Business Insider”.
Even in the British capital, the balance on the real estate market could shift noticeably without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis bought last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have converted their properties with high investments to meet the requirements of WeWork. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners would probably have to write off part of the billion-dollar income they had hoped for. Despite the long-term leases, they do not have access to the - in any case - reserves of WeWork. As a rule, the rental of the individual locations of WeWork takes place through subsidiaries, each of which is specifically founded, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.
Russia again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of 262 poachers who had fished illegally in the waters had been arrested, according to the Russian internal intelligence service FSB reported to the agency Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot at and three of them injured. This time there had been no casualties, they said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were thus on their way to Russian territorial waters. According to their own information, the coast guard of Russia is patrolling their marine biological resources. During the re-checks, 30,000 squids were discovered. Furthermore, three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and brought to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the Ria Novosti agency, the coast guard detected more than 8,000 violations in 2018.
According to the media, thousands of North Korean fishermen have already been arrested there for some time in 2019.
Georgi Martynov, head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, recently also complained of high ecological damage by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow-meshed synthetic nets that were banned in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed. Even the ships themselves would not comply with hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard had been injured during the arrests last week. According to the FSB, a wounded North Korean died later from his injuries. On that 17th September, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened fire.
USA impose entry ban against former President Castro
The U.S. has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, and the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs stated in a statement on Thursday with Castro’s involvement in “gross human rights violations.” As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he was in charge of a system in which thousands of Cubans were arbitrarily arrested and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, Fidel Castro, brother of the Revolutionary leader who died, is also complicit in human rights violations there through the support of President Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard for human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," tweeted American Foreign Secretary Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump had declared entry bans on Wednesday against members of the Venezuelan government and the military among others. In Venezuela, a fierce power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging for months. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro’s government to force him to his knees and to help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro’s closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress opponents of the government.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia are likely to start due to the time shift before the protests move across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
It is relatively unclear how much worldwide support will be on this Friday after the record participation of the previous week. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday more than four million people went on strike for the climate. This Friday we do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries during the strike week, she added.
Last Friday, especially in Germany, the crowd was very large. A good third of all worldwide demonstrators – around 1.4 million – had participated in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates from Fridays for Future. This time, according to a list of the movement, demonstrations are planned in at least 65 cities, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Juechen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland in Sylt, people want to take to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had set himself before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 in order to call on the politicians of her country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. This has led to the Fridays-for-Future movement within a short time. Students and students in particular participate in the climate protests, but increasingly scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against earth heating and the impending climate catastrophe. In particular, according to the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming must be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees in comparison to the pre-industrial period.
Thunberg had arrived in New York almost a month ago after a two-week transatlantic cruise with a high seas racing yacht. There she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday she gave an emotional speech to the UN, in which she spoke strongly to the heads of state and government of the earth in her conscience. In her home Stockholm she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow, according to the Tass agency. The ban is to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes nevertheless must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should ignite a fire, then the penalty is higher. According to the Ministry, burning candles are also covered by the ban. Also grilling meat skewers on the balcony is no longer permitted.
Hit Cybercriminals - Investigators Raise Servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time removed a large server provider for illegal business on the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of hosting numerous websites, through which international criminals operate, as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach an der Mosel.
This was reported by the Attorney General’s Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening during a major action. Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Clients of the suspects are said to have been the operators of the world's second largest darknet marketplace for drugs, "Wall Street Market", which investigators smashed in the spring. According to the Attorney General's Office, the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled via a server in the cyber bunker.
Such a hoster had been removed for the first time in Germany, they said. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there had been searches in Germany and in neighbouring countries. It had been the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
Protests are planned in at least 65 cities in Germany, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia and Westerland in Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests Who are Thunberg's backmen?
A sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm up the climate. All the more astonishing is that a 16-year-old girl of all people keeps the mirror in front of the power man of this time. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical mastery or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and makes young people rise up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically speaking, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win a crowd of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to work for a fairer world. At that time, he was able to win a crowd of young people for himself and persuade them to cross the sea in order to enter the promised country, similar to how Greta Thunberg recently set out for America with a sailboat.
But is there a shadow side to this? Why does a share called "We don't have time" need to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold far-reachingly, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Old-established followers of Greta Thunberg were also a little indignant about the last PR show, respectively the trip by boat was probably too big on some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into effect in the media worldwide very well and a lot of money flows thanks to the impressive action.
This is where the spirits are divided: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work with stockbrokers during the World Rescue Action? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is more and more important in a democratic society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to critically question seemingly pious plans by certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet is crossing our solar system right now.
Astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed: a foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star is crossing our solar system at the moment. It was named after its discoverer 2I/Borisov and employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov in Crimea. He looked to the sky with a self-built telescope and further follow-up confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet, which does not originate from our solar system. He is only the second of his kind, which was sighted during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to get close insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the Comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar in origin and currently moves on a so-called hyperbolic orbit that leads it out of our system.
Comet was sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before the time comes, astronomers can observe it in detail. Unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in its approach, which means that it can be examined from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Agency Nasa. "After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about Comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form by similar processes as in our colleague Javier Licandro, who added de León.
The observation, however, goes beyond individual findings. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again asteroids occupy the researchers. Only recently a giant asteroid raced past the earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson horrified at brother
First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister scourges the prime minister's warlike language with clear words as "tasteless." It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Fraud", Treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to upgrade - at least verbally. During Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this met with massive indignation from the opposition, and in the meantime other critics have spoken out: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother was using words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be "hanged, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered." She considers this to be extremely reprehensible. She does not recognize the version of her brother, said Rachel Johnsons, who had taken part in the elections to the EU Parliament for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK".
In particular, she came up against the fact that her brother Jo Cox, an EU-friendly member of the House of Commons who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 referendum, was the best way to honor her memory by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson said in the House of Commons. "It is very tasteless to refer to a Member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," Johnson's sister criticized. The perpetrator obviously came from the extreme right-wing camp, which feels "emphasized by this kind of language."
Cox's widower also criticized the Prime Minister sharply. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used like this," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to stand up passionately and decisively for what you believe in, no matter what you think, but never "demonize the other side." He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen in which attacks had become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson’s younger brother Jo resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory’s deputy. “I have been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest in recent months – it’s an indissoluble tension,” Jo Johnson explained.
Johnson's language also met with sharp criticism in the Church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "is not worthy of this country." In a joint statement they stated: "In recent days, the language, both in debates and outside parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL is setting a strong signal: In the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-term show at the upcoming final of the US football league NFL. The organizers announced this on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the US," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American football league, which will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2nd in Miami. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl is putting two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. It promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed great hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and will be shown in German cinemas from November on in the drama "Hustlers".
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is eagerly awaited in the USA every time. This year, many people also regard the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump’s immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sports event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. Generally, over 100 million viewers watch the NFL final, and it is now extremely popular in Germany.
Last year there were political controversies ahead of us. The reason was the dispute over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to rise up in protest against police violence against blacks when playing the national anthem and had been dealt with hard by US President Donald Trump among others. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a super bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the rock group Maroon 5 appeared was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber joins Egypt's ruler: Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad for the time being.
The two men who influence the flow of blood on the streets of Egypt have both spent the past week abroad. One of them floated back to Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who dropped Muslim brother Mohammed Morsi, the country’s first freely elected head of state in 2013, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi’s action against political Islam and had not lost any syllable about the human rights violations on the Nile – in a week when Egypt’s security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the president. He had “no reason to worry,” said Sisi at the airport in the microphones of state television. “The Egyptians are not being misled.”
In the opinion of the president, the other man, who is currently determining what is happening on the streets, tries to mislead him. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he is deprived of the access of the security forces who would arrest him immediately if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the country’s cafés, living rooms and tearooms: with his YouTube channel “Mohamed’s Mysteries”, Ali calls his compatriots to rise up against Sisi.
He approaches the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president indulges in luxury and lets himself build magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leader on whom Sisi bases his rule accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with exactly these gentlemen for 15 years in his second job as a construction contractor, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding click numbers show.
After thousands of people had demonstrated against his rule for the first time in the past week since Sisi's grip on power, and almost 2,000 citizens, including prominent figures from civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "million-dollar march" for this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would dare to walk the streets. However, there were isolated smaller protests, for example in Giza near Cairo and in the village of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests, whose participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos were not independently verified at first. Security circles said that the police had stopped the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators tore banners with the president's portrait to pieces last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the outposts. In Cairo, several metro stations in the city centre were closed for "maintenance work", most of the streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011, were blocked. And on Rabaa Square, where supporters of the overthrown Muslim brother Morsi were entrenched in 2013, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent discontent from gathering: Sisi's Future Party wanted to hold a grand rally for the president.
Mohamed Ali prompted these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal doesn't have to be Tahrir Square," Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not clash with police officers." But as a backlash, this is not to be understood: "All Egypt is Tahrir Square."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different test possibilities.
Those who conclude an Internet contract need not blindly trust the speed specifications of the providers. Customers can check themselves how much of it is actually achieved in case of anomalies.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the consumer centre Bavaria.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests carried out by the providers are carried out according to vendor-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively", says the consumer centre Bavaria on their side to consider.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days to produce the promised service. This is best done by posting in writing.
If this does not affect even after multiple requests, customers can terminate and under certain circumstances also claim damages. However, in the event of failure to succeed, only the legal procedure helps.
First high-ranking Republican for investigation
As the first high-ranking Republican, the Governor of Vermont has called for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are being established," Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken - an impeachment procedure can lead to the presidential resignation.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been watching Biden for years.
Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump over the whistleblower affair; few have shown discomfort about it. Scott’s statements are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump’s policies on several occasions, for example, the easing of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man stays in the MCU: Another Marvel movie planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how the films around Tom Holland should continue.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This is reported by several US media in agreement. According to this, the cinema launch is already scheduled: The film will start in the USA from 16 July 2021.
Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted in "Screenrant" magazine as saying: "I am delighted that Spidey's path continues in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel Studios are delighted that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring".
But how does the sudden good news come about? Sony Marvel is said to have made an offer. According to industry magazines, Disney, to which Marvel also belongs, would participate with 30 percent in the revenue of Spider-Man films. However, the news is not confirmed.
This is how Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finale
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the big finale in the USA. In the last episode, there were many happy endings and as many cameo performances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, were paid tribute in a charming way. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers for the series finale.
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a final farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospects again showed the most memorable scenes with today’s Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she greeted him after his serving sentence.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned casually in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is walking towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a telling remark about his suit. Whether he actually threw himself over a skirt, the baffled Harvey wants to know about the groom, only to note snippily: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England".
Aegean Sea: Baby and four more children drown in boat crash
When a refugee boat capsized in the Aegean Sea one baby and four other children drowned. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard announced on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he wants to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wanted to "inform Turkey about the refugee situation," said Seehofer on Friday. Afterwards, he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to help cope with them.
On Friday, a spokesperson from the EU Commission confirmed Seehofer's planned trip with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
An unusually large number of migrants from Turkey continue to arrive in Greece. On Tuesday alone, 654 people were transferred to the Greek islands, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increase in numbers has led to doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who come to the Greek islands illegally via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to accept a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every deported Syrian.
However, due to lack of staff, the processing of asylum applications is only difficult on the Greek side. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos are suffering from almost 29 400 people. The worst situation is on Lesbos: 5200 Migrats are currently housed in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
There had never been so many since the EU-Turkey refugee pact came into force in March 2016, reports the state radio.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to physicians, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate change is "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system caused high temperatures and large temperature jumps within a short time and led to more heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics were affected.
Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photo breakdown
The leader of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Greens boss holds a reusable cup in her hand on a photo. But now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed yet. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw has never held Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, in her hand. On the party's website she was on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also distributed to the media - and there the cup was still a snooty (pap) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green boss has to answer for photo breakdown
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the Fake News party was producing in order to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection", and this in the middle of an election campaign for the House of Commons, in which Trudeau also has an increasing difficulty due to a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on the social media and started the discussion about fake news. A user shares a juxtaposition of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairpersons in order to hide their disposable cup".
May was shocked and confirmed on her blog that she didn’t know anything about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, talking to citizens, had a cup in her hand. However, she was right, she was made of bamboo. She always had it with her. A speaker of the party said that it was only about placing the party logo in the picture, and not covering up anything. Only a part of the photo can be seen on the website.
May writes that she feels sorry for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and at the same time asked herself something from her over-committed team: "If they want to work on a picture again, could they not do something to my face so that I look younger?"
Also the German Greens have come to Shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel - their pictures were not photoshopped. Thus the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice with plastic spoons on holiday, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Lifetime flight ban at Cathay
Supposedly Jaqueline Ng had been promised an upgrade by email from Cathay Pacific. But when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Get a spontaneous upgrade for Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the employees at check-in offer a change from Economy Class for free.
This case shows, however, how one should not do it: A self-declared influencer has asked the airline Cathay Pacific actively for a free upgrade. On Instagram follow Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users. On 30 May she flew from Taiwan to New York and on 7 June back.
On the way out, the employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, even though she showed an e-mail in which her Cathay Pacific allegedly planned an upgrade. The letter is said to have received the influencer from an airline marketing employee, while the airline accuses Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
On the return flight Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman showed the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at the airport JFK were skeptical: They checked at the headquarters. And in fact the employee, from whom the mail allegedly originates, denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system, in which the messages did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a life-long flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (around 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new flight tack to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests. Cathay had refunded her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed back the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. Furthermore, the terms and conditions of the airline state that it does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with it - and now calls on a lawyer.
Oil prices fall after report of ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday midday in a very short time. Most recently, a barrel (159 liters) of the Brent North Sea variety cost 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a West Texas Intermediate (WTI) barrel fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
A Wall Street Journal report on a cease-fire in Yemen was the trigger for the price slide. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia brought five percent of the world’s oil production to a halt. The Houthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had claimed the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would defuse the political tension in the region.
If an agreement were to be reached, one could focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Commodity Strategy Division at Saxo Bank of Bloomberg.
Oil prices thus continue its downward movement of the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent nearly 65 dollars.
Bloomberg recently reported that after the attack in mid-September, repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia was progressing faster than expected, according to which the production volume had again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original quantity.
Most recently, there have been several press releases citing insiders who report on the rapid progress made by Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, in the repair work. However, raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the establishment by Iran and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port. The crew is now preparing the departure, while the ship is still anchored, shipping manager Erik Hånell informed the Swedish radio on Friday morning in a text message.
However, the US announced that it would move defense missiles and soldiers to the Iranian archenemy in Saudi Arabia. Fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the US and Great Britain had at times significantly increased oil prices in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump are intensifying
In the affair over possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, accusations of cover-up against the White House have been raised. Several leading government officials have worked hard to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a controversial telephone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. An anonymous whistleblower explained this. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "cover-up". Trump spoke of a "witch hunt".
North Korea deems Trump and Kim's third summit questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that a third summit of leaders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon be held in the nuclear dispute. Kim Kye-gwan, a senior diplomat, said on Friday according to the agency KCNA, questioned the meaning and prospects of such a meeting because of a lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first summit in Singapore.
The U.S. had not done anything to implement the summit's resolutions the previous year, said the advisor to the North Korean State Department. He also criticised intensified US sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the U.S. and South Korea. However, he hoped for Trump's "wise" and "brainful" decision so that it could come back to a rapprochement.
Trump had said on Monday that he only wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he could explain himself. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the discussions, but so far without much success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers should help with demining
In Angola, the British Prince Harry symbolically ignited and destroyed an explosive mine. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the site of Dirico, he set up the ignition circuit. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded. Looking at the goal of getting Angola free of mines by 2025, he later demanded in front of running TV cameras: "I call on all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but who have not helped to commit themselves to help."
Pound under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British Pound under Pressure
In the face of an early reduction in interest rates, the pound loses value against the euro.
Frankfurt Speculations on the Bank of England’s (BoE) early interest rate cuts are adding sterling to the pound. The British currency was priced at 1.2269 dollars by up to 0.4 percent on Friday.
The sales were triggered by statements by central banker Michael Saunders. He brought forward a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as uncertainty would affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, since Saunders is considered to advocate a restrictive monetary policy, analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the brokerage company ActivTrades said.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens on the economy of the Brexit-Hickhack without directly signaling a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU without a divorce agreement on 31 October, if necessary.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations proved
Materials from the Moscow analysis laboratory are being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Antidoping Agency (Vada) and today's head of integrity of the World Athletics Association.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details of the doping scandal in Russia come to light - and they destroy the little credibility that the Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and only slightly. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the requested samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Vada).
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport had been revealed, followed by the closure of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After an individual examination, the International Olympic Committee launched around 270 athletes of the country under neutral flag at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, while 168 Russian athletes were at the Winter Games in February 2018. They were also allowed to participate in the World Cups in the various sports, and in the summer, the World Cup with the host took place in Russia.
Positive findings are missing
The following September, the Wada picked up the Rusada ban, but asked for access to the laboratory and the above-mentioned samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases during state doping. They should help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analytical laboratory has been manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check if the task force has received the correct data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" on Friday. "We have noted numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada received from a whistleblower and those that it received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings were missing, which were mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup Not Affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association is the only organisation to hold on to Russia’s ban. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already placed manipulations in the room and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the re-blocking of the Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
