Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, totaling 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought after the first preliminary results the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of the previous chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the tip.
In contrast, the election leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthian Governor Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse was the ÖVP, which lost almost nine percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in post-war Austrian history, and especially of the People's Party, which demanded the early elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead over the SPÖ.
The voters, however, probably punished the party for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, a renewal of the grand coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) received 18 percent of the votes for the time being, the BZÖ eleven percent - the social democrats expressed their fear that 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party had reached agreement with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) on a common government, which had even caused sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with each party, obviously relies on this development and assumes that he will return to Vienna in Austria's federal policy.
The Green Party also moved into parliament, but suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four percent hurdle and therefore did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If we fail to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who have been accused in India of collecting beetles illegally, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that there could be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister in New York emphasized this after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this doesn't clear up, then surely, then there will be a certain cooling down," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
After the talks, Mukherdshi said that it was difficult for the executive to intervene in judicial matters.
Despite all this, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charges and received a fine, the central government wanted the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter fell.
"His problem could be resolved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshi believes it would be best if he appealed to a higher court.
He could thus ask for release on bail and wait in freedom for his judgment, according to the minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had made the same statement during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then he would be eligible for a pardon," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to give the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such aid was already being offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, before his partner, he reaffirmed the Czech Republic's great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister gave an answer to the question whether he had received an undertaking from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"A lot has already been promised to me," he merely stated.
A Czech judges the struggle around the bottom of the sea
It approaches an electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he does not care about the continent, but rather a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is a member of the thirty-member staff of the UN's Division for Oceans and the Rights of the Sea.
His chief, Division Director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it.
This is where work elan and enthusiasm prevail.
So far, the seabed has a little-known world rich in natural springs.
Here you can find oil, further ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer, for example.
A seabed larger than the mainland
Today, the neighbouring states vehemently declared their claim to the new maritime areas.
According to a UN convention, they are exercising their rights to which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the territory of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometres from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplifiedly, as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its soles is considered to be a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the shore sea, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the relevant country to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many costly investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the latter three countries have succeeded," Mikulka adds.
The success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly increase its maritime areas, has recently met with an international response.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extent of the seabed, which was approved by the Commission last week, amounts to about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigation.
The benefits that will flow from the use of the seabed in the future will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is called by the convention as "common heritage of humanity".
In this case, no state has a special position.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not a gold mining land," says director Mikulka, exaggeratingly, adding that "the individual areas of the sea are clearly defined by law and the system is contractually anchored."
Czechs in the Pacific
Today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, the convention, like the investors of a few other countries, gave them the status of a so-called "breaking investor".
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawai and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"You can support there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan said.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the legendary Shem, who, according to legend, brought the golem to life.
German special forces were on site during hostage release
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it got serious, the special forces were ready, but they didn't come in.
More and more details about the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are becoming known.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, both specialists from the Bundeswehr and civil servants from GSG 9, the air force squadron of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts from the Technical Relief Agency were at the site of liberation.
However, the German forces were not needed because the hostage-takers let their prisoners go and fled when they saw signs of a violent liberation, according to ministers on Monday evening.
The Egyptian government had accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as a support force on the ground.
"Fortunately, this has not happened," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers had kidnapped the group of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman and their eight Egyptian companions in the south of Egypt on September 19.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages had been dragged back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers remained unclear until the end, as did the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages were in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on details of the release.
In Berlin, there was initially no information when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Luftwaffe and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has just failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went deep.
With 206 to 227 votes, the US House of Representatives has rejected the government's bailout package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by US President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority in favour of the program to contain the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on MEPs to vote, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones broke in by more than six percent or 600 points.
Investors were worried that the government bailout could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the failure became known, he fell again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence on the international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required for the programme to enter into force.
Organisers record increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
According to a study, sales for travel bookings for the coming months increased significantly compared to the previous year - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, the Germans’ desire to travel remains undistorted, according to a study.
When booking for the winter season, the rice offices recorded a sales increase of 31 percent compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced in Berlin on Monday.
According to the study of the market research institute GfK, accounting figures for the autumn months have already increased.
The DRV reported that the sales growth of travel agencies for October was around eleven percent compared to 2007.
These results are based on figures from the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and extrapolates it for the total market.
This includes the travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, trips to the USA in particular are in demand, the DRV reported.
Here, the increase in the booking amounted to about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the German regions, were particularly popular destinations.
Package travel in particular would be high on course, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising costs for energy and food, the costs here "are better calculable for the customer than during an individually organized holiday".
Consumers could save money through early bird discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple said.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that there will be again an increase in sales compared to the previous year - although according to a further study the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from liter jugs and celebrities in designer dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is blonde, TV presenter and wears a custom dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: Hardly three minutes on the meadow, already the photographers jump on us and snap the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first visit to the meadow.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the Weißwurstäquator, the feeling of well-being in the costume was still limited until now.
But once arrived at the Theresienwiese, everything is not as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only reap my dirndl apron.
A Munich woman draws my attention to the fact that I had tied the apron incorrectly: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, right forgiven, back widowed."
Secretly, I'm rubbing the loop from the back to the left.
"Suit," said it, laughing.
Others make less effort to use subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats, on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretch the naked backside towards you uninvited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is named Bob, comes from England and attends the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-drawn "ooooo".
That's what he tells me after he gets rid of his previously drunk measurements.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everybody thinks he's a trash can.
So Bob's one of those infamous wildbies.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics run in droves across the festival square, who have to take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at a time drag a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
This works like with most Wiesn visitors: Empty out, full back.
You can't see who's under the tarp in the promille coffin.
"These are the ones that goarnimmer pack," one of the paramedics called to me on request and disappeared in the commotion.
Name of victim announced by police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, who lives on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of reckless driving.
Meanwhile, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey wanted to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrating deep into the hinterland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guides tell you.
The building sits at the end of the platforms with a tower at each corner of the front and thus looks like any provincial German City Hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building falls apart about
But once you are inside the curved ticket counter, there is no doubt about the grandeur of the project whose westernmost access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late-commissioner in the imperialist game, had before implementing its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and further beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist plans were lame during the First World War.
His railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable borders of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt and urged the Turks and their Germans allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artful roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly disintegrated, largely overlooked by history.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and everything to the east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from neighbouring regions, created by the Cold War borders, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key figures of this new foreign policy, I have climbed the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the ACP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is regarded as a new city, for the new secular state project, to turn my back on the Ottoman past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity.
This has caused a lot of mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the main office of the AKP, a specially made, ultramodern stone and steel structure, in a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-finished shopping centers and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first shops of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The goal of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today it has to look both east and west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But surely, at some point," I asked, "Turkey could be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to face up to this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to almost routinely said: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, in a figurative sense, Europe as a whole can travel on the same railway tracks east towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German lords, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, lie in Turkey's hands.
And when I was waiting at the dock for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At that time, at least, there did not seem to be much doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Death" Handley (Obituary on September 11th) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was intended for young people up to 21 years, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979 some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological change of forms) stood for the choir's willingness and ability to tackle any piece of music presented to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and consisted solely thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that had never left for years.
How many times did Death tell us to "let the music speak for itself".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never bossy but never exuberant.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, during which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
For the past 40 years or so, I've written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed by one - often I've been inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He abhorred conductors who, according to his words, simply "peddling with one or two known show horses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (25 September) you write that "he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman Research Fellowship in 1950 ... while at the same time studying for a BSc, an MA and a doctorate.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it's not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for good and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life', because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me aware of them because of their simplicity and the power they radiate, as they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments.'
Second round of outstanding sales at Honda.
In November, Honda starts marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this large-scale saloon offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are the technical subtleties that make driving even more convenient and save gasoline.
Changes before the coming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made in this grand limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics will be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before you begin to analyze the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation has appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter time.
Although Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of 2002 and also in the course of 2008.
After jazz had appeared on the market, around one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 models from Jazz in 2007, the expected estimates are 10 000 cars, which is 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of the total Honda sales in Spain.
As far as the new generation of the model is concerned, the head of the branch in Spain expects to be able to sell 2 000 jazz models per year.
More specifically, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover up the sales cut in Spain.
In reality, the brand leaders hope to complete the year with total sales of 22,000 models, which is 4,000 less cars than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1,8 % compared to the previous year (1.6 %).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
This is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters, the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese producer's market estimates, 50 % of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remainder is distributed across the Old Continent and Japan.
The launch of Insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, this leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due on the one hand to the new space flexibility program and on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous model of Jazz.
Also the capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading area, reaches up to 339 liters, i.e. 19 liters larger than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2 litre gasoline engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, besides the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, an improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of gasoline engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first version with 1.2 liters achieves the output of 90 HP at 6 000 rotations with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This gasoline engine - the predecessor of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
`Car bee' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, this time Nissan was inspired by nature, to be more precise, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight is due to the swarm behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the technical development center of the Nissan Motor Co. developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan security shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped flight room, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the facet eyes of the bee, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows it to fly undisturbed in its personal airspace without interruption.
To reproduce the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an in-vehicle microprocessor, which is immediately translated into signal for avoiding collision
`At the moment when obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this evasive maneuver is absolutely instinctive.
If it were not so, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the senior engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot can neither deviate upwards nor downwards, but also not out of square; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in infinite ways that bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
`This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require neither the information nor the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres made, therefore it can work continuously with only a few dozens of KB of memory.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even the MBs of the disk space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan predicts will introduce in the next ten years in series production cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite, in order to lead when driving to the destination and avoid the obstacles on the way.
She's shaking before she gets charged with a mortgage.
It must be recognised that the US Treasury, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and in order to prevent US citizens from getting involved in mortgage stories of the supposedly cashable banks, an entertaining and informative game for the Internet surfers was developed: 'Bad Credit Hotel', they say.
Or maybe the 'hotel of bad loans' or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
She certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is more a page for the teenagers than a place for all viewers.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears at the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley makes her capital available for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, an innovation due to a strong fall in its stock market price.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG would buy 99% of Morgan Stanley common shares at a uniform price of $25.25, which would total $3 billion.
The price assumed is below 19% of the share price of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares that will secure a 10% profit and be resold at a price of 31,25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global deal will be made on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, which is 28% above the current market value.
However, the Morgan Stanley share fell by 6.79% to $23.07 against 17.00 GMT.
'This strategic link is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank,' said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley accepted this status last week, which will allow him to expand their business into new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street's biggest names to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last few days: Last Monday Morgan had simply stated that she would sell up to 20% of her shares for about $8.5 billion to Japan.
'A week ago,' said Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, in Tokyo, 'we thought that the interest would consist entirely of common shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay for its Morgan Stanley shares 7% below their price.
And the business will go with a decrease in profit of about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preference shares into ordinary shares in one year if the latter are exchanged at more than 50% above the selling value within a given period, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will allow him to use investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a group spokesman refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to record a solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan stated that he 'clearly' lowered his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group to watch their stock market price fall by half, while the price of insurance against insolvency has skyrocketed.
This price declined on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivors' of Wall Street's major investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that they had withdrawn $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Refounding the Republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorial Rafael Correa.
It was that third person who, following the example of his like-minded and friends, put the plan of a new constitution for election this Sunday.
Mission accomplished, because according to the public results, which amounted to 80% of the vote, 64% voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of the ballot papers were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order for the constitutional project to be adopted, more than half of the votes cast must be cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations and a census of a non-governmental organisation announced a clear victory for 'yes', and 63% to 70% predicted it.
By the way, on the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly', he had assured Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorialians.
Of course Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence according to the observational delegation of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text consisting of 444 points in order to secure the 'new socialism' for which the President is committed.
The constitutional project transfers the power of the state to the economy by giving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives largely on oil production by foreign companies and on the foreign exchange that emigrates send into the country.
The project, advanced by the 2006 elected Correa, also admits greater power to the head of state, who will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
In the end, it also provides for the ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Equatorian base as a base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the attack on the hijackers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were detained in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon in a healthy and unharmed manner.
In the morning they had been liberated by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military base of al-Maza right next to Cairo International Airport at around 3:30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, aboard a helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, a foreigner's district of Cairo, to be examined there.
They all enjoy 'best health' and the kidnappers 'no ransom was paid', said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna on the runway.
After being taken prisoner on September 19 at an off-road vehicle safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown hijackers.
They are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two guides, four chauffeurs, one border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special forces, from aboard two helicopters, launched the attack at night shortly before dawn.
'On both sides, shots were fired and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,' said this person in charge, who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian Special Forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is now, about the role that secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces have played.
'We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men from the intelligence service and special forces,' he explained without further detail.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the night, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a patrol of an off-road vehicle, where the hijackers were, of which they killed six, including the leader from Chad, and two arrests.
The army stated that they were associated with a rebel group from Darfur, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), but immediately denied this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is the central theme of the current election campaign.
That's all the better.
But an area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the pitiful sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that starve miserably?
Which politician will dare to remind the Federal Government that it neglects its monuments and culturally important buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no proper laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is making EUR 3.5 million available solely for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbours have written in their country's constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, by all deputies and by all governments, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the association of Quebec’s historical societies, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 historical societies are working hard on history, on saving the numerous private archives, and on preserving the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, protesting with the power of despair when promoters and decision makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux states want to help the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which is in turmoil as a result of the US financial crisis: the three states make a total of EUR 11.2 billion available to the bank and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands discussed this weekend at the highest level, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner for the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions that are now being taken in connection with the bank could be of a precedent.
In line with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy approximately 49 percent of the bank’s shares.
The bank will probably sell part of its shareholdings, especially the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis started a steep descent last week, and serious crisis scenarios were already emerging in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too large for a failure.
The Institute's securities fell 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
Given the current share prices, the market value of the group amounts to EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to management.
According to management, the $700 billion US rescue package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets are responsible for the decline in Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new Director General of the Bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find itself interested with an objective offer.
The Belgian government, however, tried to calm down - no investor should tremble for his money, they said.
No panic has erupted among the customers, the bank's branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fox in the chicken coop
Due to a person's drug use, life and health insurance companies in America often refuse to enter into a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of the drug data to the consent of the data subject in any case.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we entrust the fox to the chickens" - quoted the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance sets the fees and payment amounts in case of damage depending on the health status of the customer, and if the risk is overestimated, the insurance is not taken out at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was concluded only in knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: Based on the customer's identification number, he obtains the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, i.e., which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from which disease the customer suffers and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it would be possible to conclude that his blood fat levels are untreatable, which would automatically rank him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so the insurance companies only have to do the paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the drawbacks is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as migraines and hot flashes, but also depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the point of view of insurers, while the previously mentioned is not.
For the consultation and processing of the data, separate societies have formed which, before they receive the data, ask the patient for his consent.
Meanwhile, they have to do this by law, although omissions have not yet been punished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and combine them with data on drug use, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data and control of their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect extends only to service providers in the health sector and insurance companies.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned can hardly prevent access to his data, since otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are somehow left to the mercy of the fox.
Global menu from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this was the main issue, among other global problems, at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indian summit is also being held, which mainly discusses cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic superpower that should be given more voice and voice in international concerns, member states have not yet been able to agree whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not even discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to a good 100 billion euros.
In view of the fact that the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this target is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into one agreement, so that in future air transport will also be boosted.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is the number one partner in India, New Delhi is only ninth among the EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
Among them was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and the convening of a UN conference was also urgied.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides to blame for the failure.
The EU stressed that it is sticking to its energy and climate programme, which means that pollutant emissions should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed to this, as did the proposal to conclude a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian head of government is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it is hoped that orders will be placed to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the Agency, the agreement is to be concluded for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will spread over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honor of the event.
The Under-Secretary for the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 sqm exhibition space "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room Structure in the Exhibition Hall 5.0 of the Book Fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives relating to the publishing industry in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers decreases throughout the whole, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
The billionaire Steve Fossett's small plane disappeared a year ago
The small aircraft by Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007 was found.
The parts have been found on a 3000 m high plateau, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the aircraft.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely dispelled the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located to which a troop has been sent. Now we have the certainty that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or near it.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Road Safety Agency (Ntsb) noted that just hours after the aircraft was sighted, a crew was sent out to identify the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett took off in Yerington, Nevada for a 3-hour flight.
Yesterday, some of Fossett's personal belongings were finally found in California, not far from the Nevada border, by a couple near their home on Mammoth Lakes.
These are two passports with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history through a long succession of records.
In 2002, he succeeded in the sixth attempt, as the first human being to orbit the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without a stopover by plane.
Among his many records is also an altitude flight of 15445 m over the Andes, this one however with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you don't expect
A suvice that falls out of the traditional schemes thanks to its original design and special lines, the spreading surface and its clear angles.
With this off-roader, Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new life into the sector.
Due to its exceptional characteristics, the Suv Glk will also be presented in an unconventional manner, which will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
Thus, the advertising drum that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the automotive sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, which will be carried out in different chamois, which will occupy the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, by 15 November.
The first case will consist of the presentation of the car in form, whereby 3D glasses, which are distributed near the Corso Como, are intended to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear so seemingly out of the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in different moments in all its details, in order to sit back together as a whole.
Undoubtedly, it is Mercedes' concern with this advertisement to introduce a new kind of autoreklame into this rather stereotyped field.
But will it be able to attract the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom all of Italy is ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following the Italian national team for years and which, to be honest, did not cause any serious problems until recently.
Never before have there been clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right milieu.
The conveyors come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Puglia joined them in Sofia.
They wear the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: but these were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a clash with a truly radical right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
The Figc provided 144 cards to Italian fans for the game: all were issued in names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among those who travelled to Sofia, there was no one with an ongoing stadium ban trial.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already pre-loaded in this respect, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi during the riots can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans won't put a foot in a stadium anymore.
Thank God.
But now, of course, there is fear of copycats who could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be discharged immediately, and that does not in any case give such behaviour the opportunity to justify it", it says from the Viminal.
Therefore, "eyes on especially with regard to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
Indeed, there is a small core of the Italian Ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (sports supervision) gathers, on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services, which deals with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce Rufe and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed without joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Frenchsco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Prior to that, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, now comes from.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but without a doubt the behaviour of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist – adds the No. 1 of Osservatorio – crimes are being punished in the country of their deed.
So far, this group had kept in check, but now it needs to be reconsidered what has happened and will happen.
But let's also talk about the whistles during the anthem Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but allow me, because there is no education...".
