Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
It's a crazy place where young people are supposed to meet today.
A tomb chapel, where now is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners cultivate the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich reveals exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
Anyone who had to get upset before, because the Auto-Navi displayed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital atlas of Bavaria, an offer of the geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but precisely because of that very instructive.
Especially when you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the distribution area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital atlas of Bavaria is a patchwork carpet that is not immediately recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called Urpositionsblätter, were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian survey administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical photograph of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive map of Bavaria.
Elector Max IV Joseph pushed the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison earlier/today is the most impressive example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a Munich district 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named only in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered hallways from the so-called "original image", from which the property tax was derived.
Today, small plots no longer occupy farmers there - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sonne".
A large green area is visible north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the venue of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt one reads in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here at Auerfeldstraße, people with delusions were once locked up.
There the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was founded in 1858/59.
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of the so-called madmen.
He also prohibited the staff from using violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked with the institution for an exhibition.
For 280 patients there had been space at first, later was extended to 500 places.
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost has been located there, one of the largest psychiatry in Germany.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people are now meeting in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
To the west is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - architecturally inspired by the original building of the madhouse, which had been destroyed in bombings during the Second World War.
Marienplatz was listed as the "Haupt Platz" in 1856, and Kaufingerstraße was called the "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs tore many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A large one remained until today - at Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business buildings and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn main line took place.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled up.
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored People issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to travel through the state and to exercise extreme caution, as a number of questionable racial-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," the Group comments.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as state law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have violations of the civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped for their skin color, they are beaten up or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints at such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first such warning that the organization issued for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline while traveling the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also refers to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's office showing that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be willing to bring bail money or let relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which ranked the state 16th in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidezaunprojekt is elementary
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue next year.
CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got a picture on the spot.
Representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, where he farmed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplied 40 dairy cows and just as many young animals, and housed holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Schwarzwaldmilch" is for him the alternativeless marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he called the fence project "elementary important".
I cannot operate profitably on such steep areas.
The grassland area provides a lot of work, much has to be processed with the motor Sense.
"We are struggling with conditions and topography here," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run an organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the Leader funding".
Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be extended for quite a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they can move their business forward," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticised for their support
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in via the fence support.
The open area thus amounts to 40 hectares, which must not be afforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71,500 euros, half was supported by Leader, one quarter by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of fence.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible".
Peter Weiß was also convinced that "best food is produced here".
The Baden-Wuerttemberg Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) allows the state to support pasture fences.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the presence of a funding framework designated by the LPR.
In addition, the fenced area must not be manageable (hanging inclination over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018, the application is currently being submitted by eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build just under 16 kilometres of fence.
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans value this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he had.
But he attacked its meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller scolded Acosta, "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller's factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It's about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your distressed masses longing to breathe freely, / the miserable apostasy of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "elderly waste" could be seen better on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's US.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who fought to place their words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American Republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativity.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it back a long time ago.
The great cryneck Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for Trump's coming, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the nightly world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is said to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not light the way to the United States."
Quite unusual, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it's about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever like to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to light the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
Neil Black, Executive Director of Athletics in the United Kingdom, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship squad "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which will start on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that UK athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue until we find out," Black said.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m course, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Your captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, left the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great."
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will compete in the 400 m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes to date at the World Championship was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle distance runner Muir leads this way and last year set five British and two European records.
She will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m races.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scotsman in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says that she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only be part of the team, but in some cases also participate in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And here they are as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.
As far as my speech as a captain is concerned?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it's really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't apply for public office if you can't stand heating up voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scolded at the criticism, sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said, "Free speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led to slaughter like sheep."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for this earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Well, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his voters and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum officially called and employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD, was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment section of the news program "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, then some people tend to disregard it as a so-called collective commitment and not accept it as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's staff described as a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "promotion."
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if the same thing had been done that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers beat his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't shut her up.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse belong to the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, which led next door in the Archerfield left to the final round before losing to Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance Club built, and we'll see how it reaches its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course at its best, it is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job fixing this place.
He is an avid supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"That really feels special," said the Southport-based player.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on home ground.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad about how it went."
With the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scotsmen on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, the parking costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.
All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Fewer lung cancer deaths from passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he used his own study on the subject of 1994.
At that time there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections turn out to be very complex
The construction works on Villinger Straße are in full swing and "are somewhat in time", says the head of the building yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of the house connections the situation is more complicated than suspected, since much is hidden underground, which is not noted in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, is a big problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of motorists in front of red traffic lights and barriers is already enormous," says Heinze.
The road was closed and only the regular buses were allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days have been quite exhausting.
But fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
In fact, she rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai government in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and swallowed with zealous, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, e.g. washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5:00," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was admitted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote through a public hand-up before the occupying forces.
An existing movement for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is tedious. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour car ride with the rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated roofs, which have been transformed by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago of Papuan worshiped a god called Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's Indonesia's gold land, too.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has mined $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated USD 78 billion worth of wood resources.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 survey in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are mercilessly treated.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything" says a report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane in 2016, which contains reports of last year's atrocities, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric shocks are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to work in the provincial capital Jayapura.
"It has cost the native Papua - the Mama mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address the inequalities and violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifle butts, saying victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in a circle and imitating a bird song - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators started throwing stones at police and military posts.
When the atmosphere was warmed up, the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document from TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, the TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Chief Inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" her station because she was being attacked.
"We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the Papua Police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings came to Jakarta 'filtered' the following day.
Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura for three weeks in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it won't happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations, but there are processes that need to be gone through," he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, who was accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" that claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with fierce incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military looked for me," he says.
The shootings didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai's Deiyai neighborhood.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take a unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killing one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly admitted here, said TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and the police's mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the crop for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the indigenous Papuans and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and more prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the skills necessary to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the tribe council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international media reporting remain strained.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's election campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report on Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the group's allegations and said to journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and harassed him "We want freedom", according to a source who also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will have another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokovi is a person with good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shoots," says Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, regard their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he has to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai shot victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site directly opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never be given justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire took place on Friday in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre-high, 79-story building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high-rise building in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and people's screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident who gave his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that firefighting units extinguished the fire and cooled the building around 4:00 a.m. local time (0:00 GMT).
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of skyscrapers around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In Britain, the police said that they believe that the system of panels for insulation and covering at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Continue Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) failed at the General Assembly with his big Davis Cup coup.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the proposal revolutionary for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, which are often very long, but which are also very much appreciated for this reason, are thus retained in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member states voted for the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was barely missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions," Haggerty said.
They will continue to work to improve the contests.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place had not even come to the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: The finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will in future have the right to host in the first round in the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places etc. are facilitated and the players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers bring banned items to the aircraft, find out a survey
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent of those deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other objects with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered late that they had gone by mistake with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers are more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly to have carried objects with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought banned drugs onto the aircraft.
The company said it interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods through airport security and how many deliberately did it.
It is no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through safety were the ones most likely to fly.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure of which liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of them.
So it is no surprise that the largest quantity of objects seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA could see books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to indicate with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
So far, he has concealed the fact that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has for the first time revealed a different, less glamorous number when it announced the latest quarterly balance sheet: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
In recent months Musk had often advertised the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay back fully the 1000 euros (in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment".
Currently there are 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla CEO does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth targets lies not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all models taken together - it should be 500,000, in 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines, which have never been tested in practice before, without major interruptions with maximum capacity.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if major delays occur, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPO CEO Pruitt withdraws because of delaying the Obama Era’s emissions reduction rules
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smog-induced air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of public environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous post in a Federal Appeals Court.
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid "intruding into local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before being appointed by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly switched to blocking or delaying regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry oppose.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPO administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that its reversal of ozone standards simply enhances the EPO's willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Among previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be accused by groups of activists and others, and to set the deadline for implementation in an agreement," said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through legal proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that we have seriously."
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion stated that Pruitt will eventually use his "authority to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on sound policy and the best available information".
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPO this week, said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPO's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil-ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists cheered over Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for the protection of the air that we breathe in," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological crusade to appeal to polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the Sixth Benefit Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made Tumlingen's friends and supporters their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem".
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg charter book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Master Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 marks silver.
According to the document, apart from the former parish church, the Tumlinger Berg also had a stately courtyard, to which the church or the right of patronage belonged and not the other way around.
So people also lived there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "Berg" was the third, the noble settlement core of the village.
Old maps from the period around 1600 underpin these historical conditions.
The patronage right arose from the early medieval own church law.
A gentleman who built and furnished a church and occupied it with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
This involved the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The taller of the two disintegrated at Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later in World War II in 1942.
During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648) the windows were smashed and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was abandoned.
On New Year's night in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower gnome that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Pensioneren" as successor of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
The Friends and Sponsors of Tumlingen invite to the sixth serenade on Sunday, 16 July to the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle.
This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local head Hartmut Romann speaks the closing word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 p.m.
At the end of the serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest", the organisers put out the fantastic view.
The serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants approval of wind turbines to be checked
"Boisheim defends itself" sees no legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the district council.
The association "Boisheim defends itself" has asked District Administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind power plants in Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 in Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at that time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible within this concentration zone, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
Such zones are intended to prevent the "sparing" of the landscape.
A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette by changing the land use plan - but the district government had not approved it because of a formal error.
"Due to the lack of a prerequisite for planning law, the granted approval notice is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn", said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim defends itself".
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break the city council decided again the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit of the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This precludes the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines at this point in time".
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been received by Kreis Viersen since last week," said one speaker.
The circle shall give them the opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to lead to the proceedings being stopped.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the circle did not want to comment on the content of the argumentation of the association "Boisheim fehlt sich" on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area on Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the City of Viersen is indirectly involved, had already concluded leases with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity demand of all four-seater households.
NEW Re plans to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the go-ahead for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash together: woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10 o'clock on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The Landesstraße remained closed for hours.
According to the police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich drove her car with her 53-year-old mother as a companion to the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and dealers plan "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The Gewerbeverein and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the inhabitants to the shopping center.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend should raise customers' awareness of which offers the own city holds apart from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market, is therefore planned.
In addition, local companies are to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to invite to "midnight shopping".
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags, which point to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
The municipal administration and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
With this, the business association and the city are entering another stage of the project "Attractive Downtown".
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the Brunnenfest, including Sunday open for sale, discussions with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials are to be re-opened or re-opened.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city centre while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help revive the city center - up to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network, which had partly spread, King had said in spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities were participating for the first time in the country's third "home shopping day".
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities", says Streich.
The action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his or her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine more injured, some of them severely.
According to the fire department, a wounded person was in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
A man died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A missing person was later also found dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
The authorities suspected that the cause of the accident was work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on Mexico for payment of the border wall after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US President insulted him because he publicly denounced the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. refugees emigrating to Australia to take over was "ridiculous", "mis" and "dumb" and that the existence on the trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a "depee" after proposing a ban on the relocation of refugees to the U.S..
Mr. Trump ended the call after he told Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore’s Ford Massacre: Activists Reintroduce Racial Lynchact as a Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, rumbling toward the Ford bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped out to block its way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked testily through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"We want this n--r Roger!" the man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Crying tore the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene that was played on July 22nd is just a reenactment.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience uttered very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really incredible that not a single person has been arrested all these years - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," Tyrone Brooks said, helping to organize the reenactment.
"It's a dirt stain on a story, but it's a burden to our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman from the state of Georgia and a civil rights activist for life.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want the cessation, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A coroner lays a bedcloth over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching trial.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer primary.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farm tenant Roger Malcolm stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Hester had slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying wasn't from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid 600 dollars to free Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was escorted to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
"It was an electoral massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual rearrangement of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is vivid, poignant and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer present in America.
It's hard to watch and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching, because we will then be confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - crowded into a room and listened when Greene started a well-recorded overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director here.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role would never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm, who yells at Hester and pushes him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n--he, get out of my property!"
Rascona returns the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!"Rascona asked.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people then said 'n--he'."
"Yes," one of the other black actors joked.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And that's where the energy in space shifts, a sense of camaraderie replaces discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman dressed in a mourning dress stands above the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's grieving eulogy "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York to see the show, many just come down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia's oppressive humidity for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the bodies.
Children squat on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mutters as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynching rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then collapses crying in their arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience sits together with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chats excitedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about the feeling the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today it's just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone holds Brook's court at his table, eating and recalling civil rights.
He said he'd already started planning the performance next year.
"The reenactment is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like that if we don't learn anything from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are doomed to repeat it."
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also relies on a colourful and frivolous production in front of a gigantic six-story backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner including the remains of the wall and the Donerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from the GDR era or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes oldtimer parked in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through his "ring" production.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drags a body into the trunk in Hollywood manner and gives the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen, which surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who modestly bows his hands to the Merkel raute, are celebrated in a stormy way.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothing.
Frank Castorf and his directing team were eagerly awaited.
If he had had to make a whining whistle concert in 2013, there was a big cheer five years later in which the occasional "buh" call went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner may have been pleased about this.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in a way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but had also grown an understanding of his point of view.
I'm drawing a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their volunteer year.
Where?
quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture store, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at school all day.
What are your experiences with this?
quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years old now, so you're a late volunteer.
How come?
Menge: I graduated from high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully canceled.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I wondered what you were doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, you can see how it really is on site, in the focus maybe, too.
And was that so?
quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I'm going to start my social studies in the winter semester.
I'm going to study dual, I'm probably doing social worker training at the Herne Youth Office, and I'm going to study at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.
Isn't it a bit unusual to have several different locations during volunteering?
quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always depends on where you make your FSJ.
It can be done from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, this was just the right thing that irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike civil engineering studies?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of you, who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, or a youth who has been taken out of the family - you always have to go into it individually.
Very interesting.
And you weren't afraid of contact?
Menge: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring program would be launched to overcome the pressure facing the company.
The job cuts announced by General Director John Fallon for the most part at the end of 2018 and early 2019 will be in addition to his previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by an additional £300 million ($394 million) in a third cost reduction program to revive a business that was hit by the rapid step to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after achieving an increase of 1% to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Convoy attack by Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and one interpreter had been injured, Nato reported.
According to unconfirmed local reports, the incident in Qarabagh district also killed three civilians.
The bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
Nato's statement states that the explosion on Thursday evening occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "person-worn improvised explosive device".
The statement states that all injured persons are in stable condition and are treated in the US Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack since the US-led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump weighs up the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to delay Obama’s government regulation, requiring states to contain smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
Late on Wednesday, the EPO announced the decision to push forward the so-called "Ozonal Provisions 2015" and said it showed the Agency's obligation to cooperate with states.
"We believe in the dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," said EPO CEO Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the EPO to delay the ozone regulations - which are to be measured in a part of the country in order to determine where cuts need to be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the District of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday saying that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental constraints imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
However, efforts have triggered the setback of the Democrats and nature conservation groups concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPO website says that breathing in air that contains ozone "can reduce lung function and amplify respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Local Council wants common space
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to set up a common room in the future senior residence.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the still missing property part has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still be long before the area previously owned by the parish is in the municipality, there is now no planning obstacle to the project to be managed by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a common space.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with after all 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council plan to provide such a community space not just as a meeting place for the residents of senior-friendly housing, but also openly into the community.
As an example, the word from the "Strickcafé" made the rounds.
The decision made last autumn by the provision of funds for the current budget is made clear by the possibility of funding.
The building is located in the renovation area.
According to Tjaden, the establishment of a common space would be eligible at 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposal for a decision states that, in order to signal to the investor that he does not want to be thrown between his legs in this respect, it is necessary to establish that both the saddle - which is based on the environment - and the roof of the desk - which reduces the height of the platform and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.
Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer, is this addition.
If it helps, he'll pass the board unanimously.
It's not that easy with the common room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings of her own, with which one does not quite progress, but now one leans at the common room out of the window, she says: "I make myself difficult with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common area - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area one does not grant a grant, but instead gets a real equivalent, which can be marketable in case of doubt, is the counter-speech.
Staiger's request to split the decision accordingly is supported by three supporters.
So it remains with two votes against the original program, which Stefan Haller sums up in this way: "If we take the decision like this, we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: Radler is thrown on road
When crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was hit by a car on Wednesday in Garath and seriously injured.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on the road from Hilden on his bike at 12.20 p.m. on the bike path of the road Schwarzer Weg.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the level of the road at Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove on the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the oncoming traffic.
He bumped into a car that was driven by a 66-year-old Hilden woman.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rucksack.
FC Bayern München must give up David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to skip the game against Dortmund.
FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven pros are missing the defending champion in the Supercup against the Cup winner.
Before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 hrs/ZDF and Eurosport) the personnel concerns at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger at Cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti has to do without David Alaba in a duel with BVB.
The Italian confirmed this on Friday.
In addition, the Munich-based Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six test games, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team's game.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is team balance.
It wasn't good last time."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team is showing these qualities.
The crew is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game."
The duel of the two German football heavyweights captivates the fans.
The match is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Wandering from star to star in the Harz
The first "star path" is to be built in the Harz region.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "starry path" meets the information needs of many visitors to the Harz, they said.
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
The members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well accessible installations at five to six locations" in Oberharz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiss and Sieber would be eligible.
The information on the panels will be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility was also a criterion.
Later, the star path is to be extended by train.
"On the star path, viewers learn a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines stronger than another, even though it is much farther away.
It is also shown in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to see.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy can be seen with the naked eye.
Since 2003, there has been something similar to the planned Sternenwerg – the Planetenweg – in the university city on the initiative of the support association Planetarium Göttingen.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (community of equals) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun standing exactly 75 meters away measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixed star would still take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's super featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound for pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I am a former feather weight," Garcia recalled.
"I ascended for Broner [on 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he has to move to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year in order to arrange a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who is also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked for it," Garcia said and later expressed openly to fight in the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he might participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-fight champion from Riverside looks "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off".
Garcia said the focus was to show punch strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
"This is the battle that must be fought.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."
Four injured after tire burster
In an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people were injured.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira probably lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. just before the Marktbreit junction after a tyre burster.
The car hurled to the right into the embankment, where it overturned and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partially seriously injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was closed towards the north for about one hour, then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defensive formation will score points in Aue after the 2:2 season opener against Braunschweig.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, as well as with the result, if the two goals against Braunschweig had not been the opposite.
"There were two goals too many, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defensive player.
In the Erzgebirge, the chain of three is to be further optimized.
And the Fortuns don't want to catch a goal after a free kick.
"For the future, there will be no one standing next to Michael (Rensing) on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that even after his experience in preparation, his team can cope better with the chain of three than with the chain of four.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his business, "because we have players who can build well in the three-way chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," Hoffmann said.
"Requirement is, but that we harmonize even better and that we do not afford so many play errors in the construction."
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw doesn't know.
The performance could be quite okay," Hoffmann said.
"But if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the trophy, we will certainly be able to talk about a good start to the season."
His coach didn't want to know.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight match days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be stopped prematurely due to a storm.
"Now they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, because they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a favorite climber.
"But they don't know 100 percent where they are at the moment," says Fortuna's inner defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go as an easy favourite on Sunday to the encounter in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we sweep them away just because we have the claim to be among the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance sheet is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," explains Fortuna's chief coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish asylum age evaluation tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are older than 18 years, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started to carry out the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they are to make the assessment of age more precise after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics of recent months, the numbers are fairly constant," he said to The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "proposed that the person being examined be 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
To judge biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could," he told the Metro newspaper.
Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full on the Plan
The work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Roads and Transport at the Freiburg Government Bureau.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete arched bridge covered with red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it is now getting old.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three structures are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red coloured sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is an edge fixing that is also used as an operating route.
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
That's where the pedestrian path is supposed to run.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Special sensitivity has required the installation of pipes by the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by leaflets.
In addition, fish and crayfish had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the Sammelweiher in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a single lane traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge on the Lauterbacher village entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully closed.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
It is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest at German Potato Salad
It is not so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, Linke) belong to a broad alliance, which on this day peacefully shows flag, because the AfD invites in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the poster "big campaign start".
And well-known names are brought to the start - like Alice Weil, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24th, and the deputy federal chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD students, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colourful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
It's a colorful picture.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forum One World and one of the leading organizers, is really pleased: "Great how many people have gathered here".
There is music and plenty of food, including a "original German potato salad, which the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he had tried to organize such an event and got the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but received a cancellation there, because because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces available.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event on the Rondell forecourt, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing is that it remains peaceful".
This is also the case: around 8 p.m. on the Rondell forecourt a band provides entertainment, in the Stadthalle various speakers, among them the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Wedel, and Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is shortly after 21 o'clock to clean up.
The police can move away - no special incidents.
Trombone meets trumpet
A reunion with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli can be found in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the Klosterkirche.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Schwarzmeer trifft auf Schwarzwald", or even "Balkanfolklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo trombone player of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Thus Johann Sebastian Bach resounds with the two as if in a new garb, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by jazz echo prize winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play merge into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core piece of the program was premiered only this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," says Kristen Stewart quite openly about her bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what's next?'"
The best-known relationship of the Hollywood star was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually broke up bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it's never confused or obstructed me.
I just never liked not to be taken seriously."
According to "Bang Showbiz", she suffered especially from this when she was in school when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was 11, the kids told me I was gonna look like a boy.
I really felt attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and I think to myself, 'Girl, be proud of you!'."
Especially to the public, they don't like to explain their love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And perhaps some call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself to the whole public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change party
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia that I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in cheer.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday night, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying, "The change of Governor Justice's party is another blow to a Democratic Party that would stop us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorates and the control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive, unifying message," said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
The world leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be re-entered into sport.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics that his country's banishment from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were taken away from gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of government-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "joyed" about Russia accepting the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it has been a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We need to do everything we can to normalize this situation in the coming months.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Championships in Athletics, which will start in London on Friday, in accordance with the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free to work, he said reporters in London after a talk at the IAAF Council.
Mourning act for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a funeral in Fritzlar, North Hesse, about 1000 people of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali were thinking.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the unsolved cause of the crash.
However, she described the two killed pilots as "donors of her compartment".
"We bow down to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from Northern Hesse were killed on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a wake of the Bundeswehr to the Fritzlar Cathedral Sankt Peter.
At noon only the family in the church said good-bye.
Afterwards the funeral began in the family circle, close friends, from representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as politics.
Among them were Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The mourners laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm on the coffins.
In front of the church Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the dead soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced in the field.
The Chief of Staff had built up the flight operations of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also declared: "If this occupation could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able to".
Minister von der Leyen did not show any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the operation was dangerous.
But it is also of high importance "for a country from which we are separated by only two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were taken out of the cathedral.
When and where they were buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the royal family on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the announcement continued.
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title.
After the accession of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
He retired in 2016 and also holds the title "Prinzgemünd".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not regard himself as equal to his wife - not even after death, said Lene Balleby, the head of the Danish royal family.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's been working for for the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the French Embassy at the Thames.
During his later wife the expressions of sympathy of the people always flown, Prince Henrik had a difficult position with the Danes in his almost 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitted socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, whom I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals in this country, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
There were two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid new elections
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green government majority in favour of a rapid new election of the state parliament, but he does not want to resign.
We were in favour of the dissolution of Parliament on Friday.
Previously, the surprising resignation of a Green MEP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official date of the Landtag election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
Former Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained in Hanover on Friday.
CDU Group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his group include them.
Thus CDU and FDP together had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Grüne 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new parliament will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thumler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the Landtag resolves its self-dissolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its next steps on Tuesday.
The Land Constitution also provides for the possibility that the Landtag may deprive the Prime Minister of his trust and elect a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be examined in a legally sound manner," said Thumler.
"You will discuss all questions in peace, if they are legally soundly examined."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but something curious".
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She called herself a follower of black-green.
The Greens called on the renegade MEPs to return their Landtag mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will return her Landtag mandate, which she has received via the green Land list, with immediate effect," said the regional presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The Group leader of the Greens, Anja Piel, said: "We very much regret the decision taken by Elke Twesten".
She had deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters, but also a betrayal of Red-Green," wrote the head of the Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the state parliament re-elected quickly.
The exit of Twesten costs Red-Green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician presented her personal interests to the welfare of the country "in her injured vanity and in her frustration", criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty intrigue game and is trying to make political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony's CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his deputies include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the result of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was at that time the strongest force before the SPD, but SPD and Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament.
Agriculture Minister in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How did the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) will speak and answer in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp.
On the consumer protection portal www.Food Warning.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after everything we know at the moment, a health hazard is virtually ruled out.
Now Aldi is taking over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the reconnaissance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economics?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the German crisis became known.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, as well as manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are transportable and harmless to health.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue level of 0,005mg/kg, they are not commercially viable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time it's not the companies' fault.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, production plants are not directly responsible.
On the contrary, they have to expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in the event of an emergency.
Is there only a lack of staff or coherent competence?
It was just the official controls that exposed the process.
However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the handing over to the public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may exist are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect full information from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
As a result of the stockpile, manufacturers, distributors and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be worked consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and without interruption.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the leading organization that has overseen the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but have to counter with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred enormous debts in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - a club with potential and then heavily invested to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher affair.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.
And even though Platini fell out of favor by the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to campaign to discourage excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the replacement sum of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years can be shown in the annual financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, has hit the PSG with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014/15 season remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial supervision by inflating their revenues through companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come through payments from the Organising Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and such a maneuver could be easy to find out for UEFA regulators.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015/16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association assumes that the turnover will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers go and tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"As soon as a country owns a club, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced on-board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to come to a possible end: the airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Northwestern Switzerland" from Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the speaker.
Around 17 million small red and white chocolate tablets of 14 grams each year distribute the flight attendants to the passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwestern Switzerland" to be between 1.5 and 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs.
But the advertising effect is always more important: for a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
The Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to try to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate boards on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migros' daughter, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
Swiss introduced the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are spoiled with treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, business class passengers from Lindt and Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey is also distributed on short-haul routes, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Discus Olympic Champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup finals
The three-time world champion is fighting for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup final and could only watch the discus competition from the grandstand.
Also with the first attempt the Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s-Grunge era (when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they managed nevertheless the impossibility to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more by the watering can principle, including a riff on the stalker movies of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, a character browses through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates, and "a series of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-evil-like plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excurses are the best part of the franchise.
It's a lot of fun to see the ever-young Mr. Rudd showing Matt Dillon's underlip beard from "Singles", whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he achieves what I take as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the gang how they will attend the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-against-West wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director states that he is a TV series found: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronised by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to look at (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.
Six long episodes drag on, and the comedy is not fast enough or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", who was edited to a smaller length, could deliver his agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef visit the American Embassy again and again, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for a feast.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and with their own.
Slash against drug mafia in the country
The police have managed a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor's office Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 accused persons between 25 and 77 years of age were arrested and arrest warrants were already issued.
In addition, the officials secured large amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested during simultaneous raids in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two Italian suspects.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, over 300 police officers were in action.
Members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail.
Since summer 2016, the state prosecutor's office in Konstanz has been investigating organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the public prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo, and the investigators of the Rottweil police had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale operation was also accompanied by four Palermo officials on Wednesday morning.
The main focus of the investigations was on Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is also likely to be the result of the gang.
Weise complains of large gaps in the foreigner register
"Data from citizens who should not show up": According to a report, the foreigner register in Germany has considerable shortcomings.
This led to sometimes serious misdecisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to large gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners.
Weaknesses in the data registered there could lead to "partially serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned Weise in an analysis, which is available from the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
According to the register, 10 million people of foreign nationality are registered, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by about 600 foreign aliens offices in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and who should actually no longer appear in the register."
"Failure to enter data can significantly slow return processes," continues the report.
In addition, statistics on people who are obliged to leave include EU citizens who do not have to leave.
However, such false allocations led to "a distorted debate on how to deal with those who had to leave," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government seems to have started sending refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy when they entered from there.
This is the result of an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
According to the paper, the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures "in relation to families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this has been virtually impossible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees are the responsibility of the EU state they first reach.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that country may send him back to the country of entry.
The Office is now writing: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased considerably".
Italy provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, spokesman for the left-wing party in the Bundestag, criticised this decision: "Families with children are threatened by conditions contrary to human rights and endangering the welfare of children because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system".
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach were already provided by the blood donation service for other people.
At least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Above all Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, at the municipal council meeting, the community appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is brilliant how our body is designed for this and we pay respect to the donors who make their blood available to strangers, even more unselfishly," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, Head of the German Red Cross (DRK), as the canned foods are decomposed into their components.
That way, three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year, we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK Head of Public Service.
Obviously, the change to the Theaterhaus a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Prior to that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter each gave 500 milliliters of their life juice ten times.
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "inert" when it kept interest rates on family income in the midst of increasing pressure.
Policy makers of the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 in favour of keeping interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month aiming for an increase as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in autumn.
But it signaled that interest rate hikes would become necessary in the coming years to curb Brexit-driven inflation, and it said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut economic package issued a year after Brexit.
It will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £15 billion more under this system - with £115 billion.
Minutes after deciding on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on households' real incomes continues to strain consumption."
As regards interest rates, it reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "something larger" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "step by step" and "limited".
The Bank's downwardly adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after these messages.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for an interest rate rise and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although the Bank will recover slightly towards the end of the year.
The recent inflation report showed little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases, as the tightening is getting worse first before it will improve.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the fall in income over the next few years, but she added that wages will "clearly" recover at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it is likely that it will take four years for this to reach prices and the economy in full.
Prior to the Bank's last ruling on interest rates, the call for an increase in interest rates had increased as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell last month from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said it was expected to do so and will pick it up again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess in relation to its 2% target was "all" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is expected to become more competitive again, as lenders are looking loudly for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals expire and the new mortgages close, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September following a fight before the High Court against the funding of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prevention (PREP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after the appeal court had confirmed last year a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention (PREP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is available in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medication can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted, received and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said, "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said, "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with a high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV."
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV, and that it will help to bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society'.
Living the Great Life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earl's Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi's architectural and design studio Duck & Shed from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.
"The steel mill is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but putting on the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms in full height on top of each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic retrouvius copper light window looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses by Joanne.
Through the perception of a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering art went in there," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very lightly."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the floor space - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the ground."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time to use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can turn into something quite amazing due to good design and increased square meters of something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you could choose not to leave this.
Brothers fighting for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers find themselves four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since the family bought a store on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the City Centre, the Brunswick and Sorrento development areas, the Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.
A court file states that this means that Colin owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed conciliations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages containing affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was a little kid (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property amicably with their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when he left the company.
Both Lukas and Mark, Paul says, "have become embittered by the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin was very restrained, although he was a former AFL board member and, after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, was the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by text message to say "I really can't say much" because the case is before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution."
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," wrote Colin.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports, in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the White House's new chief of staff, met with executives on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to repair: bad information that came into the President's hands.
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he got good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television commercial is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from positions that were convincing," said former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more fuel without their intervention.
We will probably never know anything about the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his employees have managed to keep him away from trouble several times, then their efforts have paid off.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting material to Trump that might promote their views of the world.
Politico - quite concerned with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he insists on finding out where they come from.
This is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter for harassment, or that he offered no concrete evidence, or that he had made false accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and started questioning employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards this summer to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the wanted criminals are naturally not known, hints from the population are hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday on the action that follows the "EU Most Wanted" Advent calendar of winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees hide from holiday destinations, according to Europol.
21 postcards were compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
The website www.eumostwanted has been available since 2016, and has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online searches have been arrested so far, at least 11 of them due to information after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate over a ditch and return to the Millionaires series
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are back at war with some determined travelers who have negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the "millionaires series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council in order to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unimpeded to find a way.
Angry residents have pressed the advice of Solihull, who said that it is "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday night after being sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back again.
More arrived last night, probably even more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long teachings to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue to pay my community tax if the council can't even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be called said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area."
A Spokeswoman of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the land beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihulls police. We take the necessary legal steps to move on as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we will present our case."
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is due to be reopened on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income from the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial at that time in the municipal council.
But Freudenstadt's Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel's location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house at that time.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction debris containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings were partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is remodeled, new windows are installed.
Everything should become "beautiful close to the citizen", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a jewel out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are included.
One does not want to position oneself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale downtown level, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to set itself up broadly, explains Scherer further.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel.
He had already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The city's ideas were identical to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to make a precise determination.
Just under a million euros, he reckons.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: US Special Investigator Uses Grand Jury
According to a report, special investigator Robert Mueller appointed a so-called Grand Jury in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump.
The panel has started work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper regarded the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
The channel CNN reported that there were already first subpoenas of the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence has long been accusing the Kremlin of having intervened specifically in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there have been agreements between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as Republican advisors during the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also looked more and more at Trump's private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that special investigator Trump had personally come to the center and investigated the accusation that the president might have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Juries is to examine available evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether to bring charges.
Grand juries are therefore also called indictments.
In most cases, they are switched on when these are larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The panel may also be called on by the public prosecutor’s office to summon persons to be heard under oath.
According to the channel CNN, subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his then campaign leader Paul Manafort were also present at the meeting.
Legal experts said on Thursday night on US television that the appointment showed that Mueller did not let himself be intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it did not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury would be called in at the end in order to decide on the imposition of an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"Russia history is a total invention," Trump said.
The issue gives the Democrats an opportunity to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about."
His special adviser Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he knew nothing about the establishment of a grand jury.
But they usually work in secret, he emphasized.
The White House supported any measures that speeded up the work of the Special Investigator in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey had said three times that the president was not under investigation.
There was no reason to believe that this had changed, the statement added.
However, Mueller had only been deployed after Trump had fired Comey.
Because of this expulsion, accusations against Trump had become loud that he wanted to obstruct the justice system.
In June, Comey announced to a Senate committee that Trump had asked him to stop investigating Michael Flynn, then national security adviser.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his staff.
This triggered speculation about whether Trump wanted to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent special investigator from Congress, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired from the Department of Justice at the pressure of the President.
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, according to which the special investigator could no longer be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Gigantic Iceberg Drives in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached from the shelf ice.
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The Colossus, which weighs more than a trillion tons and measures 5,800 square kilometers, is now heading north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.
There is no danger to humans.
According to researchers, the extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking down the iceberg is unclear.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken colossus was a part of the Larsen C shelf ice.
Ice shelf floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
Thus it grows ever further into the sea and breaks off regularly.
The Larsen C Ice Shelf is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this shelf ice, the balance of growth and abortion was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete shelf ice had disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen C shelf ice is also in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of shelf ice and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it results from melting itself.
However, the loss of the shelf ice means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.
This may increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British Antarctic Observation Research Project (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen C Ice Shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with an area of almost 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
That's where it breaks off regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary from Swansea University in the UK.
"This is the furthest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists it is controversial whether the Larsen C shelf ice will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the destruction of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice-smelts of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, since the 1950s the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres.
The increase in temperature had contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the fastest-growing areas in the world.
CDU wants house tariff with staff
As it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU demands to leave the employers' association in order to become more attractive.
It was only shortly before the summer break that the county day waved through 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now again 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teaching positions in the circle are obviously very much sought after.
Around 620 applications were made for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently there are still 50 unoccupied posts in the district of Mettmann.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as general administration staff are sought.
The CDU wants to take the initiative in the district congress together with the FDP and the UWG and to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the parties' wishes, the administration should "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but also to counter the shortage of applicants in the future, it is said.
The overall concept should be oriented both internally and externally, show concrete measures for lateral beginners and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were not known in the past.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
There is talk of a genuine "competition of public employers".
In addition, there is a large number of employees leaving the service due to illness or age.
It is therefore high time to act, so that there are no more vacancies left unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the CDU's political group, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He recently caused a fist-thick surprise in the district day when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cap and amazed the other parties.
Peoples want all possibilities to be reviewed that make it possible to leave the local employers' association.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should seek a house tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities", says Völker.
In this way, the CDU tries to pay employees and civil servants better than the public service tariff regulations actually provide.
Salaries are currently strictly prescribed, and increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, district councillor Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy tightens the tone to NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs deploying lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came one day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German relief organization 'Jugend Rettet' because their team had effectively worked with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations made by the Italian public prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only judge all the allegations that are currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is assumed that his crew will take dinghy migrants on board, delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not entail "essential changes or disabilities" in their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors without Borders (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue operations has fallen sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and to cooperate with the local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
For this three friendly guides were available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, vantage point lined up at vantage point, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days there were again many meters of altitude.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing brine in the open-air inhalatory.

After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had come to know the Palatinate Forest at its best - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equips for e-sports
Will the sports stars be sitting in front of computer consoles instead of sweating through over the stadium lawn in the wind and weather?
The fact is that e-sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, followed later by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says Jochen Röttgermann, Managing Board member.
He is sure that "there are still several clubs on this train".
Next weekend, the FIFA World Football Association is organizing the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where gamers from different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, you could be present online on these markets far more often than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is this about?
Computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA are contested at the competition level during e-sports.
As in normal sport, leagues have long been established in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly getting used to.
For a long time Ingo Froböse also dealt with the question.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid response.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classic sports.
The scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are travelling internationally, which is like a large global family, because there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros had been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.
In three years, the turnover is expected to be 130 million.
Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is little.
However, e-sport is "not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Internationally, many countries are already further.
Major markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSports competition provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport has been introduced as a subject of instruction, says Froböse.
According to Dutt, in the Netherlands and France, first division football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports division.
"In the European comparison, Germany lags behind", explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
To fall into nostalgia, and to glorify the old times, is no longer enough today.
The aim was to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," says Dutt.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only football stays the way it always was."
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are now affected by the scandal of poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and took all the eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been proven not to contain fipronil are to be placed on the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of the lyrics that impell Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months behind bars and five years suspended on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who killed himself on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal.
She had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with her hands folded and eyes facing down when she was condemned.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance that she totally regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find out that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, have a significant influence on her actions".
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying that "there is no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all the pain that we will carry with us for eternity," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she would be "traced" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"Not having that only person I've been with since I was born every day is a pain that I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she benefit from the case through any press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini lame of FC Bayern
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to compete as captain at the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner for a big season - extra motivation does not hurt.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich immediately saw, even though the additional garment was very, very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer could be seen, he made the bandage he was assigned to hold on to his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the Confed Cup winner afterwards, after his first assignment as Bavarian captain.
Well, the match could have been better than the 0-2 against the SSC Naples.
But that's how Kimmich could interpret the coach's sign.
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who was chosen to lead the game in the C-Elf, which was made up of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come from the holiday.
Sugar is best distributed to those to whom you trust a lot, who want to keep in good spirits.
So those who have been chosen to take up the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: to take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew across the field as a mini-lame.
Right back, that's his position now, the white bandage on the arm did its rest.
And at all, Kimmich seemed like the one who could best take the rudder into his hand in this starting formation.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unrecorded troupe.
He had the look for the whole thing, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness (hardly clapped); Renato Sanches with it, on Teufel comes out to tie on to the achievements of the Asia trip (folded also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with it, in their first appearance in the Bavarian jersey not to be noticed negatively.
After all, that worked out quite well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acting sovereignly.
The Napoli storm, which was well-occupied, was often difficult, and Süle also tried to build a few successful games.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped it would be".
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Shift of play, tempo change: "I was brought for this style as well".
How unfamiliar this world of Bavaria is for the new arrivals, one could see after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but certainly six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said good-bye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I have already noticed what is going on here.
With Bayern you simply have to win every game".
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new guy any more.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's best-known footballer announced himself on Twitter shortly before the match and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian legionary is quasi clubmate of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and is feverish with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian Footballer of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational shot.
Perhaps our ladies could well use the famous Bavarian shower.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Trier Company Association (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which has blocked Lemke all".
Natus sees the biggest reversal in infrastructure policy: the close of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry is hoping for a plan approval procedure, and the construction law is due to be in place by 2021.
The western bypass of Trier also plays a role in the plans of the country, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan.
The aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokesman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
As suggested by Wissing, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier aims to create a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sagging for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new Master Bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is planned for the passed master's examination and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years after the master's training.
But the homework list for the country remains long.
The planned road construction is quick to create facts, while the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to hire mobility from Wissing at the state-owned company, only 29 are currently filled.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group Vice-President Christian Baldauf refers to calculations made by the Court of Auditors, which invests more than 20 million euros less in national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a country's concept of how to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
Furthermore, the existing broadband expansion in the country is disillusioning.
In 2016, regional companies rated the network supply in an IHK survey only with a grade of 3.4.
They complained about stagnant Internet connections and disruptions.
Former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and is still on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where it cleared the field again after four months due to disagreements.
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", and that it referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to car manufacturers of installing plants to neutralise exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of spoiling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies try to avoid the faults of Volkswagen, which used so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but returned under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi in Germany was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent the emission regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously burden Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to join in, tomorrow Saturday a raft will pass through Munich, which has a special message.
If you are drawn to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a common raft with Isar tourists.
It's the building department that wants to clear up.
On the raft you can see a large information transparent.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The launch of a public campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ..." the understanding of the Isar as a protected wild river should sharpen.
Already last summer the raft crossed the Isar and this year there are also other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo's tuber nose and laughter against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon artists, the tubers of his characters are his trademark.
At 85, the Argentinian still draws and works on a film.
His message: laughter, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his early years as an artist, he worked through himself as a draftsman for greeting cards, among other things - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job was lost," he once said.
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Time and again the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, roundish Mordillo figures romp around in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own statements, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, T-shirts, plush toys and watches, his droll figures continue to find widespread distribution worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a centipede as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is scheduled to be released on the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he rather relies on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordless.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-like conditions and disease-borne insects, causing great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil attracts not only holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
The solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing of evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Krämer, guilds, dealers, vagants or a Landsknecht camp should be experienced in the city centre on these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce normally meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings suffice.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter is their editor and inspiration of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings have been initiated.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists’ murderers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we don't trust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated as "Twelve River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan freely.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot in the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, there was an interview in February with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined forces with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to pursue journalism without encountering the drug problem," said Bojorquez.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting research without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He volunteered to admit that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you're playing dumb.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many deaths ... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the joker who could curse like a dock worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
You trusted his routine.
He'd always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his ruin?
His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "Geruch a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, cell phones were suddenly not allowed. Days earlier, it was announced that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half in a joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police that the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending, which focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have regarded Valdez's column as the best-informed source on the kidnapping.
"In the past we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of its slender body structure.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The Valdez office has been re-dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration about another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington, D.C., trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
She has since asked that she be reclassified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by order of politicians and security forces involved in organized crime.
Last year, the media watchdog group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to shut up," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas Cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue their work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all of their phones suddenly started humming.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.
From the kerb edge they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the policemen who were guarding to see if they were on standby.
If they were even afraid, they wouldn't show it.
The Riodoce employees followed in his footsteps under the enormous portrait of the founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa.
"How can you even think about closing it," said Bojorquez, "when the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaurs used cover to avoid their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one.
Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of a "disquieting past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur exemplars in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has puzzled researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.
Fossil, who was discovered by him, was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy lump of earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it was asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur exemplars - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that although this herbivore is covered with armor and resembles a walking tank, it is likely to have been threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a shielding technique known as countershading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have made it possible to mix better in its environment and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours uncovering it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the countershading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although countershading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure by flesh-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use countershading -- think of deer, zebras, or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaur predators must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for evidence of his life, including his preserved intestine contents, to find out what he ate as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but it is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you just shriek a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he's asleep."
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank into the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips protruding from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herbivore was washed through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved his armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right forefoot is at his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole'.
In the thunderstorm: Mass Carambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass karambolage.
There are numerous injured, kilometre-long traffic jams - and Gaffer.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass karambolage on late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, about 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen junctions (Aichach-Friedberg district) nearly 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, crashed into each other during a thunderstorm.
At first, no information was available on the exact number of casualties.
It was mild to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman.
A large contingent of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a ten-kilometre-long backlog formed.
As reported by an AZ reporter, massive obstructions also occurred on the counter-railway - due to numerous Gaffers.
The fire department noted the registration plates of the vehicle drivers, who now have to reckon with sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 6:45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There had been a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: you sit on the train and sleep without knowing anything.
Or you're immersed in your work and you have a brilliant idea right now.
And then: pufff.
Comes the conductor and wakes you up uneasy or rips the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the conductorless ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your place and devalue the ticket.
At present, a test operation is running on two routes.
"When the offer arrives, we extend it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said a rail spokesman.
"Komfort Check-in" is the name of the train's ticket evaluation without a conductor.
In order to be able to use these, however, some prerequisites have to be met: You need a smartphone or tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - what most passengers already do.
You also have to buy it via the app of the train that DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway.
And finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call your ticket under "My tickets".
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear in the test customers.
Train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant checks the ticket, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket in place Y.
So you can keep sleeping, keep working, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed through our train attendants without ticket control, simply check in at the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board member of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Anyone who often travels by train knows that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are one of the biggest nuisances.
Because often you have yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the ID card is missing or another document you have to present.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large area and delays in controlling your own ticket and ultimately takes the conductor the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet activated.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the one born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone in high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," they said.
Confused because no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She dropped off her cell phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father carrying a sign saying, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer released his rifle and shouted, "I will kill you... animals all."
"That's not common," Ferrell remembered her statement.
"That's not the kind of murder we've gotten used to and that we can call typical."
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and cried."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from the 11th century onwards.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resistance that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, they discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her," Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and black constitution, and what we need to do to become free, to free ourselves.
Even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any blatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman child.
I feel like I'm doing her a bad service, keeping her away from it."
The first stop when they arrived at Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for Officer Darren Wilson's possible non-prosecution.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9th," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can take advantage of?"
This scepticism has been nurtured by countless cases of people, often white people, in a community that has benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We talk," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because this is how I will be represented."
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she turned out to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who coined the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really being maintained by black women and many black women".
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action", in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up this energy," she said.
"It's no coincidence, even though she was on the front line, because there's so much at stake in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21⁄2 years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and feels committed to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "dream" to "great delusion": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people, although it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold doesn't leave much of the subject.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), it comes from the other side: "No human breath" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Größenwahn!" (Lars Scholz).
While the proponents rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the business, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the site where the Bauernmarkthalle is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the beginning of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - namely to the Beda square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the Bauernmarkthalle almost weekly for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always very gladly.
We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, too, there are.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
But this should not be very low for the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There's already enough of that in our town.
You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved for us.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also cheap.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not wearable for a retailer.
Too bad, there's almost no more special business and what's left of it will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the Bauernmarkthalle go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes.
Or does the ghost Bit-Galerie already manage to drive out all business from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "This is just not going to work.
And no one needs a shopping center that's empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers' market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall, there is no place in Bitburg thanks to the incredibly many - as I find - senseless construction projects.
If the Bauernmarkthalle is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly alike - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison term after she made secret diplomatic reports public on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.
Through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning, Dewey-Hagborg has created from the 30 portraits of what someone with these genomic data could look like, a sharp, though somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has been openly talking about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud, and theft.
Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white selfie in which Manning was visibly uncomfortable sitting in a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal pen pals who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book "Suppressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and they would be able to see the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama was actually demanding Manning's release after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison just a few days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy encounter.
There is something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, too, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to resolve.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which was gender, race, sexuality and culture" with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart).
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how astonishingly similar we are, at least biologically, by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's highly developed scientific lexicon).
"What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on view.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.
She shows Manning showing up with a hands-free phone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King Kong.
"If they shut down your speech, they won," they say.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't personally seen the exhibition yet - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do so, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacrs, which gather together like hordes of protesters.
This was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 " 2, Manning's stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said from the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford wanted for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who is being searched for as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the Cook County District Court files show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A joint warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27th.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene, and detectives investigated the stabbing as a murder, while the police actively searched for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had now been on leave and had been excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. investigation authorities in every possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident had taken place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA road map in the near future" - the Russian vice-premier Mutko
The Russian vice-premier Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the Roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the Code, which describes the criteria for re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the Organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could give rise to concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said, "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that does not exist."
Mutko's words were in agreement with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," added Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded from carrying out doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the Doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be deployed again.
Aldi no longer sells eggs for the time being
This was reported by the groups of companies.
It was a mere precaution that no health impairment could be assumed further, the Communication stated.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been shown to have been tested negative for anti-lices containing fipronil.
Aldi wants to achieve clarity and transparency with its customers.
The start-ups that will help your business not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of your e-commerce start-up with your employees, but the polls didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or - even worse - deceptive.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the trial.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She called people from the outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to snap surveys and surveys by certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can drill back why.
Companies come to realize that they need to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you don't become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in value by 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity earlier this year in the midst of the Uber case in discredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behavior.
And when the Chief Executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that he or she was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of employment experience," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and burden companies with recurring charges for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in financing in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising total capital to $47 million.
Glittering secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total financing to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only deployments.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company that owns their voices, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are committed and committed.
If the third-party analytics tools promise to increase the commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you're asking for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, which has seen companies that have relied too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow employees will ask themselves, "Did you really hear me?
Will you take care of it?
And if you don't take care of it, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, Errett said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights about its employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better engagement of employees in an industry that is known for high sales.
"If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It starts at 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players talk on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have stripped off their jersey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three UCLA training sessions should start at 7:15 p.m. to meet the players' already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and did practical exercises for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood during the summer school.
They are supposed to hold 18 exercises during August. 20 before the formal game preparations begin for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the NCAA's change of rules, even if it added another point to the players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just squeezed it through, they keep plowing, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the upper class that has already been attacked with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a gate post.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"That's a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then get ready to record an exercise there.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it is a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot eight.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third-party fact reviewers and then display their results under the original post, said the world’s largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect potential misreporting and send them to fact reviewers who may be showing results of fact review from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as they did before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook stated in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact review will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to finding out what stories are challenged by third-party fact reviewers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, little Scotney Castle was featured in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mopy Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: in 2014 he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were there himself.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome a little") this all seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who were working on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and started writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown as the National Trust did not gain full access until 2006 when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years when aristocrats said, "Oh, throw it in the attic."
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch tree that two families fought for.
Guys, let everything go his way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two of them are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell is portrayed, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, making debts over and over again and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys with a talent to advertise heiresses."
After the end of his assignment in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He made a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the grounds of an early 20th century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life again."
Campaign started: over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf covered
With the unveiling of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand (round view from Thursday).
Until Thursday Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too good for us.
Right?" ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Kapelle.
"We don't really think that (of course!)", they write on their website that was activated yesterday.
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we firmly believe that we, as Bad Honnefer citizens, are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is important to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling point."
Finally, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new roof brand and campaign for an average five-digit amount.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps in Ankara.
This week, too.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as in the past, but in the Prime Minister's seat.
Under the chairmanship of the Head of Government, the five vice-premiers as well as the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions.
Thus, the civilians in the YAS were outnumbered.
The government pulls the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy were deposed.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt.
486 people, who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt, have been negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the overthrow attempt a "gift of God" because he gave him the opportunity to "clean up" the armed forces completely.
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unhappiness in Military Headquarters".
In the General Staff there were concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, were manifesting itself in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the major clean-up of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7395 state servants fired by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan tamed the military.
The generals were formerly considered to be the real masters of the country.
Three times they coupped, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least by relying on the reform requirements of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately driving forward an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer, who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, after the purges, there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army to take action.
The management structures and operational skills are "weakened", Nato diplomats say.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for a reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries are given green cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renovate track for Rennsteigshuttle
Again and again in the past months the future of the Rennsteigshuttle had been disputed - now it should go very quickly.
Before the end of the year, it is planned to build the marauding route on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to secure the future of the Rennsteig shuttle in the long term, construction work on the track is to start this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, which is particularly important for tourism," said Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of repairing the line was about 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finalised, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as operators already agreed on the technical details.
"This means that the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company would be concluded for a period of 11 years.
With this, the Rennsteig shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular railway service between Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations.
In recent months, it has been tested during a pilot operation whether the route is used by sufficient numbers of people to order it regularly again in the future.
The route is also very dilapidated in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it couldn't get crazier in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes up.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his convictions and choose everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventure" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible," enthuses True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation, or she can be "in the mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one takes a step towards Frigid (here is called: reluctant) Farrah, disturb one the most.
On his website True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" says the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they remain on the fringes of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks out of the fringes can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are under threat worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of having sexually assaulted women.
The most daunting aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Handmaid') is not the graphic images, the entwined bodies and the pierced eyes, but how realistic this vision looks.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, to put it in a nutshell, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots don't represent real women.
They can't separate from their companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: maids
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also divided small-format families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with Trump's elective relatives' horrors.
We're all supposed to try to burst our filter bubbles.
Trump's power to bring families together has been less noted.
I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she had fought with for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite strangely on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it strikes me in a wider context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that his kittens will not repel us one day.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reasonableness compared to his standards.
Today I find myself infested by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the roof of the car, which is 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, in comparison to Trump, are indeed considered to be very mild crimes.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are hugely large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are grumpy and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders full of fear - extremely dark and the shimmering music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience, as two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on here and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street, it's the same thing, plus the option to match the score with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which none is required.
The poor woman in the department store was apologically grinning, while I was tired of having the experience of giving her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which he suffered after a case in his cell, according to prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first manslaughter sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention this time to appeal against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, of which they say she is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were dismissed into the holidays and the secondary schools.
Three of the students will go to secondary school in the future, four to secondary school.
Headmaster Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public on Tuesday evening in the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen.
As a symbol of school leave, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle that grew up in the chicken farm but was then released into freedom.
In addition, the lively band performed a musical entitled "Der Adler im Hühnhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and had it hatched by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken broke, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young goblets that wore cylinders for the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said headmaster Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chickens), but belongs to it.
He'll never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wanted every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.
This was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who keeps jumping in at classroom bottlenecks, and the parents' representatives.
The chick time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She hates to release her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she could have relied on the fourth graders.
At the end, all the students played a song of summer time and holiday season.
There was great joy among the children.
Eight first graders have already been enrolled for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, reported.
On the morning of August 1st, police arrested a group of illegal people in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and impose substantial fines on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court could impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What people need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust gas performance of cars in the Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 emission classes.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the coming months, but have not yet indicated a precise date.
Daimler has announced that it will contact every person concerned.
If an inspection is already due, it will be done within its scope.
How long should the total number of upgrades go?
"It's hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers have not so far acted voluntarily on the subject of the environment."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
According to Smetanin, foreign manufacturers would probably be following suit.
Is there a threat of a massive drop in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But precisely in the regions where driving bans are threatening.
There has been no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honoured.
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
The winner Lear, known for his progressive TV series, has therefore already announced that he will not participate in the gala.
The "New York Times" he said: "This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and that is burdening me."
59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living in
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city architect, retires next year.
The job has already been advertised, but suitable candidates are scarce.
Wacker has been a city architect for 31 years.
And the work is still great fun for him, as he mediates in the press talk.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
In this way - with due regard for the regular notice periods - there should be still enough time for an induction.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Building Law Authority for the Administrative Community, the applicant must present appropriate degrees.
Because the city definitely wants to keep this function.
If they were no longer able to fill them out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to citizens is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good working climate as well as good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, several important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living in," he is sure about the building office and its employees.
However, varied projects will also be on the agenda in the future: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen car park, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the renovation of the stadium is still a topic.
The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
There is great scope for a city architect to design.
With Haslach's own building yard and gardening, many things could be reacted quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is protected as a monument, it is important to have "an eye for what fits in", when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city architect emphasizes.
In any case, the city architect bears high responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end, everything's going over my table."
He can count on many years of support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (Building Construction) has been with us for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Low Construction) has been with us for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to stay for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify with the job and stay."
Because continuity is not only important for a good business climate, but also for the further design of the city.
According to the City of Haslach, if you want to inherit Roland Wacker, you should have a degree in architecture as a graduate engineer or a bachelor's degree and have good expertise in the fields of building regulations and building planning law.
The City Building Office is responsible for building and civil engineering, construction planning, land acquisition matters, administration of the urban properties, municipal farm with building yard and town gardening as well as lower building law authority including monument protection.
Bike thrown on lines: South railway line blocked
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators are based on two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night hours.
Near the scene a pink scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses.
"This goes far beyond a lukewarm stroke," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and would also endanger train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant as well as the delay minutes and the costs for the rail replacement traffic, also pönalen of the railway customers could come to the perpetrators.
Overall, a "significant" sum is to be expected, said the speaker.
The damage was repaired again on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be conducted without hindrance.
Nearly ten passenger trains had been cancelled on Friday morning, two of which concerned long - distance traffic.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammation of bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While patients are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of causing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result.
Experiments have shown that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal milieus, if the same system also works in humans.
The postdoc Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain that was housed separately did not have this.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiomes of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequenced and six types of bacteria were found, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.
Mice were reared in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they developed the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells that were isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic has signed a "genius", believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's £40 million signature began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last preseason game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira advanced at will.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues' preparation Asia tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of its four priority new commitments.
"Getting three out of four, for that I thank the club," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've put a lot of effort into it."
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in US state of Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner across the US, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a dreamliner to be.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously done such advertising.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low blow for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, social democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no noise from the party headquarters, just no headwind from the federation - that was the most important wish of the election fighters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees from the Willy Brandt House have been watching the events in the SPD-controlled state capitals with increasing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with headwind.
They were low blows.
One at a time.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions between the SPD and the Greens.
"This once again shows that Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising departure of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the elections, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the apostate Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the voter's will.
Elke Twesten must immediately give back her mandate," said the Federal Executive and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"This can't be true," sighs a SPD election fighter when the new message of Job reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands after the transition of the green deputies Elke Twesten to the CDU without a government majority.
It is the provisional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The Miserere began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A black eye, no more, the comrades calmed down at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different.
Then it became - and everything got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to tumble, the Düsseldorf-Pleite knocked the party down.
The comrades struggled to get up again in the weeks after.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And with him came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country chief, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because in crisis communication after that, he was doing pretty much everything wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust affair and its role on the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has long been in criticism.
Bad survey results were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has tried to set more and more accents in the Federation in recent weeks.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were not hidden by comrades around Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to be granted because they promised Weil a stabilisation of the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
In doing so, Weil is basically not to blame for the party-internal dispute between the Lower Saxon Greens.
And certainly not Schulz.
For this reason, the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here above all at the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is intolerable and democratic how Mrs. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the country list of the Lower Saxon Greens, the Lower Saxon MEP continues.
The logical consequence would be to return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, laments an "undemocratic manoeuvre".
"The voter's will four years ago was clear: People have made Stephan Weil the prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the leading candidate in the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the election result," Oppermann continued.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments by the CDU Niedersachsen.
Funding for the centre of town III
If you want to renovate your old house, you can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Urban Development informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a review of what has happened so far.
Since 1991, Empfingen has been in renovation areas.
At that time, in the redevelopment area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding.
In the redevelopment area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - it is also important to promote interior development and not only to open up new construction areas.
On 4 April, the Karlsruhe Government Bureau had received information that there would be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding amounted to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros came from the country, the rest from the municipality Empfingen.
How does a redevelopment area come about?
According to Schindler, one will investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role to renovate whether there is any interest in the planned area at all.
If necessary, the territorial borders could then also shift again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-state program "Social City", in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of housing and employment conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object-based basis, i.e. per plot of land.
The redevelopment area would then finally be defined as a statute.
Since 1 January 2017, the grant period for the funding has been running until 30 April 2026.
By September of this year, however, the inventory would first be carried out, under which the persons involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, the statutes will be adopted as far as possible, so that the reorganisations can be started next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It is a question of assessing the grievances of urban planning and deciding when and to what extent it will be rehabilitated.
For the respective property then also a renovation notice is entered in the land register.
Pietzschmann will come to Empfingen again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent postally to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land sheet", which deals among other things with the structural condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing sheet", data on the size, distribution and inhabitants of a dwelling can be provided.
The blue "company form" must only be filled in if premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not an application for funding at the same time.
In addition, new construction measures were not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies works according to the "first-aid principle" - whoever comes first grinds first.
One could not "reserve" funding for later.
At the end, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown to make the participants a "tasteful" renovation.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get in house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to military figures left to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heart of the July 17 event in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was exhibited alongside a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House Military Bureau demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this, because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at around 7 a.m. for the event at 3 p.m., and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the White House departure was delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of duty hours.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
It was not clear from the records made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate the determination.
"One question we asked was whether it was an infringement of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked," answered the deputy commander.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President initiated the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But requesting their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential aircraft provided taxi services against the backdrop of its first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and its Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor.
"The White House is excited about the show "Made In America" - showing products from all 50 states produced by American workers using American materials," said Lindsay Walters, deputy press secretary of the White House.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights in the Washington area and in the South Lawn to drop the US president at the White House with precise centimeter sets.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said one official.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidency support missions".
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
Sikorsky's spokesman said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not have budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to U.S. Defense Department hourly rates for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below this rate.
"Determining the cost to taxpayers based on estimates of reimbursement rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include the personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, the former White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea this week is to present things that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire engine.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before tricky task
==References====External links==*FIFA profile*FIFA profile*FIFA profile*FIFA profile
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will start tomorrow from 11 a.m. in Kiel at the table third Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five games, the top player of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has maintained a sense of reality.
Team chief Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Especially in the rear positions I find the team very good."
For class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV especially the imports from the far north provide.
"The Danes and Finns can even point to Davis Cup appearances.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay with a view of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"As always, this is going to be difficult for us.
You also need a good dose of luck."
The Neusser team for the trip to the far north is practical.
His debut for Blue-White could be Maxime Janvier.
If the French player currently still active in the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not make it to the Bundesliga, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) who is playing at the tournament in the Czech Liberec will make his first appearance this season.
The so far unconquered Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
He was to be present in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cognina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at Alster, Máté Valkusz could also join the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still the number one junior world ranking in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills up the squad.
How America can harm OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed the law to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday night.
"In his haste to pass the law," Congress had put in a few "unconstitutional regulations," he etched.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed against the US push.
After all, the draft provides for the punishment of European companies that help the Russians to build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors of the Austrian OMV, which together with other European companies co-finances the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea management Nord Stream 2, have been concerned.
The threatening backdrop is enormous.
Nevertheless, it was too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
Indeed, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
He has 12 weapons to choose from.
"The press" looked at which of the companies could ward off and which could really hurt him.
Narco's Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be put in the spotlight in Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos revealed by Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's series is far from over.
The seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first one received its first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Wheelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Roll backwards: The city hires 46 kitchen helpers
The city organizes the day care table itself.
With fixed contact points for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the city day care centres the clock is turned back.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the city's day care centres (kitas) on its own initiative.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the youth welfare department, this is good news: "We were all very happy".
Boiling continues outside the house: a caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 day care centres in the Krefeld area, and in 44 children receive a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the last year of kindergarten, 2800 children sat at the tables, and the demand is constantly growing.
"In the meantime, not only children who are looked after for 45 hours a week are eating lunch in the day care centre," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also valid in 35-hour care, if children stay until 2 pm."
From 1 September, 46 part-timers will be in the kitchen service: they will warm up the delivered food, add salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, dispense the food, clear, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"Employees are firmly assigned to a daycare centre," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - determines the number of hours.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz, satisfied.
"In this way, they are much more involved and it is easier for the kindergarten management to implement pedagogical concepts".
This is also what it is all about: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children should help to prepare the food."
The direct connection of the Küchenkraft to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a known power in daycare, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity was important for the children.
The cleaning of the daycare rooms - also the task of the kitchen staff so far - will in future be done by special cleaning staff.
In addition to improving the quality of the kitchen service, this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has proved to be the most economical for the city in the cost comparison between self-directing and outsourcing, according to the press office.
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being re-employed.
"But these hours are not so important for around 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will run in the provincial council elections. Three women are candidates for the role of Vice President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have issued threats against an electoral process that coincide with the transition from international combat to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will hand over power peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.

Men trying to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to information from the police, the men approached the 13-year-old who was staying with friends at Kolpingstraße at around 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl's cell phone.
But the 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
One of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but failed.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB concern about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to check with managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie on the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had kept silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits among other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "be the first to know" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "explain concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward."
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and the greater Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie."
Pladis spokeswoman said: "The Tollcross branch manager received a letter from GMB Scotland just yesterday, and the company will respond directly as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, during which some questions were openly discussed.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies that operate in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. Should our operations at the site change, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know this."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Trätti
Paris Saint-Germain will not slacken in its pursuit of Neymar after making an offer of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about the world record robbery?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
After finishing, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan Board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players with them, it will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Trätti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown offender deliberately overturned a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of the estate number 30 and thus caused material damage of more than 200 euros to the disguise of the vehicle.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for clues.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car met him on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to dodge and touch the guardrail.
On Thursday evening the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was on the road towards Leese on the B 215 from Stolzenau with his VW around 19.55 o'clock.
In the area of the area around Stolzenau, a car approached him on his lane, so that he had to avoid to the right.
The Touran driver touched the guardrail.
Property damage occurred on the passenger car.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the road accident.
According to the accident victim, it can be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the commission office in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761/92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
That's what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen continues to provide for discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are the Church", declared after publication to the German Press Agency that he expects an apology from the former Bishop of Regensburg and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the retired Pope Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret over their own omissions or their false assessment of the events at the time.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticized the fact that "two measures" were used in reporting on violence among the cathedral spats.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "indecent and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal," Scaraffia writes.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "You like to go to the church and this is a found food."
She also pointed out that in her youth "clashes were a normal educational means" "to cope with naughty children, as I was one."
It would find it unfair to apply today’s standards to earlier decades, for the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on abuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often also appeared.
Author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the commemorative volume "My brother the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages), is completely wrong.
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report by the lawyer Ulrich Weber commissioned by the Bishopric of Regensburg with the Enlightenment say?
A total of 547 Regensburg cathedral spats were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 cathedral spats.
The final report says about Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be stated that Domkapellmeister R. has in many cases used forms of physical and psychological violence.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused people, it is striking that many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him."
In an interview, Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg cathedral spats relieves Georg Ratzinger.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against victims at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholerist and perfectionist, who often became tangible when a domspatz musically brought no top performance.
How do you rate this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble to read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger even appears in it.
Only eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at preschool also occurred outside his sphere of influence.
One can at best accuse him of not knowing too late or of not taking the first hint seriously enough.
The domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "salvation", "heaven" and "better world".
The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also give a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warm", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "comprehensive", as a very good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always surrounded by grapes from children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to anger outbreaks.
The fact that he not only banged with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor, but also slapped his face and pulled too cheeky boys by the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologizes for it.
In order to save him, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, both among parents and teachers.
Do you also know such methods of punishment?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I, too, have experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in preschool, these are, of course, trivialities.
One wonders, then, if it is not more to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just fallen on him.
Many who have never understood him are still busy working on the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, much has been reported in connection with the report on the issue of abuse at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused in the final report of any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted himself to the Domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were dedicated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," said one affected person on behalf of the others, "It was all very embarrassing for me."
The real problem with the investigation of sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators, as it were.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger's role in the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A student questioned put it this way: "With regard to sexual abuse ... I don't see ... any case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) of all people would have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it ... is also really absurd to assume that he of all people ... boys have opened up more forcefully or more clearly or rather than to their parents, boarding school leaders, counsellors, etc.
Talking to him about sex is unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that pupils and/or their environment affected him beforehand could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger must therefore be acquitted of any co-knowledge.
Nor can he be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to justice.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was much to read about "gewaltexzessen" at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen.
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Looking Away".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem, that everything in the coverage was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excesses of violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, again, is an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the Gymnasium der Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and, let's say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible beating pedagogy, the cases in which boys were harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly from it, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got to see the boys when they were already at the Dompatzengymnasium.
On which, as most witnesses stress, the subject of "pre-school" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradisaic" conditions.
What was different at the Dumpster High School?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and therefore, in many cases, even associate positive memories with him despite violence".
At most, this leaves the reproach of looking away.
Despite all the efforts, however, the report could only define two periods during which it was reported about preschool conditions.
The first time in 1970/71, when he began to establish himself and wanted to hear nothing about the events at a school where he did not work and was responsible (so the witness) and then only around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral School, which the report even reproduces.
In it he points out to him that "the beating sentence is still practised in preschool".
Even in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when beating sentences were long forbidden in Bavaria.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as all of us remember.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the victims might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he's always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the beating penalty at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s educational standards to those times.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "fall trick of anachronism", i.e. the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards.
The Princess is right about that.
But of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable and also not to what was committed in pre-school due to hardships and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond what was then usual.
It's all terrible and I'm glad it's finally being reworked.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. slapping and pulling the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger render in the conversations with you for the book "My brother the Pope"?
Did the subject of beatings also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book deals with the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, where the cathedral spats only played a supporting role.
Nevertheless, I do not hide that he led a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand for absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution out of the hitherto more nationally known Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and sweets alone, you don't make unruly boys into great singers and stand before every success, no matter in which field, but always discipline, passion and self-surmounting.
As what kind of person have you experienced Georg Ratzinger during the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced time and again as a wonderful, humorous, profound, deeply believing and hearty person, of whom one cannot imagine that he could even do something to one fly.
I regularly get to know how many former cathedral spats still today, 23 years after his retirement, keep in regular contact with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.
So those who still don't forgive him that he once was strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the cathedral spats today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but nevertheless also a lovable respect person, to whom they still look up today and to whom they almost worship.
And please, once again quite clearly, all that is accused of him are educational methods that were common at the time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is most unjust to make a man a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the decency would command, a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merit and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps still Germany probably no one would know the Regensburg cathedral spats, to finally leave in peace.
