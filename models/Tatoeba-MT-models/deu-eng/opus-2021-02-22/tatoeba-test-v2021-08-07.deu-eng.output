The main task of the kings was to build a tomb of which it was thought that it would seem as timeless as the stars above the sands of the time when everything else sank. The planning of the afterlife was more important than life itself, which was only the way there.

Certainly much was beautified, and in later times even battles were depicted that had not taken place.
