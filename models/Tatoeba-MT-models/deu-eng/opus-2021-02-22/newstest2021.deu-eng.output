Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a road accident occurred on the highway between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Motorist overlooks biker
A 44-year-old motorist wanted to turn left from Merklingen to Landesstraße 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim at around 9.30 p.m. with her VW.
She missed the 24-year-old motorcyclist from the direction of Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away during collision
The biker was still trying to avoid the car, but he still roamed it at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the gripping process, the hand and foot brake levers were torn off on the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to slow down.
Mentally, he steered his motorcycle in the green stiffeners next to the road and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
However, due to the collision with the car, the biker suffered an injury to the patient and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavarian Mamming, almost 500 people are quarantined and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
Security is monitoring the ban.
A total of 174 harvest workers were tested positive for the Corona-Erreger Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as the district council office Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"Unfortunately, in order to avoid further spread, we have to take this step in order to protect the population," said District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Seven employees had previously been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm, which grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers only for inlay glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with a good 3300 inhabitants near Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to remain calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people".
On the farm, infected workers were separated from non-infected workers, the site is now surrounded by a fence.
Greens and SPD gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of seasonal workers' accommodation.
"This can be bitterly revenged if such local infection events need to be exploited and regional lockdowns ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
The SPD sees this in a very similar way: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest workers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"From our point of view, it is precisely the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the housing conditions that need to be closely controlled.
This obviously didn't happen."
The outbreak had come "with announcement".
U-Bahnhof Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the track bed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station, a 19-year-old fell down by a pusher and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday there was a dispute between two youth groups at the U-Bahnhof Aidenbachstraße around 4.15 p.m.
A passer-by alerted the police, who approached with several stripes.
According to the first investigation, a Munich (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the platform edge and fell into the track bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the fallen man climb out of the track.
There was no danger from an incoming train.
According to the police, there were again clashes between the two people.
The 17-year-old fled the crime scene, but his personal details were subsequently investigated.
In the company of his father, he went to the police inspection 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Report: Seehofer urges longer retention of data
Data retention is currently suspended.
According to a media report, however, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) demands an extended retention of data - instead of the planned ten weeks a half year.
As the "Picture on Sunday" reports, Seehofer Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked for a quick amendment of the law in a letter.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He considered it useful to "immediately make necessary adjustments to the law already now", quoted the newspaper from the letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments before they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report goes on to say.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it was only when the courts had decided that it could be properly examined whether legal adjustments were necessary.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already advocated data retention in June.
NBA: Strip Club Angry for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro with the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, however, he still visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN data, is back in Isloation, is tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
Last February, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, already expressed his love for these very Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Inc.) have the best wings in the city".
On Sunday, NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter that NBA Williams has prescribed a ten-day quarantine.
This means that the Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to end the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams are preparing for the season final starting in the night on Friday with training games.
Söder expresses himself after mass infection to the corona-location
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has frightened public authorities and politics.
Almost 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and over a third have become infected with the corona agent.
The farm is now under quarantine and is closed off with a building fence.
No one is allowed to leave the grounds, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free Corona tests to the more than 3300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt so far assumes that the infections did not spread beyond the farm.
"Conscience bites": Confession of the suspected arsonist of Nantes
"My client has shown cooperativeness," said Quentin Chabert, lawyer to the newspaper.
The defender added: "He deeply regrets the actions, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was "suffered by remorse and taken very seriously by the extent of the destruction".
According to the prosecutor's office, in the event of a conviction, the man is threatened with ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Cathedral of Saint Peter and Paul in Nantes had been severely damaged during a fire on Saturday last week.
The fire had broken out in three places far apart in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect who was now detained had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after one day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly caught the eye of the investigators.
Discussing the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel recommended thinking about abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates fait accompli", said Grindel of the "Picture on Sunday".
He stressed: "The 50+1 rules do not work for the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous for Bavaria and Dortmund: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, it is not possible to get around the debate whether it is necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations wishing to break into this phalanx".
However, he had doubts as to whether there was a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority shareholdings prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga business location in a single European market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to create more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV money would not have a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are already immense among the first three clubs.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and pierced the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said about the adoption of an expensive clock that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That's been a lot of work for me humanly."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," said Grindel.
"With the ominous watch gift I have handled completely transparent and unsuspectingly.
Many in the DFB knew about it".
He had never "made a secret from the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"This may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and a dead man
The protests against police violence in the United States have intensified again due to Donald Trump's use of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday, clashes between demonstrators and police took place in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville, and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was killed by gunshots while a demonstration train was crossing a crossroads.
Previously, clashes had again occurred in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and violently disbanded demonstrators.
Hundreds, partly armed, marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student had been shot at a drug raid in her apartment in Louisville in March.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there, and no drugs were found either.
On Saturday, when a member of a group calling itself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a gun, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in mortal danger.
The police set up barricades because of the formation of local demonstrators of a white militia.
In the end, there was no meeting between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, one person was shot and died in a Black Lives Matter demonstration.
The police reportedly took a suspect into custody.
It has not yet provided any detailed information on the circumstances of the case.
Mayor Steve Adler, according to the New York Times, said he was, like many in the city, "unruly and stunned" about what had happened.
Protesters also clashed with the police in the American metropolis of Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to construction cars in front of a youth prison, the police used glare grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police or assault.
A courthouse was set on fire in the city of Oakland, California.
A small group of demonstrators had smashed windows, shot down fireworks, and blinded police officers with lasers, reported the Oakland police late Saturday night (local time).
The fire could be extinguished quickly.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car passed through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
According to the police, one of the demonstrators fired a gun and at least one person was taken injured to the hospital.
In addition, windows were also smashed in a court and a fire was set, as the police reported.
Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the large lake in the spa town was missing, visitors and actors enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, actors and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city centre was missing, the crowds and program highlights like Saale burn, Rakoczy-Ball or Festzug, so many came at their expense with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says Director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when the historical ones alone were in the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
So this time, too, in the Corona year.
The couple made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold casino, watching the historical stroll and listening to Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I find it very pleasant," says Konhäuser.
They don't miss the crowds that normally belong to Rakoczy.
But she lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic procession and the closing firework on Sunday evening.
"That's a shame.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy Reitturnier to take place again
For the actors of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant more work.
For example for Christina Gold, who participates in the procession in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was on foot in the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
"This is more exhausting, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The rider club had less to do, even if individual riders were on the road in the park.
"We very much hope that the rider quadrilla will be allowed to take place again next year," says President Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break in 2021, a Rakoczy Reit tournament will be held again.
28 Corona cases with Spanish second division club Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football second league player CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper and deeper into the crisis due to a Corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer had flown to the city of A Coruña in spite of the first Corona cases on July 20, a low blow follows the next one.
By Sunday 28 players or team members had been tested positively, one came to the hospital, as the club announced.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name south-west of Madrid still had the chance to reach the ascension playoffs.
Now even the descent into the B-group of the Second League threatens.
The game against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the prosecutor's office is investigating a possible offense against public health, the Supreme Sports Authority CSD is considering the forced descent of the club.
The players and other team members are in quarantine at a hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they have not received a fresh towel or gel," wrote the sports newspaper AS.
Photos show how players hung underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel to dry after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
The bed linen was also not changed for five days.
Another problem is food.
Neither was it good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club management, on the other hand, said that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The accusation of deliberately endangering public health was rejected by the club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
The corona rules laid down by the football association were not violated, the son of Primera Division President Javier Tebas, as reported by the Europa Press news agency and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before the departure, there had been four infected persons until 19 July, all of whom had been isolated and had not travelled with them.
Immediately before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members had been tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, other team members of the Corona test had been positive on "five or six".
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the whistle, said Tebas Llanas.
Police must catch horses torn out of steamach
Two animals were on the road.
The police led her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning, just before 6 a.m., a road user shared two free-running horses on the feeder between the Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld junction and the Theres motorway junction.
At the arrival of the officials, the horses were already between the feeder and the village of Damach.
Shortly before Dampach, the officials gained the confidence of the horses, which were able to change a rope carried in the patrol car.
Tony Martin: Career-continuation imaginable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time time trial world champion Tony Martin can well imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm working with the team to define the framework conditions for how and in what form it could continue," said the 35-year-old of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
The negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
Earlier he got up after a fall, and the first thought was: "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a small daughter, I think: What if".
The professional cyclist acknowledged that there are aspects with which he is increasingly difficult.
"But it was good for me to see what I had about cycling and how much fun I enjoyed it, based on the Corona time."
At the Tour de l'Ain (5th to 9th August), the time trial specialist enters the competition again.
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria's streets at the weekend
The beautiful weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
For at least three people, the motorcycle tour ends fatally.
Even an 18-year-old pedestrian dies.
Schönthal - In accidents on Bavaria's roads several, mostly young people died on the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was caught on Saturday at Schönthal (Cham district) by a car that came on the opposite track.
It was not clear at first why the car was on the opposite track.
In Upper Bavaria on Saturday a 22-year-old bumped into a horse-drawn carriage on his machine.
According to the Beilngries police, he was on his way downhill.
In a left-hand curve, he bounced against the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the twelve occupants of the carriage, a man was severely injured and a man slightly injured, as the police reported.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old died in Bad Kötzting, Upper Palatinate.
He had laid down on a road the night of Sunday and was overrun by a 42-year-old driver.
According to the police, the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver could no longer brake in time.
At Schönberg (Landkreis Freyung-Grafenau), a 57-year-old biker hit a car frontal in a right-hand curve despite full braking.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, the remaining three people in the car remained unharmed.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavaria's Minister of Transport Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to Gabor Kovacs, the organiser of the Biker protests against driving bans announced for August, the Minister referred to extensive investments such as underrun protection on guardrails and the defusing of dangerous curves.
"In recent years, we have achieved a great deal for the safety of motorcyclists," the letter said.
"The number of motorized two-wheelers killed decreased by around 28 percent compared to 2011".
Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will be guesting with the Hessen, the former club of the Croats, on August 1st (8.00 p.m.).
For the Bundesliga, it is the first and only hard test before the rematch in the Europa League against FC Basel (6 August).
Because of the Coronavirus pandemic, the encounter takes place without spectators.
"We are especially looking forward to this game.
It is always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," explained Kovac.
Sporty is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Prior to joining FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached Hessen from 2016 to 2018 and led to his victory in the DFB Cup.
"A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Eintracht trainer Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croat at Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurters had lost the eight-finals match against Basel in their own stadium with 0:3.
Almost 50 new infections: Landkreis Hof just past the lockdown
In the county of Hof, the number of known new Corona infections increased further on the weekend: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person is recovered and no longer falls into this statistics) to 47 on Sunday.
In addition, there is a case in the city courtyard.
Thus, the Hof area approaches the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.
700 dead due to monsoon rain in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, especially in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
Because of the heavy monsoon rain, a total of 700 people were killed.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent in boats tries to reach the isolated people.
Whole villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Panzernashornen in National Park die by landslides
In Kaziranga National Park several of the 120 tank rhinos died from landslides.
They are protected and considered endangered.
This year, the tides are particularly bad, which scientists attribute to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built homes for 650 displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazar.
Also the enthusiasm in Grenezn remains.
Those who used to have a house were so small and like a hut, often do not want to spend their lives in a large apartment block.
Many homes are empty, but - as the government wants - will soon be occupied by those who have lost their homes due to the floods.
60 new Corona infections in just one day in Vienna

Argentina rejects counter offer of creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"That would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," said a statement.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
Argentina therefore calls on its private creditors to waive part of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country will again face state bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Finally, lenders had called for higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine Government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The last inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
Experts expect economic strength to decline by around ten percent for the current year.
At the end of May, Argentina had not paid US$503 million in interest receivables and had thus slipped into a limited default.
Arrived professionally - not yet privately
"It's going great" - Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws this conclusion after her first days at the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in the middle of May Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notary office.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral lawyer started working, and the normal daily business has long been on full swing.
"However, I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely move the food point from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
Currently, she is looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the district court in Regensburg.
At least her husband was still able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has long been known to her.
When visiting the area with her family in recent months, she once again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her home country of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her apprenticeship period and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several stops as notarassessorin, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also shouldered her doctorate in labour law "by the way" - she took her first position as Notarin in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the job in Eggenfelden had been advertised because of Lutz Feller's approaching retirement, she saw the right time for her full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer has taken over the team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary office in the future - and immediately has a praise for the team of the firm ready: "It works great!"
The fact that she can rely on well-established processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
In terms of kindergarten and cribs, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging trails in the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which has to be adhered to, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators", said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer to the "Tagesspiegel".
Usually the arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games of last season caused by the Corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal audience seats, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the account when these revenues completely break away."
In view of the continuing Corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable side for the time being".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited," explained Cramer.
The Dortmund-based marketing boss praised the BVB professionals for their pay cuts, which should help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their pay cuts have a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-time work."
Tiny Miracles: Early Start into Life with a Few Hundred Grams
Hardly heavier than a packerl butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of around 400 early children who are cared for annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lungs, intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Your skin is sometimes so tender that it could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers specially made for them.
But not so small that they would not be in voice - "and how", smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if they don't scream as loudly as big babies."
When the Whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd just before the holiday began.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the theatre of the city of Aalen presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" to the pupils - and this by video.
Afterwards, the students were able to talk about the play and the performance via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias.
The idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation had been born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was delighted with the enrichment of teaching.
Even if at the end all participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage space would offer additional attractions, the theatre also sees the potential for contact with the schools.
"If we further improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game," emphasized director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: the TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
If the TSV qualified for the DFB Cup in 1860, the lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup have been determined.
The lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt with a successful qualification.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because due to the Corona pandemic the field of participants is not yet complete, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary waiver of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburg Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If second-level players from Würzburg reached the final, sixty-six would already be qualified for the first round of the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be held between 11 and 14 September and thus one week before the third league start.
"Gone from the Wind": film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
The film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died on Sunday in Paris at 104 years of natural death, confirmed her spokesperson for the German Press Agency.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the southern epic "Vom Winde vergeht" (1939).
Born in Tokyo as a child of British parents, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as an infant.
The Austrian theatreman Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of the Hermia of Shakespeare's "Sommernachtstraum".
The film studio Warner Brothers took her under contract for seven years and brought her out at the side of Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".

His son Benjamin was born from his marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946–1953).
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss finale at Comeback
Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they lost 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21) to their national team colleague Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen in the semi-finals.
Most recently Thole/Wickler played last September at the World Tour Final in Rome.
In the final on the Rhine, their rivals Ehlers/Flüggen defeated the surprise team Lukas Pfretchner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretchner/Milan Sievers secured the tickets.
Kalbitz-Rauswurf from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
From the point of view of the FDP, the exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said the FDP domestic politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of trial the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD faction in the Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have long since been excluded," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded does not say anything and does not change anything," he said to the "world on Sunday."
"It speaks rather volumes, how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD."
Blume expects the AfD to land below five percent in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD Landes and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the stress as "secure right-wing extremist striving".
In May, the AfD federal executive had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
He stated that Kalbitz had not indicated an earlier membership in the now banned right-wing extreme "Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and in the Republicans when entering the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing party in the Brandenburger Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
This decision would neither weaken the federal party nor weaken the right wing.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troops is manageable.
One wants to avoid further observation by the constitutional protection and tries to get through under the radar", said Walter.
"The AfD won't get rid of the ghosts it called out.
A kick-out doesn't change anything," commented the Brandenburg SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the faction kept to this day as their right-wing leader".
The legal dispute over the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms provide a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea have fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet announced in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to the grid area of Tennet, have supplied another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind power from the North and Baltic Seas thus reaches 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind crop at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher generation capacity
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have joined the grid in the last twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are currently investing EUR 20 billion in the expansion of offshore grid connections," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot use up their capacity even at sea, but can reach about 40 percent.
The record day this year is 2 January when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.
Kunst "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual framework after the Corona break.
Much more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The band "Defenders of the Universe" provided the musical equivalent on southern Kornhausplatz.
To the north of the gallery was the association "Sandtogether".
Freital: Windbergfest canceled due to Corona
The Windbergfest does not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and - knowing how difficult it is for those involved economically - we have hoped until the last minute", said Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (unaffiliated).
"But in the end, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
If tens of thousands had flowed into the festival grounds and into the tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking could not have been complied with in accordance with the current Coronaschutz Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a folk festival.
Moreover, the organisational and monitoring burden would increase disproportionately many times.
Rumberg comforted on next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg won four victories at four starts this weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also not to be beaten on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the freestyle.
On the 15 year old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly prevailed in the Special against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen on Sunday.
On Saturday on Quantaz, the Germans in the Kür were clearly ahead of their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse, Quantaz, belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first freestyle ever.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago Werth had won all important four competitions.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
Wormser Hochschule continues to go into the air: "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is funding a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities of both the university and the DFS Air Traffic Control Academy are equally utilized.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been studying Air Traffic Management as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students started this year.
The experience of the DFS has been very positive so far, and the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the piloting profession.
"In these times, promotion is not easy for us economically.
However, we are confident that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, cross-professional knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue our good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer."
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the Worms University of Applied Sciences, also underlines this: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's programme in Air Traffic Management."
The trust of Deutsche Flugsicherung is both a motivation and a commitment for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future areas of aviation.
With the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study, the university could set very special highlights and innovative focal points for its students in use for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasizes: "The Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on aviation.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
The A 45 motorway was fully closed on Saturday afternoon towards Aschaffenburg for about 30 minutes, as the rescue helicopter was in operation after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove straight ahead with a Ford at 12.40 p.m. at the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the bend and landed at the guardrail.
Due to the impact, the front airbags triggered, the driver suffered slight injuries on the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient was subsequently flown to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At the moment, however, the police assume that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which suffered damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed.
Heil wants to check other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry back to light.
The law is about to be tightened up.
But are they right - and will they remain so?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to check other sectors in accordance with the now planned strict regulations against maladministration in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against limiting work contracts in general.
After the massive Corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ third-party personnel during slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
To this end, the use of work contract workers and temporary workers shall be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and employee leave if you do not want to completely strangle the economy".
Works contracts, for example, are mandatory for large areas of the craft industry, the construction industry and plant engineering as the basis for their added value to the customer.
"The sins of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts anywhere in the German economy".
Works contracts make sense.
"If an industrial company hires a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work to be unconstitutional in its sector alone.
It could not be explained why cheese portioning and packaging would in future be subject to different labour law than sausages, according to a statement on the draft law, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
A ban would therefore increase the consumer price by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European employees from works contractors worked in the industry, partly 16 hours a day, according to the results of an examination carried out by the NRW Employment Protection Administration.
Often they had no break.
Wage was withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation with the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were bypassed by "tricky constructions".
"Now we need to clean up fundamentally."
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we want to adopt in the Cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher testing rates for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for community accommodation."
The draft presented by the dpa includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Health and Safety Act.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nunnemacher (Greens) believes that more intensive controls are needed.
"I would like us to be able to carry out even more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, including animal transport," said nunmacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more controls would also require more staff.
Three dead in the crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
According to the police, three people died during the crash of an ultralight aircraft on an apartment building in Wesel in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
A child was slightly injured.
Two more people had been saved injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the Wesel circuit control centre.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, according to the police.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were initially not known.
Eviction of Frankfurter Opernplatz to be peaceful
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the eviction of the Opernplatz in the night on Sunday went peacefully.
Finally, a few dozen people stayed on the square, but left it at 1 a.m. before the curfew began.
The police had been in action with numerous officers since the early evening, and a larger police force was on display throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight onwards, there was a ban on entering the Opera Square, where riots had occurred a week ago.
Policemen had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of celebrating people.
At least five officers were injured after police entry, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday had also remained quiet.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday around 1:25 p.m.
She was taken to the Klinikum Kassel.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade searched for possible passengers.
According to the police, the woman was on the Bundesstraße 83 in the direction of her residence Hümme, when her car came off the road from a previously unexplained cause and turned over several times.
In order to save the victims, the fire brigade had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether anyone else was still in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched by the rotary conductor with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered to search for people.
However, the operatives did not find anyone between the tall corn plants.
The severely injured were taken to the hospital in Kassel for further care with the ambulance.
Almost 50 operatives of the fire brigade Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The federal road was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin champion in Italy
Turin - After a redemptive goal of Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world football player made the 36th Scudetto of the club's history perfect with a 2-0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home match against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo hit 1-0 before half time.
With 83 points, Turin won two days before the end of the Serie A season without Sami Khedira, who had been injured for a long time.
Inter Milan is the second in the league, with seven points down.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo hit with the last action after a free kick variant.
The 35-year-old used a play by Miralem Pjanic directly from the penalty room limit with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2:0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
Thus, the bleak, but decisive success was assured.
In the 89th minute, the foulelfmeter attached to the latte was probably only Ronaldo himself with a view to the goal hunter classification.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and momentum changes very slightly," said coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Due to the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to perfect the championship.
Juve finally had the calming lead at the top of the table thanks mainly to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only managed five victories.
It is questionable whether Ronaldo will also become a scorer.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 hits on his account after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of Lazio Rome in Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The current Juve pro Gonzalo Higuaín holds the record in Italy.
The Argentinian scored 36 goals for SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the next title chance awaits the "Old Lady" of Italian football.
Juventus is in the eighth round of the Champions League, but has to make up for a 0-1 break on 7 August against Olympus Lyon in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to gas in countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: last year and the first four months of this year, the police have already registered more than 250 illegal car races in the southwest.
There are no comparable figures for the years before, but the speeders are increasingly making work for the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted in the public prosecutors' offices between Konstanz and Mannheim for illegal races, a year later it was already 252 and in the current year up to the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organised events, as the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtag SPD shows.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they took the run from the police - this is also indicated as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men aged between 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeders caught and asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed and 15 prison sentences have been pronounced since 2018.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before due to the many tragic accidents and trials of past years and reported more frequently, said one ministry spokesman.
The Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with racers. Drivers repeatedly brake traffic there in order to gain space and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 riders on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular race track
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit there is an attempt to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between narrows and  Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and inflated sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers dodge to Germany because of the high penalties for too fast driving and car racing in the neighbouring country to the lawn.
For the SPD, the speed limit should not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would eliminate this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you weren't allowed to travel legally here and there with 200 kilometers per hour and more."
Rivoir holds less of information or image campaigns: "Anyone who ignores all rules in such a way and puts not only his own life at risk, but also the life of other road users, is hardly attainable with reason."
ADAC calls for greater police intervention
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that Raser will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and even tougher controls on the routes concerned.
Not infrequently, the high-touring mass of forces becomes more painful and serious: since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races nationwide, two of them in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
There, two young men are said to have delivered a car race in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, bounced against a garden wall and stayed on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
Twenty-one more people have been injured in the races of the past two years.
However, in the view of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, sharper penalties are not necessary: "Legislative action is not needed to sanction illegal motor vehicle races harder," says the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.
Bluelight of July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snacks
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack bar in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road around 3.40 p.m. and ran towards the snack bar.
There he noticed a man who served drinks at the fridge and then left the snack bar through a previously slammed entrance door.
The perpetrator fled towards the meadows behind the snack bar.
According to the police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit area.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hoodie, black pants and bright shoes.
The police are taking further witness instructions.
Ackermann sprints to victory on the final stage at Sibiu Tour
Radprofi Pascal Ackermann has won his second day on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatinate from Team Bora-hansgrohe prevailed on the 109 km long section with start and finish in Hermannstadt in mass sprint, after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season victories three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall classification, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had decided in the morning the mountain time riding sovereignly for himself and thus took over the top in the classment.
Only 104 riders had taken part in the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountain time trials.
"I'm really happy to start the new season with a win," Ackermann explained after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the finish he simply put on his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly".
In accordance with the rules of the UCI World Association, a Corona test was carried out six days before the start of the race for all race participants and their companions.
During the complete tour, drivers and supervisors were separated from the organisation team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Command gave instructions for lay reanimation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment house, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call arrived shortly before 1:00 p.m.
"A control center dispatcher immediately gave instructions for lay animation," said a fire officer to BILD.
The incoming rescue forces took over the revitalization measures a little later.
The child in danger of life was transported to the university hospital under resuscitation.
Why it happened is unclear.
The police routinely started the accident investigation.
The fire officer: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unauthorized Tuning Meeting - Police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1000 people participated in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to increase control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police in Mittelfranken, an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police at around 10.30 p.m.
As a result, the police carried out a large number of vehicle checks there.
Only recently had the police announced that they wanted to step up their efforts against so-called autoposers.
Illegal Tuning Meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part from the "scene"
The officials counted at the top about 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police account.
However, only a small part of those present were to be attributed to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the scene followed the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on site, it is to be assumed that these were mainly showy.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the current infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on the spot were completed around 1:00 a.m.
A total of 10 vehicles were subjected to such structural changes that the type-approval had lapsed.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
Illegal car races did not exist.
"The Central Franconia Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out reinforced control measures, also in connection with the emergence of spectators," they said.
The agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the towing company involved: "They all have beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," says Schrödinger.
Special ribbons would be used for this purpose.
Also because the cars are wider, the company has to be careful not to make any damage.
"After all, the young people should get their cars back safely."
Employment agency figures: 900 suspected cases of short-time abuse
Berlin - According to the Federal Employment Agency (BA), around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time work pay are investigated.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that reported short-time work," said Daniel Terzenbach, Executive Board member responsible for operational business, of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, many companies suddenly applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the test takes up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time at our disposal in this hot phase.
That's why we're going to take a closer look at the final statements.
I'm sure there'll be a lot of things to do.
We are not naive and have a long breath."
Evidence of abuse often comes from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, BA uses analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more bankruptcies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we arm ourselves in case of the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money".
The figures are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden disbanded
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the Neues Garten.
The collection was dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation informed on PNN request.
The youths would then have left the park.
On Saturday evening, some youths would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by district drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the foundation there are always accumulations, in which the distance and hygiene rules Covid-19-Abgangsverordnung are not complied with.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the Neues Garten.
Even without the Corona Decree, the parks will be closed at nightfall.
The storage on the meadows is prohibited according to the park regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The Foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more and more waste and destroy protected biotopes.
Meanwhile, illegal park parties in Berlin have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party during the night to Sunday.
The event was disbanded by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the regional authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected young interns are in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has also been tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourism workers were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday night.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there and there" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Some guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around a third of the guests are Germans.
On Friday, the first infections had become public.
On Saturday, the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the conduct of the interns who had celebrated in several places and could have infected themselves there.
"We all liked to do this in our youth," he said to the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of Corona spread throughout Europe during the initial phase of the pandemic.
More than 1500 people in Austria are currently infected with the virus.
The focus of the new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
On the last day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured third place with a 2:0 (0:0) victory against the direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because Chelsea FC was still passing and qualified as fourth for the king class as well.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead by a penalty shot by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the postseason, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) hit the final score.
Thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4), Chelsea, who was in the Champions League final opponent of FC Bayern, won in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who passed the Wolves with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the distance duel with Watford FC and Bournemouth AFC, but had to tremble for a long time at West Ham United for class maintenance.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately compensated Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.

Just like Bournemouth, who couldn't save himself with a 3:1 (2:1) at Everton FC.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool FC, which has been the English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points are the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team barely missed the record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) made the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club," said goal scorer van Dijk after the match, "which should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
In the end, the Premier League bosses are also likely to be satisfied.
Because of the Coronavirus crisis, football operations in England had been interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, even an early termination or a performance of the remaining games on neutral ground was discussed.
Finally, the season could be played without any special events - however, as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Netanyahu’s head of government are getting more and more violent.
During the night violent clashes took place.
The Israeli police violently attacked participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative leader Benjamin Netanyahu on the night of Sunday in Jerusalem.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld reported.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to dissolve the rally.
According to media reports, some 6000 people gathered near Netanyahu's headquarters on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns, and called Netanyahu to resign.
The news site "ynet" reported that participants in a counter-demonstration had also been arrested who supported Netanyahu.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private mansion in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv because he was suspected of spraying pepper spray from a moving car on demonstrators on the side of the road.
Another man was arrested after a stabbing attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator had been slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Most recently, Netanyahu was also criticized for handling the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is held up with quick loosenings and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has severely affected the country's economy.
The unemployment rate was more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel recently rose to ever new record levels.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhr - Bild.de
Ahlen - A rear-end accident on Saturday afternoon on the B58 at Ahlen called for nine lightly injured.
A motorist was traveling with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police: "Suddenly she had suddenly slowed down because she wanted to turn."
The driver of a Mercedes transporter driving behind her must have seen it too late.
He hit the back of the car.
In the accident, three passengers in the car and six in the van were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea locks the border town after Corona suspicion
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to ward off coronavirus as a "lightening success".
The country is now reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a big city for fear of disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defence measures in the past six months, the state media reported that "the malignant virus could have been introduced into the country".
The region around the border town of Kaesong was in a state of emergency.
The Communist leadership issued the highest level of alarm.
If the suspicion is confirmed, it would be the first official infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea had not previously reported a single infection and described its defensive measures as a "illuminating success".
The data were questioned abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly found in a "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person had left for South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea of the border crossing within the four-kilometre wide and largely mined military buffer zone.
However, according to reports from the Yonhap National News Agency, South Korea’s military acknowledged the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Investigations were being carried out on some persons.
According to North Korea, an emergency meeting of the Politburo of the Workers' Party chaired by Kim Jong Un was held on Saturday on suspicion.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe."
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure, "to completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others," he continued.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been quarantined.
The central military commission of the party should therefore investigate the "outlier case" as well as the behaviour of the responsible military unit and impose severe punishment if necessary.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension before Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still to be discussed for a big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the committee will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale urban development project in the east," says the central section of the urban press release at the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
However, the appreciation of the eastern city in particular is controversially discussed until the end.
The majorities for this are scarce, most recently even hostile in individual committees, depending on their presence.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed by the administration and municipal council fail now after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as "out-of-parliamentary opposition", "unsuspecting", "speculation", "denigration" and "conscious false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim Citizens' List.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The exit is cheaper for the city, the Technical City Hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after grants, of whose existence Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city would develop quite differently from what was predicted in the town hall and by the supporters from the economy.
Designing the city by its own power and not by an investor: that is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides essentially for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the open-air maintenance of the Schloßberg, the rental of the Ex-Thales for administrative areas and a small-scale city centre remodelling in the ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health-related noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many speed reductions.
In a press release, the German Transport Club welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus in noise, according to the VCD, by neglecting the regular bus traffic with thinned cycles and by little commitment to cycling.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
The agenda also includes the accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the re-fixing of parental contributions in the city day care centres and the application for admission to the federal Smart City funding.
Citizens are welcome, but they must take Corona protection measures into account.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with much delay
With almost half a year of delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his first season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31st.
Before the league of the super sports cars can start the regular operation, the first test runs were now on.
For Zimmermann, it was primarily about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 more closely.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first mission in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargen made his first laps on the Lausitzring and got used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the preseason," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it was really a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Dutchman has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," Zimmermann says.
"Steijn and I get along brilliantly and we have made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also carry out its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lusatia.
But Zimmermann, who is one of 15 serial newcomers, knows the track.
In 2015 he was the last guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafener Renngemeinschaft Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to meet optimally in order to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is then turns out in two weeks.
"The teams are, of course, pokering a little during the tests," he says.
"Finally, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a busy calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current state is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take part in the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister cold caught by quarantine decision
According to press reports, the British government's decision to quarantine Spain holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold.
Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday.
Because of the rise in Corona figures in Spain, the London Cabinet removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine conditions is possible.
The new regime will apply from today, Sunday, so that Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are on leave only on the deadline, only from Saturday, August 1st, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is still considered to be one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Numerous ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility of quarantine for holidaymakers in Spain," said Labour MEP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapps."
Almost one month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the end of the severe curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists mainly blame nightlife for the recent spread.
Spain is one of the British's favourite holiday destinations.
The British Government is currently recommending that non-necessary travel to mainland Spain should be avoided, with the exception of the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular among British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel corona virus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Marine Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on the day of the Navy in his country a equipping of the warships with the most modern hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons, which are unique in the world, the fighting possibilities of the Russian naval forces would be extended, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
The Ministry of Defence also informed Interfax about successful tests of the Zircon hypersonic missile built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of about 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo will continue to be built
It was also said to be built on the atomicly usable underwater torpedo Poseidon.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who also sailed a military boat himself, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service by the individual fleet associations of the largest country in the world.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been protecting Russia reliably, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Also in many other Russian coastal places the naval forces celebrated the day of the navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated at an arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus' strength.
Ammunition was also fired there.
A video published by the Ministry of Defense included not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" Reaches Texas: Help Difficult Due to Corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this season across the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the US state, the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. climate agency NOAA announced in the night to Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared the emergency state for numerous districts.
The Corona pandemic that is rampant in Texas makes the work of the helpers more difficult, Abbott continued, according to the U.S. media.
Evacuated Called to Caution
"Every hurricane is an enormous challenge," said Abbott, according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle".
Looking at the cyclone in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is being exacerbated by the fact that it sweeps through an area that is the most affected by Covid-19 in the state."
According to Johns Hopkins University, approximately 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
They should not disregard practices "that we have become accustomed to," such as wearing masks, said the governor, according to CBS.
It was important that everyone kept their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, emergency shelters should be tested on Corona.
Damage had initially only been reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning taken back
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour, according to the authorities, "Hanna" was hit on the island of Padre Island just off the Texas coast on land.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level one hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning had first been issued and later taken back.
Authorities expected a slowdown, while "Hanna" moved further inland and headed toward the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was heading for Hawaii during the night of Sunday with wind speeds of about 150 kilometres per hour.
However, the hurricane center expected it to weaken further.
According to the prediction, it is supposed to be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average hurricane season this year, according to a May forecast.
Up to ten hurricanes can be expected from June to the end of November, of which up to six could become very strong hurricanes, the agency said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
In view of available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, which of an under-average is only 10 percent, it was said at the time.
US President Donald Trump wrote via Twitter that his government was watching the storms closely and in contact with the states concerned.
Four goals cancelled: video assistant "punishes" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic were denied two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals missed: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a rave black evening at the 0:2 (0:1) SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really mad at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of ungiven goals for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so tough against a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Host Naples had gone through a goal of external defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute in the lead, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic first cheered the balance.
The video assistant referee (VAR) took the hit back due to a side position.
Five minutes later Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - again the VAR intervened.
Also the goals of attackers Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) took back the referee team according to the VAR.
In the postseason, Allan made the 2-0 final for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology creates records", writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern München: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League started with a setback for Doublesieger FC Bayern.
After a short holiday and a few days of training, Hansi Flick "somehow good" has to consider how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of World Champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, behind Captain Manuel Neuer and midfield boss Joshua Kimmich, has the third most minutes of duty, suffered a band injury at the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive king-class duels.
In the Munich Schmuddelwetter the right-wing defender broke off a training game and was driven with a golf kart from the course.
How long the unqualified regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
The 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament, which begins in Lisbon on 12 August, to be played in the eighth-elfinal back match against Chelsea FC on 8 August.
The Bavarians do not want to be stopped by the mishap from the training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are intended to show his victorious title collectors in the 28 days following in the ideal case until the King Class Final on August 23rd.
"We simply mastered the duties with championship and trophy excellently.
Now it's time to create something special," Flick said.
However, until Munich can deal with the final tournament and a training camp in the Algarve, the eight-elfinal challenge against Chelsea will begin.
After the 3-0 in front of the Corona-Pause, the Londoners in the home arena were not to become the Bayern-Albtraum again like in the lost "Finale dahoam" 2012.
"We have to walk through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game," Flick demanded.
A match test will be held on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn in his stars, who had 13 days vacation after the Double, on a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players on Säbener Straße, including the new players around Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the square for the first time after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all the new ones, has been well inserted," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. can no longer just train, Flick would much rather talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, team strength is now being trained for the Londoners, who, in contrast to the Flick ensemble, are in the game rhythm.
After that, Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the finale in Lisbon "is not that easy", emphasized the chief coach, who can trust the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday onwards.
The World Cup record scorer Klose and Flick know of so many common tournament preparation, what is particularly important with the 0 to 100 tuning.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure", Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" was an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with teams of nine was also ambitious on Sunday.
Of the top performers, all were present, including Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts are not secured beyond the king-class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion
Since it is not possible to ride on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise to award the World Cup titles.
However, all America races were cancelled.
Race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula One season continues to take shape.
Three more race tracks were added to the ten previously confirmed Grand Prix during the week.
In October, the race will be held at the Nürburgring in Germany and Portimão in Portugal.
On the first November Lewis Hamilton and Co. fight for World Cup points on the Italian traditional race track in Imola.
This means that the 2020 racing calendar currently comprises 13 races.
"We are pleased to continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the top class of motorsport will be completed in this exceptional season.
The Formula One team wants to finish their season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the races already officially planned in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports have shown up in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulations demands races on three continents
However, the rules of Formula 1 require at least races on three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA intends to award the titles on the basis of "extraordinary circumstances" due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional season start in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the upcoming Corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Refusal meets criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense Corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being with them again next season," said Carey.
The rejection of the American races came up against criticism, especially in Brazil: "The cancellation was not surprising for us, but we cannot accept the reasons," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
The number of infections in the region of São Paulo is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Moreover, the concerns of some teams about not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify rejection.
They were prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad view against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest at Stephen Colbert's famous latenight show via video and revealed in the interview what she had in her mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular US latenight show via video.
Among other things, she told of her struggle against the powerful in the world.
The teenager also talked about her famous "bad look" when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now, in a well-known latenight show, she spoke about her plans for the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish woman.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children goes out on the street" she has experienced.
Heads of state and leading politicians who scoff at them in social media or even try to silence them find them "joyful", as they show the reactions "because they have no other answer to them".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was approached by a well-known scene in which she cast a bitter glance at US President Trump.
At the UN Climate Summit 2019 in New York, for which the nude woman sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive view was captured by the cameras and since then has been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip produced a GIF, i.e. an animated image that eventually became one of the most frequently used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the American president at that moment?
She replied briefly to Stephen Colbert's question, which was relatively open: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the quick answer and disappeared from the picture laughing for a short time.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she remembered many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmund immobile with triple pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe with Bavaria's Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile still has best chances to become goal scorer king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional scored three goals in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two penalty points in the post-seasons of both halves.
As a result, the 30-year-old from the fourth two season games before the end now has 34 goals in his account - just as many were scored by Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening still on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
The blues rock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members announced in an official statement on Saturday that another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in London in 1967.To this day his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the Group's profits for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in broad robes and with great crucifix.
Mental problems are also said to have played a role.
Green left the band three years after its founding in 1970.
A social decline followed.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He was said to have lived on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener, and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working-class family in Bethnal Green, London.
At a young age, he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing the guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to act as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
He was hired by the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media buzz, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green was surprisingly successful in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac swam on a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green didn't make a big comeback until 1996 when he started again with a group of friendly musicians.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke of a rock star who had returned to Earth.
Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group, free of drugs, until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
