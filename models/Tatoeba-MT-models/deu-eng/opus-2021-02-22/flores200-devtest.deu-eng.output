This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely used, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal on the top was chestnut brown and on the underside light or carotenoid.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called Rachis, but have other features of feathers – barbs and barbules – the researchers concluded that the Rachis were probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or heart-owning. The researchers suspected that the sample, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the plumage of an adult, not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and no chick down.
A car bomb detonated yesterday morning in the police headquarters of Gaziantep, killing two police officers and wounding over twenty other people.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the earth and causes the tides, the Milky Way also exerts attraction forces on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists came to the conclusion that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter is located in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

She finished her other race, the giant slalom, with 10th place in the women's group with a combined run time of 4:41.30. Thus she was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes faster than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished ninth.
Four skiers of crutches did not finish, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom could not place themselves in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and secured her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police President Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the defendants had appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car rushed in, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered significant injuries to his head.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
In the meantime, Adekoya was charged with murdering her son before the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody until the indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony may be falsified as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photos potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes: "Journalists seem to cross a dangerous line when you publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the Leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians demand that the borders be reset to the state prior to the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics supposedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley of ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority wants to accept such a presence only for five years.
The protectors of the accompanying pest control experiment should be closely supervised by rangers, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Managing Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training lessons.
Yesterday, Martelly sworn in a new Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP) with nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to direct the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread dissident protests that began in October.
The result of the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
More than 60 cases of overheating in broken iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economic Affairs, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that he was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
"Last week, METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other incidents of overheating that the company described as "not serious."
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office of Civil Protection of the Northern Mariana Islands said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no evidence of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and there have been at least six confirmed deaths so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
He trained as a maternity doctor and began his work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his work at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the use of a hormone accelerated the lung maturation of the foetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two Black Box flight recorders on Wednesday.
Ringer colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman.""
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels made the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as I was ... maybe even crazier ... I love her and will miss her ... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal elections, the proportion of those who object to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the election campaign for the 2010 federal election, temporarily reigning Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the respondents share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of the respondents said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medalist at the Olympic Games was supposed to swim at the Commonwealth Games in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle disciplines as well as in three layer relays, but due to his many complaints his fitness was questioned.
He was not able to take the drugs he needed to overcome his pain, as they are banned from the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of the earth's water supply, along with organic matter, that can make proteins and make life possible.
Since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago, scientists promise insights into how planets, especially the Earth, arise.
Cuomo (53) took up his office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He described the rumours as 'political chatter and silliness'.
It is speculated that he could apply for the office of president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older technology based on ground radar to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional means of transport will be set up and the above-ground trains will not stop in Wembley. There are no parking spaces or park-and-ride facilities available on site.
With the concern for lack of transport possibilities, the likelihood grew that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the fans of the team.
A study published on Thursday in Science reported the emergence of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved within just two generations, although it had previously been assumed that this process lasted much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrated cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metal. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called picture manuscripts, in books called picture manuscripts.
This is called the PH value of a chemical. You can produce an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemicals tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which their electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then mold them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of protective layer.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China there were toilets. In Roman culture toilets were sometimes part of public bath houses that visited men and women in mixed society.
If you call someone thousands of miles away, use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was transported from a rocket into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our gaze somewhat.
It takes a gigantic rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to shoot a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service the wheel has done to us is much easier and faster transport.
It brought us the railroad, the car and many other means of transport.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free stray domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has and that ensures that it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called pack.
The pack consists of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion pack acts similar to wolf or dog pack, animals that are surprisingly similar to the lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior and just as deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump large distances and pull with the five times strength of a strong person.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the full-bodied roar of the lion, but rather like a sentence of growling roaring words.
Ozelots eat small animals. If they can, they capture monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals that the Ozelot hunts are much smaller than he himself.
Scientists think that Ozelote pursue and track down animals for eating (exploitation) with their sense of smell. They sniff at where they have stayed on the ground.
They can see very well in the darkness with night vision and move unnoticed. Ozelots hunt their prey by visually aligning themselves with their surroundings and then fall for their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (e.g. when they move over a mountain range or a river or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adjustments to be a strong competitor than what it used to be.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations then look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen, inhale people, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that people emit (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce their food through the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. We feed mainly on plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the greatest predator of his time, so he was afraid of nothing but other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another set on the palate, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, big fish, other Mosasaurs and was perhaps even a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that came into the water; even a great dinosaur like the T. Rex was not up to him.
While most of their food may be known to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and some kind of rodent called syllables.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, while the rich men preferred to hold joint banquets with them lying on their side while they ate their meals.
Courts of ancient Rome could not contain food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no old Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of God.
Sacrifices were made to the gods, and the priests tried to conform to the will of the gods through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar room, which could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called zikkurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the yard. Shops simply consisted of shop counters open to the street. Stone was used for building houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Old Norse legends say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. As he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But independently of his discovery, Eskimo tribes lived there already at that time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film "The Legacy of the Templar Knights", you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows with certainty who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 293⁄4 inches x 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage at the beginning of his life.
It is therefore possible that the endorsement has simply been added as a label.
The landing at D-Day and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"It was dominated by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them."
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France and the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
After only two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation troops had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is an independent culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state and which also somehow defines the size of a society.
City states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the transfer of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and an appropriate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the revolutionary struggles, the 13 states first formed a weak central government based on the Federal Treaty, which consisted only of Congress.
Congress was not authorized to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, it relied on the federal authorities, which often did not cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
He also had no power to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team together with the German national football team is the second most successful in the world and was FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roll hockey and Formula 1 motor sport.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions and Italians take part in international competitions and Olympic games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
"Due to the cluster/group of islands Japan, Japan is often referred to geographically as "archipel"."
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed there and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a branch in south-western Taiwan, initiating a change in indigenous grain cultivation methods and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat of the First Chinese-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, in which it relinquished sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the room of the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of what they originally looked like.
Until 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu's restoration work was restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world's most widely used still format is 35 mm, which corresponds to the prevailing film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still being produced today, but even more importantly, its image format has been adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Actually, the so-called 35 mm format measures confusingly 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (the GSP format family, for example) have exactly the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
The much-scorned and often mocked third rule is a simple rule that creates dynamism and at the same time preserves a measure of order in a picture.
It says that the intersection point of the lines that delineate an image vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main subject (see example).
In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was put to the test.
For over a thousand years the Christian religion had held the European states together despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizen.
One of the important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that there is the Church's money for this very reason.
The central power of the Church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money caused many to doubt whether this principle was complied with.
Soon after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it cut the country off from vital military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that this blockade violated the generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire seas, which was a threat even to neutral ships.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unreserved submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the experience of the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to join the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the USA with 4 cents in his possession, a book with poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his superior at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method of displaying different ages. Every period of time in China and every family in power was a separate dynasty.
Between the individual dynasties there were also unstable periods of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which took place between the Han and Jin Dynasty for 60 years.
In these times fierce wars raged among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The time of the three kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the highest throne in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could benefit.
The same applies to the military, because instead of being classed, the army rankings were now based on the calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and offers a vivid picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if you know it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above it and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave very little can be seen or heard from this world.
The Cheops Pyramid is the only of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
Built in the third century B.C. by the Egyptians, the Cheops pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to venerate deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or Giza Necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Cheop's wives and family members.
The "Strike" symbol looks like a V and the "Smear" symbol looks like a bracket or a square where the bottom line is missing.
Upward means that you should start at the top and push the bow. Downward means that you start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The painting usually generates a softer sound, while the painting is stronger and more expressive.
You can add your own pencil markers, but remember that the printed sheet markers are there for musical reasons, which is why they should normally be respected.
The panicked King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, her two little children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women in Versailles on 6 October 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming mob of people who were threatening the king and the queen.
The mob forced King and Queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At some point a member of the angry crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the eyes of the horrified queen.
The war expenditures of the U.S. imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of their expenses, and interest on bonds flowed through Wall Street's banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people represented the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the Order.
The epoch in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The high Middle Ages were preceded by the early Middle Ages, followed by the late Middle Ages, which ended by 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand that technology itself has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than social.
It can be said, for example, that passenger cars inevitably involve the development of roads.
However, a national road network is economically unviable for only a small number of cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread car ownership also leads to a higher number of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new health care techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that drew from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that formed individuals. In time, customs and cultures related to this geography arose and these, as they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily enforced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of today's world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the course of the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offer of the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of the fashion capital of the world moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East.
However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that as a result of the Crusades, people began using buttons to fix clothes.
Demand economy is agriculture, which aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, crop that uses preserved seed native to the eco-region and combines it with alternating farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers had subsistence farming, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and enable them to develop an identity feeling.
Subcultures may distinguish themselves from others in terms of age, ethnicity, class, place and/or sex of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical, or a combination of these factors.
The members of a subculture often signal their affiliation by a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse during their childhood.
"Such children are called "wilder" or wild. Some wild children were held captive by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, neglect of the child was due to the inability of parents to accept the child's considerable intellectual or physical limitations."
Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before being exposed or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When completely raised by animals, the wild child shows behaviors (within the scope of its physical possibilities), which are almost completely in accordance with those of its specific foster animal, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, "scaffolding" goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that supports individuals in a new learning situation such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the small paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student alone may not be able to cope with.
Children are accommodated in foster families for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and educational, but many are forced to.
For us, the care facility system is a piece of safety for these children.
Our care family system is intended to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The care centre should cover all the needs they had not received in the home from which they were previously taken out.
The Internet connects elements of mass communication as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of benefits and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialisation" are put forward as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects of Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined the public reactions on websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, a few milliseconds of continuous facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that you can see if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in the facial expression.x
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who can no longer understand language because of brain damage can still properly assess people's honesty.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes them from the pool expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation.
Outside in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system such as the human to meet its need for amino acid from available plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
Overall, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to the chimpanzees in the savannah today.
Sleep underwriting is the process of targeted waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep short time (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you are someone who introduces the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you are forced to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another possibility based on biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid before bedtime (especially water or tea known for its diuretic effect) so that you are forced to stand up to urinate.
The degree of inner calm that a human being possesses correlates in the opposite way with the degree of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the existing life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been extended to include the path of Mahayana's love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini-Yoga, the Kundalini energy (educational energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is the God Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the end of the war, the clash of systems, the course and the culture led to the countries being hostile.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It should last for the next 40 years and, in reality, be carried out by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already completely collapsed and the only hope was a retreat and a repositioning along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army invaded the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created them after entering the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method for the transport of large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains able to transport people and goods while at the same time hindering the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. Americans tried to bring staff and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zāgros Mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to hold them as farm animals to easily get to their milk, fur, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pastures. The goats were supervised by goat herders, very similar to the more well-known sheep herders; often they were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, conveyor tracks were built in England.
Although the conveyor tracks consisted only of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses, who pulled the wagons, to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Thresholds were introduced quite early to secure the position of the rails. However, the realization gradually prevailed that rails carrying a belt made of iron are more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of movement was walking. Two million years ago, man began to walk upright with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning "righteous man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not go up so regularly.
Two-footed species can be found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
In many cases this is just like a symptomatic treatment. However, if you do not only want temporary solutions, then we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity and that the problems due to overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of people have become more serious.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing plant a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known today as 'Dunlap Broadsides'.
The first public reading of the document gave John Nixon in the court of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap wide pages, which still exist, are the oldest still existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that have survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits to use the computer jargon.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that it is not possible to diagnose them immediately.
The best indication of poisoning by swallowing can be the presence of an open container containing medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look on the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term derives from the age-old familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adaptable to parasite people.
Both predatory bugs and bed bugs are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or the habitation of their hosts.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby.
When adopted, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over the parenthood.
The main objective of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. Indeed, this method is the basis of most scientific studies.
However, it is not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that serves to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also conducted by asking questions and carrying out observations.
Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all science issues, including psychology, were recognized.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely based on the presence of the body's own cycles and their production by biological clocks.x
Behaviours specific to a cycle, which are not only reactions to signs of external cycles, are known in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators, which even perform free-vibrating cycles for a time in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey Chase experiment was one of the key indicators that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to incorporate their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked either the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation involved, the importance of the piece of genetic material in question and whether the cells concerned are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is the visit, photography and study of Orangutangs in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial cities by car to drive to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic commuting, all of them are in some way linked to and support a transport system based on private cars.
Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has borne human evolution in the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.x
In developed countries, you will rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such grievances, why do they fail every day? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the two.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, as one cannot predict driver behaviour with 100% safety.
Fortunately, motorists tend to behave reasonably consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain constancy and can be presented mathematically roughly.
In order to better illustrate the flow of traffic, the connections between the three main characteristics were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of infrastructure on the road.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find efficient food and sexual partners.
Most insects can fold back their wings along their bodies.
As a result, they have a wider selection of small shelters where they can hide from predators.
Today dragonflies and day-old flies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the center of the motions of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), was moving around the earth.
This seems reasonable, since it doesn't seem like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It runs more than eight times as much as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes up to six miles wide.
A total of 20 percent of the water flowing into the oceans across the planet’s rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It absorbs water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, who were well over a thousand years old at that time.
The Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since ancient times, as they can all be found in their original form in nature and mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This corresponded more to the four aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also established the theory that they are transformed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are regarded as metals. Of course, there are other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe in its entirety consists of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
As a result, after his invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the pencil has stepped into the background with the emergence of newer writing methods, so that it was pushed back in its status and in its use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to get close to a sharpener.
One may be curious about what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill. If the core is split again, part of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate at little or no thrust.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called a crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearby side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side there could be more Maria, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to ascend to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
These theories deal with what causes certain people to want exactly the things they do and what influences in their environment they cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of need hierarchy and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary measures, carrying out performance assessments, assigning responsibilities and taking employees into account.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and make everything his own.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are run according to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be taken into account by local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
"The "Invisible Team" is the leadership team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.x"
Why would an organisation take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organisation? One goal for the practical implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively through all departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the joint work of an organisation to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to respond to customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. Thus, they narrow down the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, such as traumas, injuries and tumors, affect behavior and cause changes in some brain functions.
New emerging technologies enable us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our heads.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI includes the production of machines for the automation of tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, setting up strategies and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become autonomous disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering and military, and has also been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class. Often, a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus ride is not possible.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum pieces from the classroom, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is rebuilt every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help to improve student writing skills. While students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blog experience, this usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging “also forces students to learn more about the world around them.” The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires students to write wisely and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning far outside the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; through the active response to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' texts and present their own perspectives on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and features a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further to the south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north the untouched beauty of nature spreads in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and others characterize Ontario as what is considered typical Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the US than Canada has citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, as far as wildlife is concerned, its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belonging to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam into the country, and on the Comoros and in Mayotte it was very successful.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama discovered the cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers claim to be married regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (but none that looks too expensive.
Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider an attack, and that it is not unusual to be persecuted, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stay consistent when you reject men, and don't be afraid to defend your point of view (cultural differences back or forth; that doesn't mean it's okay!)
Today Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century before the beginning of the Common Era and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to give it up after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who set up commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the uninteresting places to shop all over Morocco.
Around the old medina it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole spectrum of tinnef are sold, but that's all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the Far East near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any stay outside Gomas should be carefully planned to experience the state of the fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short drive.x
This combined with its relative inaccessibility has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Although Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction and has an airport due to its reputation, it is now an impoverished city.
In 1990 it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most important stations of Louis Gate's PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has an Arab rather than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily protection and entry fees.
It may also be worth buying a wild card that grants access either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name given to the territory of Hong Kong and is the center of attention for many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared to a dazzling bar chart that is visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.x
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and drive to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urbanization is densely crowded on newly acquired land along the north coast.
This is the place the British colonists have chosen. If you are looking for traces of the colonial past of the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world and extend over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining stocks of the mighty jungle that once covered the Gange plain.
The Sundarbans extend over an area of 3,850 km2, of which one third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal king tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the bus station (on the other side of the river) all day long, with most buses, especially those towards the east and Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses between the districts are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are driven by small Japanese coaster buses, which are cozy and stable.x
Collecting taxis offer a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 metres high, its length is 378 metres and it has two lanes with a width of 3.50 metres.
The crossing height below the bridge is 15 metres. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the traffic was not approved until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017. Brazilian customs control points are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that lived in today’s East Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also operated subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of native tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, collecting and fishing.x
Paraguay, formerly called the Greater Province of West India, was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquerors with indigenous indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the establishment of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for its polo team and players among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December on Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be viewed here at other times of the year.x
Information on competitions and points of sale for polo tickets can be found at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is determined in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British Pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and with Stanley credit cards. Also US Dollars are often accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, but British and US currency can be accepted; in advance, ask the owners which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.x
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no marked rainy or dry seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to the sight of humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the Park Authority's instructions, visitors should stay away from at least 100 yards of bears and wolves and 25 yards of all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bisons, wapitis, moose, bears and virtually all big animals can work, it can happen that they are going to attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them enough space.
Also, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking highly fragrant foods, and watch out for a clean stock.
Apia is the capital of Samoa on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 50s of the 18th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of an inglorious naval patt in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except a British cruiser were sunk. Almost 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland stretches over two ports, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe bathing facilities and most offer shade donated by Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, Mission Bay, and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a beautiful shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better tolerated.
You can drink the local tap water without hesitation, but if you are worried, you will also find easily bottled water.
"For Australians, the idea of coffee "Flat White" is strange. A small black person is "Espresso", cappuccino is topped up with cream (not with foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.x
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, observe all signs and pay particular attention to security warnings.
Dice jellyfish occur near the beach and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally occur outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
A booking in advance gives the traveller the certainty that he/she has a place to stay after his/her arrival at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other accommodation forms, such as tents, through a travel agency.x
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
You can also withhold your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g.Visa).
However, any changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to what is happening, you have to go early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that at parts of the festival music is still played until late into the night, even if the music on the main stages has already stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin as breaking ice causes quite terrible noise for the most affected.
The cruises to St Petersburg also offer time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually strive to keep guests on site for as long as possible and to have a lot of money spent. There are usually neither windows nor clocks, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have a special range of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and make sure they stay.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness affects judgment, and all good players realize the importance of being sober.
Those who want to ride in high latitudes or over mountain passes should expect snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads the adhesion is low and you cannot drive as if you are on bare asphalt.
Snow storms can cause so much snow to fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
The visibility may also be affected by falling or floating snow or condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.x
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues for the most part continuously throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari refers to a country trip to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and the standard equipment allows a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy and you can watch them better with binoculars.
A foot safari (also called "bush walk", "walk safari" or "footing") consists of a hike lasting either a few hours or several days.
Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Olympic summer games after being the venue for the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most cancellation policies due to the Coronavirus did not apply until July 2020, for which the Olympic Games were planned.
It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 and 130,000€, an average ticket of about 7,000€.
Ironing damp clothes can help with drying. Many hotels lend iron and ironing board, even if you are not present in the room.
If no iron is available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful that the substance does not get too hot (which can make it shrink or burn in extreme cases).
There are various procedures for cleaning water, some of which prove to be more effective in counteracting certain hazards.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others it must be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers can encounter animal pests that they do not know from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation or, at worst, even cause allergic reactions, administer poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force are usually not classified as vermin.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers with a high level of taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on Highway Buffalo-Pittsburgh is probably the biggest driving challenge, as it often leads through remote, untapped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay mindful: steep gradients, narrow lanes and sharp curves predominate here.
The speed limits indicated are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict compliance is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, however, mobile coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite tasty. In Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, as well as in the southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit biscuits are widely used, with apples being boiled into pastries all year round and cherries and plums used in summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often fit particularly well with a cup of strong coffees.
If you want to produce small but rich pastries, then try what is called Berliner, Pancake or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "humid" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in currys; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a generic concept that includes a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without further attributes, it usually refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread all over the archipelago, offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes. As flavor carriers, the Javanese prefer peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut blossom sugar) and a number of aromatic spices.
stirrups are aids for the feet of the riders, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns, because the rider's feet may be caught in them.
When a rider falls off the horse and catches his foot at the stirrup, he can be dragged along when the horse passes through. To keep this risk as low as possible, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety handles that allow a stirrup belt to fall off the saddle as soon as it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile’s most important climbing destination, known as Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world always discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities for this.
Skiing sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports in which you can attach skis or snowboards to your feet and descend a slope over a snow-covered underground.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes also known as "skiers" who plan their entire holiday around skiing in a certain place.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings with depictions of skiers go back to 5000 BC!
The origins of ski descent as a sport date back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first leisure ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Skiing with backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or skiing.
It resembles alpine touring skiing or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include it, as the latter are carried out in steep terrain and require much firmer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to travel slightly longer distances than when hiking – only very rarely will you reach the speed from cross-country skiing on well-kept trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has numerous independent countries. Normally, you would have to apply for visas several times and pass several passport checks if you want to travel through several countries.
However, the Schengen area works a little like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can normally cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen Member States individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no general definition of which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition includes geographical variations where the age limit may be lower in areas such as North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products could be referred to as 'antique' even though they are younger than similar products from mass production.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture around the trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
Also in the past not all Sámi bred large-scale reindeer animals, but lived on fishing, hunting and the like. Reindeer kept them mainly as migratory animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
"Even though the term "gypsy" is widely used by non-Roma, it is often considered offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma."
If a travel note is issued for the country you are visiting, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of governments other than yours, but their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with situations other than Europeans or Arabs.
Discussions are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and too simplified in comparison to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Severe weather is the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disturbances or loss of human life.
Storms can occur all over the world, and there are different types of storms that depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are the forms and effects of severe weather events, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, water pants and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal storms include blizzards, blizzards, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are urged to pay attention to any type of storm that affects their territory, as this may affect all travel plans.
Anyone who plans to travel to a country that is considered a war zone should do a professional training for it.
"An Internet search for ""course about hostile environments"" will probably show the address of a local company."
One course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning a gender-equalisation operation abroad must ensure that they carry valid identity documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents is also very different.
Security checks have also become much more intrusive after 11 September 2001.
Transgender people before their surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact when the scanners pass.
Crack currents are the returning stream of waves broken on the beach, often in reefs or the like.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper areas and a fast flow up to deep water can form there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue while trying to swim back against the current, which may prove impossible.
When you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you won’t be caught again. Alternatively, depending on your abilities and whether you’ve been noticed, you may have to wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their culture of origin.
When you come home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and abandoned some of the behaviors of your home culture.
When you first travelled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers had to adapt to a new country.
It may not be expected that even returning travelers will need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it's still before the show starts.
Usually you hear the sounds of tourists and sellers. The story of sounds and light is just like a storybook.
The sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, with the different pyramids illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020, sixteen were active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded Caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula, which is bordered by Lake Bellingshausen.
The mountains of the peninsula pass here into the plateau and then rise again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth mountains, which is divided into two sections by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at an altitude of 4892 m.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally no substitute for a mobile phone, as you have to be outside and in clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure ships, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice communications.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about the connection to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off is study and course offers abroad.
This is particularly popular among school graduates, since it allows them to take a year off before the university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participating in a cross-border bridging year program can actually improve your chances of obtaining higher education in your home country.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged for the registration of these educational programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The “land of a thousand lakes” also has thousands of islands – in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
For the archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually large enough for each yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, one in six or eight has a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one in forty).
Most pure Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while you return in the evening and spend the night on the ship.
If you only go ashore during the on-board excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises offer in their brochures Berlin in Germany as a destination. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of every age and area of life, especially if they have never flown or had a traumatic experience behind them.
You don't have to be ashamed of that: it's nothing more than personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
To learn more about the functioning of aircraft and the processes during a flight can help some to overcome the fear associated with the unknown or with the feeling of having no control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery of things. Often time is a very important factor in corporate documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and with smaller companies difficulties occurred.
When they shipped things via air freight, unloading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to ship it as checked baggage, and the airlines' rules don't allow you to ship baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious method of flying in first or business class is to add a big batch of money for the privilege (or, even better, to get your own company to cover the costs).
However, this is not cheap: As a rough rule of thumb, you can expect that you will have to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for the business and eleven times for the first class!
In general, it is pointless to search for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of aircraft that are willing to pay a lot of money and demand corresponding prices for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and conveniently.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinau. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova have been restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is the Orthodox Christian religion.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good traffic hub.
The former ancient town of Smyrna is now a modern, progressive and bustling business center, located on a huge bay surrounded by mountains.
The broad boulevards, glazed buildings and modern shopping centres are characterized by classic red tile roofs, the 18th century market, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city radiates more an atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons over some graves.
It is worth a half hour strolling through the fascinating village.
In the north and in the immediate vicinity lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron had described its splendor in bright colors.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly via Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
Visit the Great Shrine of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima in the north as well – a place that is world famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are basically visiting a mass burial site and a place that has an almost immeasurable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who have survived their time here, and many more with relatives who were murdered there or worked to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, reverence and respect it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not spoil the site by attaching or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only given in Catalan, as it is legally defined as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Normal announcements are made in the metro exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be egocentric, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often just an incorrect cliché, it is best to find your way around Paris if you show yourself at your best and behave like someone who is "been élevé" (well-educated), which will make it much easier to get along.
The bare exterior of the Parisians disappears very quickly when you show basic manners.
The Plitwitz Lakes National Park is heavily wooded, there are mainly beech, spruce and fir trees and it offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, different soils and alternating altitudes, it has a remarkably large variety of plant societies.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and auer chickens as well as many generally more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that extend over their knees and also cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries there are wrap skirts for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or the nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that extend over their knees.
Also these can be borrowed from the inventory at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. For all men there is a unit size!
Majorcan cuisine, like those in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any ingredients just available such as cheese, tuna, etc.
"All nouns start next to the word you use for "you" always with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence."
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult, because you have to determine whether a tuning word or property word is used as the main word.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies according to the following vowel.
"Make sure you also say r and rr differently: caro means "love", whereas carro means "brittwagen"."
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand formulations.
Of course, speaking a Romance language makes it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a little Spanish might prematurely come to the conclusion that Portuguese is so similar that you don't have to learn it extra.
Premodern observatories are no longer normally in operation today and serve as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution during its high phase was not the problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or on university grounds that are easier to reach than those built in recent times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as Hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where plum blossoms represented the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the nobility in the vicinity of the imperial court.
"Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove "only one" specimen."
If one visits a formal garden and collects "samples", one is also thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where you can find your way around and buy almost everything after arrival.
Since you are in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, you have to reckon with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, rarer).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not only to the nearby Jewish settlement Kirjat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
For example, visits to the castle in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They are also popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the festival have been taken over by non - believers in Christian and non - Christian lands all over the world.
There is a tradition of spending the Easter night awake at some open spot to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening, during the Easter weekend, with the celebrations of the congregations often beginning at midnight, where the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or inundating.
Because of the distance from the continent, mammals were unable to embark on the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first humans entered the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the northern light, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese working culture is more hierarchical and more formal than what Westerners might be used to.
Suits are common business clothing and colleagues address themselves with their surnames or job descriptions.
Workplace harmony is crucial, with focus on group performance rather than praise for individual performance.
Often workers have to obtain the consent of their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to comply unconditionally with the instructions of their bosses.
