Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting will also focus on the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticises Israel's ongoing settlement building and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
The deal with Iranâ€™s nuclear program, which Obama has advertised, has further worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech to the U.S. Congress, some of which was considered an affront to Obama.
The speech was not discussed with Obama, who had rejected a meeting with reference to the election in Israel at the time.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a somewhat timid voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" is still alive and probably excited, and he said that the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her cell phone.
Inside the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This was stated by the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no evidence that Lamb, who was teaching two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds, where, according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said that Lamb made the fatal distress call sometime after that.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police encircled him.
The day after the shooting in the university, which forced students and lecturers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped draw a picture of a talented but perhaps difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching staff includes 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies towards problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he was dealing with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying that he had some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the doctorate, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic way to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's performance."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After escaping from campus, the police later found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parental home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coronar Methel Johnson said.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his Ph.D. in pedagogy in spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who spent a few years trying to teach her how to play guitar.
He was then the swarm of women.
All the girls melted away when he was there," Hairston said, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the distress call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer fair three years ago.
Later they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5th for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a sparse audience.
There was no evidence that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, headed the first-semester seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including lecturers, staff, students, and community members, attended a candlelight memorial ceremony on Tuesday evening.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the vigil, while the university choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that in his emergency call, Lamm described Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says that it will not hire as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it planned to employ 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country. In the 2014 Christmas season, 45,000 workers were hired.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will start with job interviews and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and I'm beginning to realize that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated yawn and an arm length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," Spielberg said, "undisputably the biggest time travel movie ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the almost five-year-long conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - on the margins of the General Assembly ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation unsolvable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they demonstrated in addressing the crisis in Syria in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 polls that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn't (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump lead in double digits, and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomination of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the parliamentary term.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain at that time in 2011, none of which won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's stamina and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some recent survey figures that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey by the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures remain in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of ten say they would be "annoyed" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "unsatisfied" or "annoyed" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, became the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Irish voters who tend to be Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temper for a president, ABC News/Washington Post said on Monday.
The same figure applies in the nation's first primary state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to carry out his office effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, ABC/Post says.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who would most likely win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a large number of GOP voters regard Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey by the Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say that they have formed their opinion.
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have given their votes firmly.
Of course, much can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change their mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been the focal point of public discourse on 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic expression will keep key Hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation efforts.
But according to the new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump seems to be doing the same.
The frustration about the government is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, mainly due to their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new ABC/Post Monday survey that they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also mad at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa republicans are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "hellishly angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Bookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Seawatt.
In the street, one square meter of a thatched roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"The supply of objects is naturally limited to Sylt," says the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations one square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student booth in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top residential locations, however, the price is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & VÃ¶lkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices at dizzying heights.
There are sometimes tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter, mind you.
But well, who can afford it ...
By the way: Munich, for once, is not at the top.
Champions League: Bavarian dream start thanks to MÃ¼ller and GÃ¶tze
Double goal scorer in Piraeus: Bavarian star Thomas MÃ¼ller simply has a run.
A lucky hit by Thomas MÃ¼ller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it went.
A sovereign prelude to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas MÃ¼ller and Mario GÃ¶tze have given FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in Piraeus' cauldron.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to MÃ¼ller's double pack (52/90.+2) and GÃ¶tze's score (89.) earned 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start success in series is to be the first step towards the finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola wants to finally bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third attempt.
In his 28th match in the Champions League for the Bayern lead, MÃ¼ller was kindly assisted by Olympiakos goaltender Roberto, who let a shot of the world champion, thought to be flanked, pass.
"We won't underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised hot-blooded fans before the match at the Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without shimmering.
Piraeus had won his most recent six home games in the royal class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, AtlÃ©tico Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1:3).
But the Bavarians, undefeated in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They responded courageously, but often too inconspicuous in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by shifting the game to Douglas Costa, who rarely passed through the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
MÃ¼ller had more luck from the right when his flank from the right half field hit the upper left tore.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave the possible 2-0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunities in half one.
First, when Olympiakos stormer Ideye Brown struck the Pole's headball off the line (26.).
Then by direct acceptance, the goalkeeper Roberto parried with his knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians played their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to put needle stitches.
But goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was dependable.
For example, when he directed a shot of Ideye over the latte (56.).
Prior to the new, Guardiola had a chain of four with David Alaba defend in the center next to Jerome Boateng, which did it well.
Mario GÃ¶tze, after muscular problems back in the squad, first sat outside.
The World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training, said sports executive Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "If you want to make something else out of it, this is already malicious".
Guardiola also decided against him in the first change when he brought Kingsley Coman to Lewandowski (59th).
GÃ¶tze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made it all right 13 minutes later, by penalty MÃ¼ller put another one on it.
Before the match, riots had occurred in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly masked Bayern fans apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures in their audience block, the security forces intervened and proceeded with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bavarian fan was transported injured from the stadium.
Smoking has a higher risk of losing teeth
If you smoke, it not only harms your lungs, but also your teeth - this is suggested by a long-term Potsdam study.
The good news is that if you give up, the risk will decrease quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is evident from the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Human Nutrition (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely by 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The DIfE stresses that the main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums.
For this periodontitis smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent inflammation of the gums in smokers.
It is unclear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
However, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research" that people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time.
However, it could take more than ten years for the threat to return to the level of non-smokers, first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham, England, explained.
People must be persuaded to become non-smokers, said study director Heiner Boeing from DIfE: "Smoking shortens the lifetime."
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health up to old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE reported.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remnants from late antiquity on the banks of the Rhine in Cologne
Archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne again.
Near the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists from the Roman-Germanic Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called soil monuments.
In all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always involved as a specialist office for the preservation of archaeological monuments.
In the third construction phase of the Rhine boulevard the archaeologists now found what they were looking for.
It had already been known from text documents that a fortress stood on the site in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman covered by freight train
After an accident at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police asks the population for help.
At about 1.40 a.m. on early Wednesday morning, the woman crossed the tracks from the direction of the station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of MÃ¶nchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, she sustained the most serious injuries by capturing the train.
She was given emergency medical treatment on the spot and was taken to a hospital by rescue workers.
The investigators have no information on the reason for the young woman crossing the track at night.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passersby of Linderner Bahn, ZiegelbÃ¤ckerweg, ThomashofstraÃŸe and Leiffarther StraÃŸe (L364) are eligible.
Information on the cause of the accident can be provided on the telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police station, which is connected 24 hours a day and free of charge to the Federal Police.
Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
The EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system to resolve the dispute over the planned TTIP transatlantic free trade agreement.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system which, in its operation, corresponds to much more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m at the presentation.
The Swedish Government intends to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the world's largest free trade area with 800 million people.
The plans for reforming current arbitration procedures specifically provide for the EU and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come equally from the EU, the US and third countries.
For the first time, a second instance is also envisaged.
It would allow an appeal to be lodged against judgments.
To date, the parties to the proceedings have agreed among themselves on arbitrators, and there has been no possibility of opposing their judgments.
In the discussion of recent months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, commented MalmstrÃ¶m.
In the long term, it wants to work towards an international investment court.
For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be resolved there.
The investor-state arbitration proceedings (ISDS), in particular required by large corporations, are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional arbitration tribunals are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies can obtain compensation at the expense of taxpayers, undermine national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact identified the proposals of the European Commission as insufficient.
The main criticism was that they should not apply to the FTA with Canada (Ceta), which has already been negotiated.
The German Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as great progress.
In the reform, the Commission took into account key points that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel had drawn up with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed MalmstrÃ¶m's plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the business community's opportunities for action through too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged, they said.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) agreement could be concluded remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been under way since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should already be in place at the end of this year.
This date is no longer valid.
Delicate folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Prime Club in Cologne (now Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart, on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Steven's lecture.
He talks about various places that he always records on the map, about which his meticulously and delicately arranged songs report.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his home country.
Since then, Stevens has turned out to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
With the 2003 and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs appear, which are harmoniously very close to American folk of the late 1960s, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
The rumor arises that "Michigan" would be the first part of a daring series: each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine "Seven Swans" has appeared and breaks certain expectations.
Reduced, Stevens appears here.
Live is enough for him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
In 2005, "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") is a celebrated masterpiece.
Excessive of ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American billboard charts and is not missing in any year's best list of influential music media.
After very productive experiments, Stevens then uses very extensive electronic offsets on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth decent studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and reverberation.
Long since the smaller clubs emerged, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle made of neon ribbons and large fluorescent stage decoration.
Currently Sufjan Stevens is touring Germany as part of a five-member band.
In the dark Hamburg More!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell", which has been available since March.
Although now almost 2000 guests sit banished in their chairs, the much more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience one hears: The lecture is "opulent" and one can basically throw away the "plate".
Only to an encore does Stevens thank you modestly, plays acoustically few older songs and finally bows down with roaring applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Mr Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
The new Labour chairman Jeremy Corbyn is scheduled to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and will be competing with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance probably being examined by the media and the Labour deputies from close quarters.
He demanded "less theater and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, as it will come after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Chairman's decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the National Anthem's singing ceremony for the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he had stood "in respectful silence" and he recognized the "herodom of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, drawing on differences in economics, defense, and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stacking" within Labour, following Mr Corbyn's comments on the position on the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is making changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow labor and pension minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit from Â£26,000 to Â£23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman to face David Cameron, since he's been Tory's boss, over the last decade over the dispatch box in Parliament.
The Labour Chairman, who promised a different policy approach, said he had crowd-sourced ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and more than 30,000 suggestions were given to him.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both "beating" and fighting with barbs and instead intends to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economic minister, will represent him if he does not participate - for example, when Mr Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also brought up the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the floor and that he had raised John Berkow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to get away from politics in the style of a "casperle theater" which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important barometer of the verdict of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics argued that it had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Found in Joburg': homeless young people trained to be photographers
Johannesburg city centre is a tough place when you're homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound increases due to accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound rose in leaps and bounds according to data indicating an increase in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was increased by the bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July, net earnings excluding bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same period in the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest and most accurate estimate of the timing of an increase in interest rates since 2009.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and had climbed to â‚¬1.3730 to 0.84% against the euro.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20% jump after taking over of rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher for Richemont after encouraging news from the competitor group.
Richemont's latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - reported growth again.
Glencore's shares increased by 5% after the mining giant said it had taken $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of Mondi, the packaging and paper group, were the biggest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had "selled" his rating for the company Rating.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages are jeopardising expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs at his company, he says.
The costs could meet JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, megastar.
Lappish 21 years young, a hanfling with oberschicker Frise.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More than that.
Mr. Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is freaking out.
Like Viktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Don't worry.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Polish has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber Building: This is where her idol, whose posters hang in Szczecin, has lived since Monday evening.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs exactly as much a day as her mama Ewa earns in half a year.
If anything.
She says, "Actually, my Viktoria would have to be in the tenth grade in high school."
"I'm fulfilling her dream."
Compulsory school?
Who cares?
The fans don't.
Bieber himself doesn't.
He took care of it anyway.
For the advertisement during the advertising break of the Superbowl, he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company flushed many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter, Bieber also collects.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're amazed at the window pane.
He's said to have captured more than 100 million.
Some say the hype goes too far.
Others point out that Bieber is in first place in the United States and the United Kingdom with his new single "What do you mean?".
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros.
At least he's pretending.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese to potato douner idea
Potatoes or doners?
Both are possible - in the potato dÃ¶ner developed by the Oldenburg snack owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the saying "potato instead of doner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay has put potato and meat together on a spear.
The idea was inspired by a poster in a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of doners", which he had seen by chance on television.
Since then, a barbeque skewer, stocked with meat and potatoes, has been spinning in his shop.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," Alhay says.
In the meantime, the Lebanese has registered the idea with the patent office in Munich.
According to the Authority, it has recently been protected there as utility models.
Therefore, Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and potatoes the skewer contains.
Only so much: "It tastes even better together," he says.
The culinary understanding of the international community is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches ground-based campaign to combat Aldi invasion
Metcash tries to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Grocery wholesalers Metcash has launched a grounding campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media, as well as events as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice cream manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and shop owners selling discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the wholesaler of food, alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investor strategy day.
Much is at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after the opening of its first markets, Aldi will take off around five percent of the food market in these two states and will take off all existing players, but mainly self-employed retailers.
According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time Metcash loses market shares in the eastern states, mainly Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, senior fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglas's comments.
But it's assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenues from Metcash's food and food trade, which supplies approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational debt reduction combined with pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler defends itself and invests more than $150 million to match selling prices with Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products every week and improve IGA retailers to improve their stores through faster growing fresh food and deliver a better choice of private label foods.
Metcash's chief executive, Ian Morrice, says that the price adjustments and shop renovation programs are going to grow and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who is often referred to as "Special Ks", came into the spotlight with the notorious confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison exclaiming, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket after a cramp thwarted a potential US open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm quite excited about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi got a little involved in the argument," said Healy.
He broke a racquet when he lost to a cramp in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break a racquet of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too hard.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the locker room, he's training hard, he's in good shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term fixed component."
"First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I think that Nick made the climb very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think it is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared the state of emergency and blocked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained all those who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no man's land and Serbian officials reacted with indignation.
For an unknown time, the people who had fled violence were stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police.
Some rejected food and water for protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister said it was "unacceptable" to send migrants back from Hungary, while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
Talks will have to take place with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came one day after the 28-nation bloc at a controversial meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in surprised Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that an agreement would finally be reached - next month or by the end of the year - that the EU countries would take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
On Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency announced on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, enabling them to block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it has finished a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and an entry point into the European Union.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most arriving economic refugees are looking for a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force in Hungary at midnight make crossing the border or damaging the 4-metre (13-foot) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also impose higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovac's reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree procedurally to the military deployment expected for next week, but reporters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, state security advisor to Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, after a barbed wire train to close the borders had arrived.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and squeezed a crowd to push themselves into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead ahead of Bernie Sanders halved in national poll
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the democratic race for nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent earlier), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of the Democratic voters in the primary elections.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is clear as to which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey, Clinton has lost in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moderates, but these advances have diminished.
Their support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind.
Clintonâ€™s advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and they and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead with the older voters.
Last month Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in this group.
About half of the Democratic voters in the country's primary elections say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support her only because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clintonâ€™s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of the Democratic voters in the primaries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say so about their top candidate Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it's time that a woman becomes president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clintonâ€™s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to the handling of the problems and the selectability are also cited.
As the vice president throws a potential for the presidency into the balance, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the primary would like to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not.
When democratic voters of the primary elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the head.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say that Biden is their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that regards him as the "most selectable" has increased.
Nevertheless, when it comes to what is more important for a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about eligibility.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the primaries stands out as unacceptable.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results on some of the key features of voters in their party's primary elections.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best off with honesty on the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is the leader.
Thirty percent of democratic voters don't believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have an opinion of him.
Democratic voters of the primaries generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
With all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and a server continue to be asked during her tenure as Secretary of State, most Democratic voters in the primary elections are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions overall.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this issue was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general views of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion of her had worsened.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six out of ten, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party, this remains a problem for them among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country also see Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good leadership grades.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush are best placed to be honest.
A majority see Sanders as being honest, but like Carson, many people don't have an opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson gets close to Donald Trump in a nationwide poll
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
The two candidates now account for half of the voter support in the new poll, and others are dramatically losing ground.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers across the country. Support grows by 23% in the last CBS survey conducted prior to Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is well received by demographic groups and surpasses Trump with higher education among Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been cut off with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the deepest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The error margin in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week shows that Carson is rising in the polls - he lands with 19% support from Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a carson rising last week, Trump found some side-slashes for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathers to find warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some do not go into the sea anymore: The water in the North and Baltic Seas has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) informs.
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic there are in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood burdened with the death of a Baruch college newcomer
Almost two years after a student died during a vicious ritual of a student association in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police reported.
Officials said he was blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked as he tried to approach a target via a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng passed out and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and basically put the welfare of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted with blunt force injuries to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families were destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student has died of harassment every year since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County Grand Jury recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with harassment and the formation of a criminal organization.
"We not only want to hold the people involved responsible, but if there is an organisation that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will also hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation to the local group.
This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
An increase in interest rates is coming, and the booze will be shaken, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance for the economy.
A recession occurred within just 11 months of the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, representatives of the U.S. central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start raising interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the excitement of an interest rate hike may have been exaggerated.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "cheap money," said Julian Jessop, Chief Economist at Capital Economics, in a statement to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still to be too low to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a historical trend-based look at how some areas of the economy might respond:
As the market has seen last month, anticipating interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for asset income to be stalled 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after Fed interest rate hikes.
More specifically, in the past 35 years, the market has mostly been on an upward trend - around 14 percent - on its way to raising interest rates, fairly flat in the 250 days thereafter (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return of 14.4 percent over the past six past cycles according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, Chief Investment Stratege at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate increases often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
What is most remarkable here is that gross domestic product will be near its lowest point when the Fed raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, with the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, nominal GDP has only been below 4.5 percent twice.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate hikes with such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question "whether it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have been prepared for a Fed rate hike throughout the year, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the futures trade only indicates a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all the increment cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super cycle with increasing GDP momentum and put pre-recession levels in the shade very quickly after the start of recovery," the report says.
By contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has waited for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and so far this is 74 months.
Fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic price.
In the case of bonds, returns seem to change direction once the first increase/decrease in the cycle is made.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bond yields fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to yields between longer and shorter bonds coming closer together and leading to a flattening of the curve.
High-yield bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher returns," said Kathy Jones, Fixed Income Analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have expanded, and volatility has increased â€“ all features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large, companies that handle the greater part of their US business will benefit from rising interest rates and making local products more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market, as well as the financing of their debt.
"History shows that "quality" stocks tend to respond very positively three months after an initial rate hike," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have outperformed firms with a weak balance sheet on average by 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 percentage points each and 3 percentage points each.
Debt will be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits from higher returns, even if experts disagree on how fast this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the station for its "dump"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits
Parliament colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claims a leading MP and increases new pressure on the station to prove that it is doing something that private broadcasters do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public-law radio station was "dumb" and increasingly no longer distinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems -- I don't like to use the word "dumb" -- but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be The Brits only under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something else -- these are two spontaneous examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director General dismissed the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it came to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I won't learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music making that is truly unsurpassed.
"And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works is really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that work must be done harder to engage the audience than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of the BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport to kick commercial rivals on their feet.
Tory Member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of Â£22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "on a special BBC way".
He added that he would like the company to "find a hit from our in-house stable" next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money on fee payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose most slowly in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was an increase of seven percent in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago through the use of mobile phones to shop
Experts believe that Black Friday has slowed down spending in November
Virtual shopping has boomed for over a decade, and many of Britainâ€™s major shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnat after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and decline until 2000, this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the Guardian's IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when buyers started shopping with their phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, e.g. at home on the sofa.
But now this is coming to an end, and we may see that growth is diminishing.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers flocked around their computers to make their bargains, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought for bargains, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of Â£5 issues, just over Â£1 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in a crane accident in Mecca - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first burials in Mecca
Saudi Arabia is partially burdening the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
The Ministry of Health also said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed on Mecca's large mosque.
The mourners, dressed largely in white, filled the route to pay their respects when the first of the dead began their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The funeral procession passed by the Holy Place, where only days before a building crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the praying people.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the Bin Laden family construction company for the disaster that also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 praying men who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead were Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly agreed that the Hajj will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said the Bin Laden group shouldn't have left the arm of the crane when it wasn't used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi State Press Agency, said that the Bin Laden Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not report this detail, but said that the company's management was forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that plunged into a courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Hajj, which will take place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the breakdown of the crane, and its representatives have not been available for comments.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for not up-to-date security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's large mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people were staying in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials (Â£174,000) be paid to the families of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European artisans is over
British increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has gone up
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at craftsmen will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons lay down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes
If you can skillfully handle a hammer or brush to paint walls, you seem to be a minority nowadays.
Because Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to do DIY jobs in their homes, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
VÃ©ronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the DIY chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at the lowest prices has now become obsolete.
Kingfisher is therefore planning to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops because eight out of ten shop decisions are made by women.
At the moment, the men predominate among the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said, "There's still a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to shift this more towards a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions about the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a UK leading company listed in the FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and CFO.
Mrs Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our board of directors.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profit and sales after the Group shouldered the cost of closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
On Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball champion Aich/Dob were held responsible for infidelity and tax evasion at the Klagenfurt Regional Court.
The defendants did not plead guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was legally acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been adjourned.
According to Attorney General Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation showed that between 2006 and 2011 the defendants used funds from association accounts over which they were allowed to dispose in their functions for private purposes.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial offenses.
This fact was dismissed by the chairwoman of the Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later stage.
In order to dispel the infidelity, the defence stated that the club had never suffered a financial disadvantage at any time.
The sports officials would only have offset expenses and the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they would have invested a lot of time and money, would have outsourced the debts - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600,000 Schilling (about 44,000 euros).
"At that time we were faced with the situation: do we continue running the club or do we lock it up?" one of the accused, in the bread trade, told large-scale auditors of the tax office.
He then decided, together with his colleague and co-defendant, to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We advanced money, put our life insurances down at the bank as security," he said at the hearing.
The association had been agreed: you can manage the money freely, only no debts may be made.
Furthermore, the payment of the expenses compensation had been decided retroactively until 1991 if the corresponding financial success had been achieved.
Therefore, some of the expenses were paid only years later, i.e. from 2003, when a plus had been in the account.
Therefore, flat-rate and not detailed deductions appeared, the former chairman explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books jointly administered the two defendants, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payouts had not been disclosed to the club in detail.
The association was not interested in the details of the financial arrangements, but only the debt-free arrangement was important, according to the answer.
In 2011, when an official began investigations into abuse of office, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club account.
These were reserves, the defendants explained.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association according to his statement.
"Why?" the judge asked.
For a long time, the respondent did not know an answer.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known about this money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The co-defendant was informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "damage compensation".
Why compensation?, judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant then declared that he disagreed with this wording because the association had never suffered damage.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "You're all out of line with him."
"Am I a lawyer?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he had never received a cent salary, he had only offset mileage and diets.
He had charged the club 1,000 euros per month for diets, but the actual effort had been much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to provide exact documents for the early years.
They stated that they had not been kept after an audit in which everything had been judged to be correct.
Kilometer money had also been received by the second defendant.
He explained in his statement that all the corrections had been made in cash, and that he had had to drive from his home in VÃ¶lkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg.
The main hearing will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard strokes another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the staff reduction that has been going on for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs in the division of the company.
The strokes of the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) find no end.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate business division.
The company announced on Tuesday that this will save 2.7 billion dollars (2.4 billion euros) in costs.
The move will result in a special burden of around 2.7 billion dollars, which will start in the fourth quarter.
The removal of 55,000 jobs, which has been ongoing for three years, has not yet been completed.
HP still had around 302,000 employees at the end of the 2013/14 financial year.
The Hewlett-Packard share fell 2.3 percent on the stock exchange.
The company, which grew up with printers, is currently split up from Palo Alto in California: for example, the computer and printer business is to be bundled in a new company this year - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A once again disappointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services have recently increased to the world's second largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third quarter at the end of July, sales of PCs and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to nearly $25.4 billion.
Revenues thus declined in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive job cuts to the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, only reacted late to customers increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide for a total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority supports the anti-IS training mission
A direct participation of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq would, however, be overwhelmingly rejected: 54 percent opposed it, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states fly air strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is positive for 61 percent.
24 percent are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would be in favour.
29 percent couldn't make up their minds.
Car: Second Press Day at the 66th IAA
The exhibition will focus on connected, self-driving cars as well as electromobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show on Thursday under the motto "Mobility connects".
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday onwards.
As two years ago, the organisers of the Auto-Verband VDA expect about 900,000 visitors.
RÃ¶szke: Outbreak of violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police deployed tear gas and water cannons at the Serbian border against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent DÃ¡niel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
Behind it a police line had formed and behind the police there was a water cannon.
Between 40 and 50 refugees started throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officials first used pepper spray continuously.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
The group was dissolved.
The refugees have now withdrawn a bit.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees gathered together and suffered from shortness of breath.
The press officers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world observes when the US Federal Reserve meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest rates will be raised for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half, who last week believed the Fed would do this, now thinks the Fed will stay a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed put interest on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance level, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances of such a move are good.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday
Deathshooter at Delta State University left behind letters of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "suffering" in the first murder and wanted "to undo it," authorities announced Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called 911 at 10:00 on Monday morning.
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the 911 officer that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house, but "nobody will disturb", but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman that ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's performance."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities on Tuesday said there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship."
Prentiss was described as a "good man" by Shawn O'Steen, who testified that they had been married for about seven years.
They were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19, and she was "destructed."
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had been seeing Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles.
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them, "He's not going to jail."
When police caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to his side, fled on foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with one shot.
Lamb received a Ph.D. from Delta State University in spring 2015, according to his life's mood on the University's website.
Stars who have lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor is also said to be struggling with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of possession of drugs.
I'm sure all this is taking its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa rebuilds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major restructuring of the Group.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation alone.
150 of the world's approximately 1000 executives will cost the company's job.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is transforming its corporate structure and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment was to contribute around 500 million euros per year to earnings from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for passenger business in the future.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the management team led by Chief Carsten Spohr.
With the repositioning, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000-strong company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective bargaining conflict with the Cockpit pilots' association (VC), negotiations are to be resumed this Thursday after the judicially stopped strike.
That's what the union said.
Discussions will focus on the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as soon as possible "in a year with a predicted record result".
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots, the background is the savings concept "Wings".
It provides that Lufthansa will outsource routes to the Group's own low-cost Eurowings in the fight against competitors.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left defender cry and will rule him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by HÃ©ctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double leg fracture and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has a very hard time and then plays fantastically, and then that happens.
He had an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet in Shaw's account said, "Thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my way to recovery starts now, I'm coming back stronger."
Referred to this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in defeating PSV
With the European Championship in France, the defender of England has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player with this type of injury leaves the place, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was heading in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry.
The PSV player AndrÃ©s Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
It is one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not take long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you might be David Cameron.
When asked by a childcare provider to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, the 1971 published environmental fable by Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative, and with a powerful message, it's a book I like to read to my children because there always seems to be a picture or message that we've missed so far."
All fine and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a summary of the film version of 2012, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"Amidst the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. One love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seus's hostage and who died in 1991 but was completely unknown.
As if that were not suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website and starts like this: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book. Here an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is devastated by the money-hungry, tree-cutting, thneed-knitting Once-ler despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a squatting, purr-bearding being "who speaks in the name of the trees".
Most likely such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A downing street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, but did not make any further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
To encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the squad that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook's site may be less experienced than that three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setup, and the community spirit is strong; they won't wear scars from 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it is an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Message related to this: Adam Lyth quits the England Test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to skip Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyze.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination because - and I said this earlier - players are their own best pickers.
A long time ago, the course of Lyth would have been extended, but he had control over his own fate.
I hope he'll make more runs for Yorkshire, and there'll be another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he didn't perform so well, and that doesn't surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test man gets to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only accusation one can make was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance now lies in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and he's a batter I highly appreciate.
He is an X-factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which hit us a lot.
He must have at least the same chances as those before him, but this naturally depends on the team line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beat next to Cook, which would provide an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, turned up, and I don't mind.
I don't see why a batter can't beat there, and this left-handed guy has already shown that he's a devil of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his county Worcestershire, but he's a number three for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He did three hundred runs right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the cadre as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People might look at his statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there are no large number of backup spiders that raise their hands and the coaches have chosen youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some smart additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as advisor for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys of the game who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices in the changing room can bring a fresh breeze, even if the news is in line with what has been said.
Coly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, won't be in the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I for my part don't have a problem with it.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team leaders will not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that, as with players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made lightly.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could gain momentum if the economy slows down by 2017
David Cameron's unextriced renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is going to get deeper into trouble with every day, even without the choice of the ingenious Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn as Labour's leader or the TUC, who fought violently for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is and not always of their own fault, are fed up with Britain's own agenda of divided concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they usually don't want.
In Brighton, TUC decided at its annual meeting that it would not like them to endanger social protection either.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants an outside-looking UK inside the EU tent - "Let's not go alone with France," says Berlin - and makes it clear that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or leave.
Germany's cautiously prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the excessively long endurance like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's FranÃ§ois Hollande looks forward to his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It's hard to imagine that they're going to rip off a leg to help the selfie Britons whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don't want either, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even deliberately be planning unhelpful comments, entirely in the SNP style, during Britain's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a failure" and "Great Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and which EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can hardly remember Boris Johnson, the ore-euro-opportunist, who made a name for himself as an "EU-straight-banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included the medley of tax-fearing villains, phone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo-non-nationals who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about them, but found that when you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him rather than become his lunch and dinner.
Indeed, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum vortex, because Blair had set the principle above the unadopted constitution of the EU, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door for him.
The press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on the back of my back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he didn't need to waste any more time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch's strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take a while, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - let me put it mildly - in development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue-color tendency and the wilder realms of Tory's petty-englandism can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn but not a Bennite" Benn said on the radio and on TV this week when the Boy Scout fought in him not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of provoking John McDonnell as a shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father tried on television to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay "in all circumstances" -- Benn's expression -- wasn't what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his comrades and deputies after all the reports at their retreat on Monday night.
Whatever Corbyn's stirring bottom-up image wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important around the clock in the age of TV and above all in the vortex of the social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that will allow him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins must think so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - are no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for whom the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC will not launch a campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of meaning in everything for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, if all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Principle Report" last month and describes it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinary windy basis" on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects PHE's claim that "the best estimate at present is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who have been convened to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to synthesise their opinions on the damage to various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was said to have previously received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting stated that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding they were reported to have received beforehand from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the panel are not provided, but this includes several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also specify industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's tobacco management.
The group's research "commits significantly" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products to most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been responded to earlier.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies from his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to this, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what is proven and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die every year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the National Health System Â£2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK stations.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in highly controversial time frames against the most popular shows of their rivals and from broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that for six years in his time at Channel 4 he had tried without success to get in touch with the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC commissions or sends programs that are also clearly shown by non-subsidized rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least order your production on programs that others do not make or commission.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, of course it's nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax program is funded that could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both in-house production.
Frankly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur in series who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was responsible for the hunt for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows reflect what former Sky director Tony Ball suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that BBC shows should sell like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-law niche programs should "go to BBC4, where you can't quite measure the audience, but they perform their duties, and they can argue if they go to their hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a window where nobody ever wanted to see them.
Regarding the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee, "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value out of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think, that you get a big value here for 150 pounds a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 pounds, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said that little of the BBC production is now officially classified as education - he said that it is 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and she should take an example on public television stations in Australia and Canada to change this into "inform, educate and entertain".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said only a handful are shown on television, and engage with commercial broadcasters alliances to make everything available online.
Sonogenetics can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction in the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on Motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method, called Sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses into people's brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the modified Motoneurons.
The method has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent to the desired place in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass tissues unhindered and can thus be sent into the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make targeted human neurons susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The Ads Shame Britainâ€™s Arms Trade
Amnesty International anti-weapons trade fair video.
Terrible killer drones!
Crushing ankle fetters!
Scatter bombs!
And electric batons that cause agonizing pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad is a militant parody for the world's largest weapons fair, produced by Amnesty International, to highlight the British government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes via Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters, which can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look.
"Important announcement: do you travel with DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the typefaces of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which turns into a tank image.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will travel with DLR ... Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs," a Â£6 pack of bus keys claiming "to gain access to about a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this posterizing "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will become more critical and try to bring political works to the public outside galleries.
Many artists get to work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-weapons trade posters greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic designer and voiceover artist, who also works free of charge.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed by the silence that prevailed around the advertising of the weapons trade fair - through a blank space of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic shady corporate advertising, but "by blushing with bright colors and animation it remains more sticky."
"They did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is the intervention of the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors spoil fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order from the US Army on "the AT4CS RS shot down from the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding after-effect effects inside the target."

Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Residences
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student residence, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I have annoyed - and the numerous long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entry into student residences ranges from slightly nerve-racking to absolutely frightening.
It's tempting to chat: people tell you where you come from, whether and where you took sabbatical year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you "honestly said Marmite neither love nor hate, because seriously, boys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like, unlike those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers were.
Leave people alone.
People's rooms often turn into beverage receptions, movie-night venues and community meeting places, but they're also the places where people dress and put on their underwear.
Related to this: Don't think about starting a relationship at university
Introverted patients receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a space-to-space strolling culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone who's trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away to get back the energy I used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student of sociability is exhausted - and send him a text message instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my dorms had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Make friends by baking.
Since you're starting college at the height of the back mania, knocking on people's doors to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the welcome of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering home-made treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk and may end up associating your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Badly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to face sleeping when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in dorms.
Of course, stealing chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the dairy owner.
The chances are that they say to use themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my roommate who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn't make a noise that keeps people from sleeping or from working.
It's not just about being a decent person, it's about you being one of the people sitting in a glass house in the truest sense of the saying.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they would mind turning drum & bass down a little bit, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for another two hours before she had her own music plÃ¤rren, locked her door and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dormitory?
Conversely, would it not be deeply embarrassing if you consider a roommate to be your future spouse, approach her, part again, and then have to see her every day and perhaps see her pull all her friends over to her?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to convince your abdomen a little reason.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the border between an lick and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments for him to become a boomerang.
Give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety by hiding - but never screw up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close her door and put her keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't stack her possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Townhouses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses for people who do not have much money in the Eckental valley in central Franconia.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need a living room, but also the single mother and the low-income earner."
"I show you how you can still build cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in an interview
Thousands of refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how cheap housing can be created quickly: he is building terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Mass housing in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because the people stay here to a large extent.
In view of the influx of refugees, we need enough housing in the next few decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
That's different when you put people in blocks of flats.
Each of the six houses, which are currently being built in the pilot project, consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
It took six months to build.
That's appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: I did my project correctly under construction.
Especially complicated it always makes the threatening Damocles sword special building and the parking lot ordinance.
Scary.
It is still assumed that those who create three apartments in a terraced house need at least three parking spaces.
Only in the cities the space is missing.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But aren't you intensifying competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It's true: We've had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford.
My project has the message, even the normal people need living space.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earner.
I show you how you can still build cheaply and well today.
That's what this is about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tap "General" and then select "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, as they receive an error message indicating that the "software update failed".
To avoid the problem, users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made this less likely by streamlining the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them as soon as the process is completed.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is close to a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off half way and this could lead to an interruption of the update.

You should also make sure that before you download, you have checked our checklist of all things to prevent things from going wrong and protecting yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Championship title in Formula One against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
The second World Cup runner-up stressed before the start of the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing left to lose".
53 points separate the runner-up world champion before the night race in Singapore this Sunday from defending champion and double champion Hamilton.
The British have already won seven of the previous twelve races in the season and are also taking on the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favourite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British rider won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have an impact on the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
A haze has been hanging over the city for days, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, so the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for a cure.
Gauselmann is the bearer of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and LÃ¼bbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation received by Chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot pay the membership fee.
Youth work and the search for talent will also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chess club and friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-WeiÃŸ" be seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town.
QuartiersbÃ¼ro seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Altezentrum Antonistift have joined forces under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, to Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, senior citizens and those seeking advice will now receive information on questions such as care insurance or benefits from health and care funds.
For years, our outpatient care service has shown that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are endless questions.
"It is also not uncommon to use many of the funds' benefits, because the complexity of the insurance is hardly understood," explained the new house owner Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the BÃ¼rgerspital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, one can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers of the Senior Centre and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The Senior Care Center", said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
Both managing directors see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in the context of demographic change.
This makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) emphasized at the inauguration celebrations, the QuartiersbÃ¼ro also dedicates itself to the association in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering".
Thus, the Social Foundation makes a big contribution that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg against WÃ¼rzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it's official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third league team WÃ¼rzburger Kickers had not yet been fixed due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6th October was now set as date.
The match of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian Totopokal against the third division club FC WÃ¼rzburger Kickers has now been finally terminated.
Played on Tuesday, 6 October, at 7 p.m. in the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game will go on stage, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz HÃ¼mmer, who also points to the ticket pre-sale that has now started.
It's special for our team to play against a third division.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlit games have a special appeal.
In 2010 FC Eintracht Bamberg took part in the round of the last 16 teams by winning the district league of 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league of 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
SpVgg Unterhaching is the defending champion.
Viennese architect Karl Mang passed away at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He passed away on 5 September at the age of 92, as the KÃ¼nstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the KÃ¼nstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was said in the issue.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned with the installation of the Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and the conversion of the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking Penalty: Tim Wiese throws money at policewoman
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese did not notice well in Bremen.
Footballer was once, meanwhile Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and engaged with Bremen and Hoffenheim, wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to have increased 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years.
But intellectually, he didn't gain weight.
Wiese just had his hair cut in downtown Bremen when he saw a parking room guard out there handing out a parking ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the shop, insulted the official and threw the fine due at her feet, as reported by the "picture" newspaper.
The city of Bremen confirms the accusations, but is not yet aware of the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under review," says the City of Bremen.
Only after that will it be decided whether meadow is displayed or not.
Authorities of Panama Destroy 4500 Marijuana Plants
The fertile soil and the typical rain forest climate of the Isla del Rey are ideal for the growth of marijuana plants.
For three days now, the Panamanian authorities have been tearing out the 4500 plants and burning them.
Men beat up 17-year-old Afghans
The police are looking for witnesses for an incident in Bad Soden-SalmÃ¼nster: On Friday evening, around 11.45 p.m., three young men were on foot from Bad Soden towards SalmÃ¼nster.
According to the police, one of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and told them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft fuel station.
There were also three people on the site of the gas station.
One of these men now yelled at the youth and punched him in the face.
The victim suffered a broken nose and bleeding from the nose.
When his two friends rushed in and appeased the thug, he at first let go of his victim.
The injured young man was brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car to their apartment and drove there demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man walked in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the thug and another male person.
A baton was used to beat the victimâ€™s face and thighs.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about six feet tall.
The second racket was said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown and white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and whistleblowers to report to the telephone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank MÃ¼ller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 euros
Silvia MÃ¼ller-Gongoll and Frank MÃ¼ller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
SamtgemeindeBÃ¼rgermeister Bernd Bormann, WirtschaftsfÃ¶rderin Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased about this.
Doctors are missing in many places in the countryside - Asendorf is lucky: Dr. Frank MÃ¼ller will take over the practice of Felstehausen on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still standing by his successor in the next few months with half a job.
After a restructuring phase, MÃ¼ller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then he is investing 310000 euros in the premises at St.-MarcellusstraÃŸe 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank MÃ¼ller and his wife Dr. Silvia MÃ¼ller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing her specialist training in the Verden hospital and is planning to enter practice next year as well.
"We always had in mind that the millers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When the time came, I just called her."
The MÃ¼ller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The closeness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says 39-year-old MÃ¼ller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years".
He also sees the advantage of being his own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the millers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, the two-time family father Frank MÃ¼ller also grew up, followed his medical studies in Hanover in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed senior emergency physician in Diepholz County and volunteered in the Bruchhausen-Vilsen DRK.
From 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a general practitioner, his wife Ursel (Internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The MÃ¼llers, both internists, want to settle down as family doctors.
"This is why endoscopy comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia MÃ¼ller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a speech room more.
In addition, the EDP is completely renewed.
The MÃ¼llers receive a total grant of 50000 euros as part of a funding programme from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued," emphasizes SamtgemeindebÃ¼rgermeister Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia MÃ¼ller-Gongoll, approximately 2000 patients come to the practice Felstehausen every quarter, in the northern German average practice there are about 500.
In Asendorf there is another general practitioner's practice.
A positive side effect of the practical takeover by Frank MÃ¼ller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had found herself, she would have gone.
By the way, those who visit MÃ¼ller's office hours continue to look above all into familiar faces: take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning staff from the Felstehausens.
With their departure an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we had only two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen recalls with a smile.
She feels a little melancholy after a long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will surely see many patients a lot," says the intern.
Her husband laughs: "We have a 6000-square-meter property."
"So far, I've always been out of gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"The border controls are now also being raised at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can make it "natural".
The care and security of the people is in the foreground.
But it is also clear that "it needs clear signals," said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migratory flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considering "corridor" - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow incoming refugees to travel to Austria and Germany and could also establish corridors for the refugees.
However, this was not exactly the view of Interior Minister Vesna GyÃ¶rkÃ¶s Znidar in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable", but Slovenia would step up the monitoring of the border, especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, was already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, however, Slovenians do not want to close their borders for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil his obligations, otherwise the system will not work," stressed GyÃ¶rkÃ¶s Znidar.
According to the Croatian government, the first refugees had already tried to enter East Croatia at the border crossing Tovarnik/Sid during the night hours of Tuesday to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees are constantly arriving in Tovarnik, Croatia.
They were mainly Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Emergency services and the Red Cross are already in operation.
In the coming days, his country is expecting about 4000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted to Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media in agreement on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was instructing people to take certain routes: "Neither can we, nor do we want to do this," it said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and more buses are expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been travelling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, some 500 kilometres away.
"We heard that Hungary closed, so the police told us to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel further through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually lead to the shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, which has already been predicted by observers, to a somewhat further westerly route.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia's Minister of the Interior Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member had "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
Strict controls are being carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of the EU since 2007, and since then the EU partners have consistently provided the country with a good record in terms of border control standards.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees are still trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the last night at the Horgos border crossing leading to RÃ¶szke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Minister of the Interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local show in Horgos: he thought the debates on alternative routes of refugees, now that the Hungarian border is closed, were premature.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
One could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia are drawn.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in parts of the border area there are still uncleared minefields 20 years after the end of the Croatia war.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine-clearers had been sent to the border region.
Stock market hackers: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Suprononok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals who have been accused of gaining insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information collected is said to have been used to make insider deals in the financial markets.
According to the investigators, this was a total of over $100 million.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our country's borders are ultimately being caught," says the SEC communication.
Trials against 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted both in the US and from Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
There is a lively operation around Mannheim Paradeplatz.
People do their errands, sometimes quick steps, sometimes leisurely strolling.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim Motor Show at Paradeplatz.
Stop the trams.
Pulsating, blazing life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large panels each with the title "Before I die I want to"....
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is faced with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went to the middle of the city and among the people with the action," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance is at the disposal of passers-by for questions and discussions as well as the volunteers.
While some passers-by spontaneously grabs the chalk and adds the phrase "yes to my life", "can read", "drive with the camper through the USA", "stop the war" or "do not suffer for long", others stop briefly, read, say sentences like "I am not that far yet" and then continue.
Again and again small discussions develop on the action itself, on life, on how to deal with death.
Peter HÃ¼binger is also on site.
"It is only when I realize that the end of the world will come to me at some point that I can live responsibly," says the director of the Deaconisches Werk Mannheim, who, together with the Caritas Association, is the bearer of the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance.
Therefore, this publicity campaign for the 20-year-old is good.
However, it is understandable that not everyone wants to publicize themselves on the tablets, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death remains taboo, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a great deal to opening people up.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Through personal experience she faced the topic, read a lot of literature and decided to engage in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid sought volunteers by appeal, it immediately registered and was present at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany those affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the hospice of Saint Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle her task well and her experiences and experiences.
"I see the life of another waiting, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and independent of denominations.
The financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tablets described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, too, further personal wishes can be recorded on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial outlook for 2016 lowered
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook to a full year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this point last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84 according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which average 4.9 percent and become effective on 4 January, and despite higher increases for ground transports of heavy and large packages, which will be collected from November onwards.
The company said that it still expects earnings to increase year-on-year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides solid returns when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS, who plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, approximately the same number as last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6% more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just below the $2.44 per share that twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has stagnated sales in its Express shipping unit.
But the boom in online shopping has increased FedEx Groundâ€™s results.
Sales in ground transport increased by 29 percent in the last quarter, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher freight labour costs.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares dropped by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At its most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahogany table to decide whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Threateningly above them at one end of the decorated, two - story meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation above all other things.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: maximizing US employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to launch, to be weaned from the unprecedented incentive by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most economic data show that it is growing solidly, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to increase this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds - even by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed is going to do, what is unsettling the financial market itself.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed raised the sentences at that time," he said.
If she does, "they must go very far in their declaration to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that an interest rate hike would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be well on the way to raising the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that this year, despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expected an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed views as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And even though inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the strain on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world shrugged at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% below its peak in May when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the May high.
For Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation of when interest rates should be raised.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks, they would have attracted the reins in this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the global economy is not a major concern of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the currency authority of the world.
The central bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by former head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could narrow its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global asset management strategy of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noted this month that "the Fed has a history of over-reactions to financial market movements that appear to be unrelated to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee with the right to vote in favour of an increase in interest rates, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite the limited discernible impact on US growth," said Lacker.
A year later, Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Poznan, former member of the Bank of England Interest Rates Committee.
The most recent turbulences do not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of an interest rate increase because the markets are getting upset," said Poznan, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should be ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/camp was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/camp is a one-stop shop and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and crockery, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this store is close to the cash desks and has various pick-up options.
What is there here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as well as the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry for you on request.
A good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, cattle blood and bile, pig-natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide gears are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the cash register.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life aid for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To give you a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are quite a few people who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She still likes to teach with her 74 bilges.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum seeker's home on Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from a proper school.
Brazilâ€™s Pediatric Society Rio Grande Promotes Nutrition for Healthy Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying in a shocking way to educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breast-feeding. It does so with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with representations of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions to the new Bernried sports hall
The municipal council Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become shallower for solar panels.
The plans for the long-awaited gym building on the Bernried sports grounds are progressing step by step: In the latest municipal council meeting, the prepared building application was unanimously approved without major discussions.
Prior to this, the board had also decided to apply for a construction "exception" or "liberation" from the current development plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special form regarding the roof construction.
According to this, a "sat roof with non-middle first and roof superstructure" is to be built.
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations: "This will bring us together a wonderfully large southern roof," explained Mayor Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the roof inclination, which is supposed to be less than ten degrees for energetic reasons - unlike required in the development plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" became necessary because the building plan regarding the roof slope does not allow "exceptions" - whereas the Bernried municipal council usually takes a restrictive approach with regard to applications for exemption.
However, gymnasium construction is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The gym building at the sports center is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
About 2.3 million euros are included in costs.
Grants are expected from the school and grassroots sports promotion.
In the next step, the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the Landratsamt for examination.
Klinik PeiÃŸenberg moves to Schongau
The PeiÃŸenberg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new Medical Director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the employees move from PeiÃŸenberg to Schongau.
This is provided for by the surprising plans of the Krankenhaus GmbH of the district, confirmed by the Landratin Andrea Jochner-WeiÃŸ.
However, the Supervisory Board will make a decision on this and it will meet next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the almost 50 employees at the hospital in PeiÃŸenberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority should move with Fischer and the further existing Inner Station to Schongau.
The rooms were available.
According to Jochner-WeiÃŸ, a job is to be offered to employees who cannot join Schongau.
The employees were informed about the plans.
The change was triggered by the dismissal of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been medical director of the Schongau Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now changing to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jochner-WeiÃŸ, the name "Fischer" came into play when it came to the question of who should take the lead from October 1st and to change to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case a "upgrading" and a widening of the offer in the area of "internal medicine", says Jochner-WeiÃŸ.
Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
For the next two years Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will manage both houses until next year the former hospital of the scarcity, which still has 35 beds, is to be closed in PeiÃŸenberg after almost 140 years.
Until now, the district had planned this for 2018 when the ongoing renovation at the hospital Weilheim has been completed.
Landratin Jochner-WeiÃŸ, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, countered rumours that the house, which is owned by the federal government, will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers.
As with the property, Jochner-WeiÃŸ could not say that there were several considerations.
Currently there are a short-term care of the Caritas and a daily psychiatry.
"What was better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come again", says Fischer about the quasi-movement to the Lech, which was received "positively and very understandingly" by the employees.
There was no real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years.
He had been asked by Schongau colleagues to take over the position of Medical Director.
The PeiÃŸenberg Hospital (one hundred beds) has been repeatedly threatened with closure in recent decades, and departments have been closed, such as surgery and obstetrics.
The handballers of the Rhein-Neckar LÃ¶wen are required tonight (20.15 clock) at the Bergische HC.
Although the Bundesliga leader is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, there is no cause for arrogance.
Last season, the Badeners suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to do with it.
Hunting accident with two injured in Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the harvest on a corn field near Pratau (district Wittenberg), several hunters were in action, as the police reported.
After firing, a 63-year-old man and a 22-year-old man suffered severe injuries and were taken to hospitals.
At first, it was unclear how exactly the accident could happen.
Detectives are investigating.
Missing 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of violent crimes
A suspect led the police to the body of the 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate who had been missing since Saturday.
During the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted that he had killed the young people and thrown their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as the prosecutor and police reported on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, is considered to be a suspect, who is reported to have confessed the crime and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed the night before after a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
When searching for the young woman, the investigators first encountered the victim's personal belongings.
Interviews among the friends and acquaintances of the missing finally revealed a suspicion against the 20-year-old.
The suspect then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the prisoner admitted in police interrogation that he had killed the 16-year-old and placed the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be brought before the prison judge on Wednesday, the investigators put manslaughter on him.
Information about the circumstances of the crime is to be provided by the further investigation.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns against housing gap
The location on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also seeking an affordable place to stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing to a market that is already overloaded in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the "Social Housing Association".
By comparison, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
This means that 140,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first-time shelter.
Many then come across the housing market and line up in the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
However, according to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing numbers of refugees.
The study also represents significant failures in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is facing a housing deficit that is growing year by year.
Currently, around 770,000 residential units were already missing in the conurbations, complains Matthias GÃ¼nther, author of the study.
Many working people therefore lived in large cities in self-catering rooms.
Young adults remained involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the slump on the housing market.
For the first time in recent years, the number of square metres per capita has fallen again in the big cities.
In order to solve the problem, the "Social Housing" Alliance proposes a fresh start.
New incentives are intended to boost social housing.
Thus, the property acquisition tax could be waived and the property tax for subsidized dwellings could be suspended for a limited period.
According to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are also necessary.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation of the state bank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros had already been called up on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free passage: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
After Hungary is practically no longer getting through, as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow transit through Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to reach agreement with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke to the Slovenian Minister of the Interior, and if necessary, we will organise a corridor," said the Croatian Minister of the Interior, Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees left for Croatia to travel from there to Western Europe.
500 people came across the border near Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV station RTL.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees the day before.
New laws that came into force on the same day also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police picked up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbour country of Croatia in the morning.
According to media reports, most of them came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came to the Serbian border town of Sid by bus as well as by taxi.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot across the green border.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
For this purpose, the border strip has other dangers: sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war still lie there in the 1990s.
Mine-clearers are now to quickly create a safe passage.
However, there are few more refugees coming to Hungary after the border has been closed.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people.
Shortly before the goal on Monday it was still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify overcoming and damaging the border fence as a criminal offence.
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
The convicted are threatened with imprisonment for up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" on the border, of which almost all - 93 - were the most important crossing RÃ¶szke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning there would have been still 40 refugees.
In practice, however, no one has the prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers will be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the "transit zone" in RÃ¶szke.
In RÃ¶szke, workers began to clean up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Barrier bars were dismantled and one of the reception facilities in the border town was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the goal of this conversion.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, only a few refugees reach Austria.
The country has also stepped up its border controls.
According to the government, around 20,000 migrants were still living in the country.
In Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the direction of German authorities.
In Freilassing smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"After the bridge festival on Sunday, we were busy cleaning up when suddenly ten people with suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
But because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees, it was over in Wernstein", said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the stranded people, together with two other helpers and their cars, chauffeured across the border to the nearby Passau.
Before that we tasted the unexpected guests, with snack and drinks.
We said we'd take her to Passau by car.
"That was a matter of course for us," said Stadler at the OÃ–N meeting.
You were very grateful.
A man did not let it take to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"We were very pleased," said Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train towards Passau on Sunday evening in Wels to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that rail traffic to Germany was stopped.
However, the regional train was parked off the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The BrÃ¼ckenfest was sociable with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, the day before a two-bridge race was sporting - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor OrbÃ¡n now sends us more tens of thousands is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping immediately in the construction of structures in the RÃ¶szke camp that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has put the attitude of the Hungarian government in the haze circle of National Socialism highly officially and publicly.
The victims of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to find out that the "praised land" she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, given the ongoing refugee flows and the approaching winter, to establish decent conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be an even bigger one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad has his hands full with the refugee shelter.
Christian Konrad is used to his word having weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
Konrad has already mastered the chaos in the initial reception centre Traiskirchen.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he said of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday also took place without much fuss, said Konrad and praised the organizational "master performance".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
Konrad expects a total of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 accommodations will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 will be provided by the federal states, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can make it.
"But it's not a bottomless barrel," Konrad said.
He has already had talks with the governors of the country.
They would have assured him that they would also create quarters for the coming refugees.
"Upper Austria is doing well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph SchÃ¶nborn, in order to clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also places great expectations in the ORF action "Help as we".
Private individuals can easily offer accommodation on the platform.
In addition, one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized yesterday the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it could not be that quarter donors must adhere to a certain height of the towel rails or the size of the skylights.
"Emergency standards" should apply for a limited period of time.
Konrad explains with his experience that, unlike the Ministry of the Interior, he was more successful in housing.
I am an elderly gentleman, to whom lies are not easily said in the face.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not incur any costs to the Republic, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
His own search for quarters has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there seem to be problems with the permit.
Linz calls for a better distribution
For the time being, the city of Linz is not planning to open up urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, as the people concerned can currently be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, in the event of an emergency, further sites will be tested for their suitability.
The city chief criticizes the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Borders are not sealed off"
In a long telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), state governor Josef PÃ¼hringer (VP) agreed on Monday to proceed with the refugee question.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off.
The continuation of the journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany was still possible.
However, there is now the corresponding border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany would no longer exist for the time being.
However, the protection seekers would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
From the other EU member states, PÃ¼hringer once again called for increased solidarity on the refugee issue.
For PÃ¼hringer, the fact that Austria is again introducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of the German approach.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "Neue Werft" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
The listed IT group S&T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building, and the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented out to young, innovative companies in the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to make them work for us," says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies in the New Shipyard and later acquiring some.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with its new neighbours - something Niederhauser promises: "The next Runtastic is just a matter of time".
S&T invested 1.7 million euros in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, one third of which is owned by the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building has been leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining space in the building is already rented out, for another 40 percent there are inquiries.
Lia Peroni owner opened second shop in the arcade
Furla handbags are the focus of the new shop.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to postpone this project in the pigeon market arcade without further ado: after all, she has now gained growth in the form of another business location.
In the Furla shop opposite the store, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from various manufacturers, everything revolves around women's handbags of the brand Furla, purses are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Prior to that, several weeks had been rebuilt.
"But I've been thinking for a long time about opening another store," says Breit.
The decisive factor for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also attracted by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Greater Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who has Italian roots.
Her fashion interests got Breit laid in the cradle by her mother.
I am most useful when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why some women are enraptured by the sight of a beautiful handbag cannot be answered with last certainty by the specialist.
Maybe it's because a nice bag upgrades every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatinate ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called show-off.
This quality also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for agitators.
Whether it expresses itself xenophobicly, concerns journalists rudely or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis politics - the candidate for the US presidential office vigorously raises the election campaign.
And cut it off well.
This is also registered in the Palatinate Kallstadt, where the real estate billionaire's grandparents come from.
The New Yorker with the FÃ¶hnfrisur is known to many in the wine village on the WeinstraÃŸe.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant place is related to it over - ten corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
==Filmography=====Film======Television=====References====External links==
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt style," says Simone Wendel.
Born in Kallstadt, Germany, she made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous offspring, among them Trump and the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would surely also be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He didn't bring it to the King of Hearts.
While there is respect for the performance of the family, Trump also tends to think that Trump is "a bit bigmouth", says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the surrounding area sounds "The Brulljesmacher" - to Hochdeutsch: the show-off, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of show-off.
Trump's success story began in 1885 when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold digger's restaurant in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate company was the first land purchase in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He had not recorded Trump because he had once left without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatine History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the film start.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigrant".
This contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"It's not as nice as he is," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandpa was born Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distanced, "he is always so upsetting".
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
Like many Kallstadt residents, pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something to the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine Donald doing that," says the 68-year-old.
It would be better if he didn't win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good".
If those who were in charge in the United States at the time of his grandfather had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says winemaker daughter Sarah BÃ¼hler.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
And: "The grapes will also mature without President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump was interviewed for a long time, saw 12,000 moviegoers, and interest also awakens in the US.
The Upper Bavarian community of Ramsau bei Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
Ludwig Wucherpfennig, Vice President of the German Alpine Association, awarded the 1800-resident village in the Berchtesgaden National Park with the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "BergsteigerdÃ¶rfer".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Club is responsible for awarding the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area shall be designated as a protected zone.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report on the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but there has been no major shift in assessments for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast from the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed to overthrow Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with the presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a week-long series of international television shows in London, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number was down from last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the Sunrise gap in recent months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for checking!

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle down on the coast of New Zealand with his two children reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
Seven's X-Factor remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and slightly beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot-Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour a total of 720,000.
Hot-seat on average 620,000.
The decline in the ratings of The Chase Australia's second night will give Nine confidence that Hot-Seat will eventually prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to beat the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman who eventually lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor was shrouded in great secrecy.
And none of the remaining three girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons Fellows the day before three become two, you may have accidentally given an indication of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood holds his lips tightly sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have left out in a lyrical way why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positive attitude the reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, when the question is asked, "If not you, who should receive Wood's last rose?", their answers could become the spoiler of the game who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly called Mackay the best partner for Wood, except for themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on earth, it's so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be a good pair.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the house call last week made her realize that Wood could be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now fully prepared for him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should vote for, if not her, she was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m. on Ten.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a fight as the Aussie Rugby League convert did in his first Punt return on Tuesday in 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to return a punt and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his post-game press conference.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his fucked-up catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne pates at a Punt that was restored in the first game district by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian follow-up had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the fumble and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career.
"That was a thing that happens, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his original debut back in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was still a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans while holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian field of arms.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his oil company Yukos confiscated and his democratic efforts stopped.
The free voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
Party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn exam in GroÃŸwallstadt of a severe crisis in Bavaria's schools, if there are not correspondingly new teachers for the many new pupils: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise we will get distortions in the Bavarian education system."
The Landtag fraction of the Free Voters meets until Friday in the Lower Franconian Commune.
In fact, quite different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Voter Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overlay the exam," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they existed during the Yugoslavian wars in the 1990s.
"It doesn't go on like this, we have to get to the causes," said the head of the Free Voter.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport free voters as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum lawsuits: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW chief criticized that several federal states were not consistent: "We would need uniform federal standards nationwide."
"Bayern pushes off, others don't."
"We must become more capable of action."
But the state policy in GroÃŸwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-standing torch remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, the Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot experiment "Mittelstufe plus" at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the secondary school level from three to four years is tested - in the result it takes again nine years until the Abitur.
But Aiwanger doesn't go far enough.
"The topic of G9 needs to be speeded up," said the FW CEO.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want it.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
Harder Wall Street helps Dax jump
The German stock market closed with profits after a trendless and nervous trading course over long distances.
It was only in the afternoon that a firmer start of the US stock exchanges led to a clear direction, which ultimately brought the Dax up by 0.56 percent to 10 188.13 points.
The MDax averaged 0.54 percent to 19 552.88 points.
The technology-intensive TecDax rose by 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.
The EuroStoxx 50 as the eurozone's leading index advanced by 1.01 percent to 3207.60 points.
Solid profits were also recorded by London and Paris trading venues.
In the USA, the Dow Jones index last recorded around 1 percent in growth.
Many BÃ¶rsians expect that the markets will take the place this Friday until after the interest rate decision in the USA and also for the large decline on the futures exchanges.
In the meantime, the discussion about the loads from the nuclear phase-out has pushed the shares of RWE to a record low and also left a deep mark on Eon.
According to "Spiegel", German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions.
The Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies then recovered somewhat, but ultimately lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares increased by a further 3.22 percent at the top of the Dax Group.
According to a trader, a positive report from the US investor magazine "Barron's" came out of the weekend.
According to this, investors currently paid too little attention to the German chip maker.
Investments in promising wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off.
Car values were in demand: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold again than in the previous year, as the industry association Acea announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of car manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent respectively.
Volkswagen benefits increased by 1.26 percent.
On the German bond market, the return on the circulation of listed federal securities fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50) percent.
The Rex pension index rose by 0.12 percent to 139.55 points.
The federal future lost 0.71 percent to 154.11 points.
The price of the euro fell to $1,1262 in the afternoon.
Around noon, the European Central Bank had set the reference rate at 1,1305 (1,1268) US dollars.
The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
4 people killed after policemen shoot rubber bullets at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bullets in a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, chief district official, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of them throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot it in the air before she pulled back on rubber bullets.
20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, known to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The dispute was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent clashes since the 10th century.
On August 4, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators have voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area.
A mixture of trade, trade and housing is planned - concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market an approximately 4000 square meter plot in direct proximity to the youth center Alte Post.
The preparations for this are ongoing.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, business and housing.
They wait for appropriate offers, it is said from the city.
What investor is in question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts had yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought a part of the property, which is located on the RingstraÃŸe / corner GroÃŸe StraÃŸe, a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement at the Kleine Meer near Emden take shape.
The investor first publicly presented plans for the project.
Many residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure retreat
For months, behind closed doors, negotiations had been negotiated, pondered, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Small Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested company, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans for the first time in public on Monday evening in the Emder Council's Urban Development Committee.
Originally this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP faction, which accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the system construction management went on the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he said to the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The project, which costs around ten to twelve million euros, has been under discussion for months.
Violent reactions among sea lodge owners who had come to the meeting caused the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the Meerbuden and member of the board of directors for the interests of the residents, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a huge block that will dominate all other buildings".
In addition, like many other project critics, he fears that the planned size of the plant would greatly increase the traffic: "There must come whole busloads, so that this is worth it," says Schulz.
What exactly happens on the well one hectare large area of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First we must have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the development plans were also variable.
Young twins at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is happy about its gorillas.
26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, it is said from the zoo.
The gender of the newborn gorilla twins has not yet been established, as Mother Dian holds them closely to the body.
First the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60% chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a broad gravure system approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verdean islands, which has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined gravure system, for example, in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60% potential to form a tropical cyclone over the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches double-donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double-donor campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations as they flee from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery to treat type 2 diabetes has proven to be efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are pathologically obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18,5 and 24,9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - stomach bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments approximately the same at 29.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% completely resolved diabetes and 28% partially.
In the medical-treated group, diabetes resolved completely only at one percent and in part at only about two percent.
In addition, the results in the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin of A1c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
However, in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, says lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastretomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved larger decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1 vs. 2.1 %), and had more of a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study by heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, in obese people undergoing obesity surgery, it was about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, without an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love Story Plays in HunsrÃ¼ck
It is a topic that is currently increasingly being considered in fiction: a young woman, unpopular and unsightly at school, meets the swarm of her youth again after years, and he falls in love with her.
So also in the recently published novel "Actually we are not like this" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love story, the novel is likely to be of particular interest to HunsrÃ¼ck readers, as it plays in boring and the surrounding villages.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan-Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents in the circumstances.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, but not appropriate.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to overcome the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It's wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions to create real peace and development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions following the September 11 terrorist attack, and pointed out that the US' violent response resulted in a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used force, and that caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Quadruple increase in use of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the US report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow highly alcoholic hand disinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of income from hand disinfectants in children under 12 years of age reporting poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol - containing mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scents, which are very appealing for children.
Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children, few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison Emergency Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let a sip of whiskey stand around, but people let these hand disinfectants within reach of children, and when children get to it, then it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six - year - old girl who had recently taken four splashes of strawberry - scented hand disinfectant at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold considered drunk in an adult by law, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed at her words and was unable to walk when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and bumped her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and store hand disinfectants out of the childâ€™s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth grade students in New York State planned to poison their "common" teacher by putting out antibacterial products around the classroom," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banished them from her room.
The police considered the thwarted plan to be "swat" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a rear-end collision on the cross-bar between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the crossbar towards the industrial area roundabout and noticed too late that two vehicles had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he crashed into the rear of an Audi with his truck and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta standing in front of it.
Property damage to the vehicles involved in the accident amounted to about 10 000 euros, the police informs.
The 33-year-old Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed.
Rumorous Cuisine: No Disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the Hoops are in a bad place, but that he will turn that around again.
Hearts will fight SFA for Neilson's accusation and Warburton will be cautious about January's new commitments that could destroy the squad's unit
Dons raise leadership over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a close win over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so the Dons created a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down talk about disharmony
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which Griffiths spontaneously rejected. Griffiths insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they are preparing to confront the Dutch leader in the table.
I don't think we're feeling under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutchman - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said, "In Holland, they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers' return.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what interests them.
There's a lot of excitement in the old-firm games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, swears Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic had to fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against MalmÃ¶ and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League, the defeat followed against 10-man from Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we have to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton cautiously at January transfers
Despite his comments only a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new entries and insists that he does not want to disrupt the Ibrox squad.
Brentford's ex-chef said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in summer have this preseason time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with retreat warning
Swansea stormer Michu, talking to Celtic during the transfer period, has indicated that he can withdraw when his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with an annoying ankle for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts set to SFA battle for Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the defender's Red Card was later lifted - the third Red Card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson stays with what he said and insists, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible hibee was reproved after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-heart player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the striker, adding, "It's safe to say that I won't return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United-Management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the decline must end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We'll get the boys back on their feet," Donnelly said.
McInnes happy to win against Hamilton "unbeautiful".
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to struggle desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory, bringing them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues that haven't won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as the figures of the Office of National Statistics (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drunk ones disrupted the process
Since the security personnel could not pacify the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the disturbers into custody.
A breath alcohol test showed 0.89 per mille in a 16-year-old.
The adolescent was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 permille and initially remained in custody.
Why I'm going to witness an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, with the exception of a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew near, I began to fear.
So why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since more applications are often available than places, a macabre lottery is held to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.
Those who are chosen will observe it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
On Twitter, a journalist from Oklahoma accused me of abandoning my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he pleases, and you'll get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have put it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't even do it if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write.
When he dies, he thinks that the publicity work will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there isn't enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'm going to see him die.
I can't say I'm really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn for it.
What you're gonna get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after wet police chase persuaded to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a Perth man to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in shallow and swampy water, only a few meters away from a police officer who tried "to gently persuade him to return to the shore."
Canning Vale's police were called to a housebreak incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about wetning his uniform, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiates".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that stewards tried to spy on him and threatened to end racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they were conducting a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for racing and that he found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt swab test at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had held back 18 months for the espionage charges and did not want it to "look like too high-hanging grapes."
"I didn't mean to say anything about it, and I sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around raised head, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
When they start thinking I'm not doing this, I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to figure out what to do with my license.
Previously, Moody had launched the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
" eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I'll name when asked - and offered him an occupation in my stables to provide information about what I'm doing inside my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, I'm sure they should grab their noses because they failed trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting President of the RVL and Bernard Saudry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are.
Is that supposed to get me to think it's going to be personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and perhaps makes people outside coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the business?
Am I that bad for the business?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and cast me out, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying is making them think about it now.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-term cobalt examination at Lidari, and the late scratching has led him to say that he "can throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar, described the race day treatment rule as "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which was contrary to the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like this last night.
It could've been like this all day yesterday, whatever it was.
But it was the same on race day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation on this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all realize that we need rules, but here we have gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested for hit-and-run
The police arrested a man in Cobram on the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent hit-and-run.
The cyclist was sent by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley highway.
The police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with hit-and-run and failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram stays in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy beats back rivals for claims to wrestling
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his players' tackling as an "agenda setting" of two Premier League favourites of the NRL.
Sydney Rooster's coach Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed the Storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high Storm victory at the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled note to the storm team after his team had scored the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "model example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the wrestling.
Bellamy defended the tacklimg of his team and said that they were only focused on their "contact" during the tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team was confident, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"This keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have turned our contact at Tackles into a real focus, and this has brought us a reversal of the trend.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this keeps coming up at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he was gonna take care of some shit about it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this.
I'm building up more trust because they say these things, because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
I don't think they thought about us six weeks ago when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters scored a higher score than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are there breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, it's the schedules.
If they mention us, it means we're going to meet them in a phase.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks the next Saturday night in the pre-finals at AAMI Park. Ticket sales start next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 bail after drug charge
A man who may be threatened with a life sentence because of his attempt to take possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released on bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in August in Coomera.
Maksimovic was watched as he met his fellow defendants in the marina during the morning and later at CafÃ© Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire amount and that the cafe could have been for a harmless reason.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a bail of $200,000 as security to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two people, it is clear that imposing a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the conditions that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily and keeps to a curfew of 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: cab breaks apart
On Tuesday evening a truck driver was seriously injured in a three - truck crash on Highway 5 near Karlsruhe.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to dodge to the left at the last moment, as the police reported.
The driver's cab of the cause of the accident was completely torn apart.
The driver was taken seriously injured to a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed over six hours until 2 o'clock.
Damage of 122,000 euros was incurred.
Stevan Hogg used phone from girls to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11 - year - old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep and logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers that were found at the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it, since it would lead to "pedophiles on the Internet" and then he " pretended to be a police officer to scare them."
Attorney Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court, "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he was sick in his head when he was drinking and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added, "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computer and playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty, in the sense of the indictment, to taking indecent pictures of children on 14 June last year, to having violated the conditions on 25 January this year and not to having appeared in court at a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, since one could argue that "no significant sexual element" can be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of the sentence.
Lockers avoid small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken up away from the major control points at the German-Austrian border.
For fear of discovery and arrest, many smugglers increasingly let people cross smaller border crossings
out on the Austrian side, said a spokesman for the Federal Police.
Along the Inn River, more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dams.
There they are received by federal police and forwarded for registration.
According to Federal Police figures, significantly more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
By 8 a.m. alone, around 700 people had arrived in the capital, said one speaker in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, 1759 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: foothills of tropical storm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of storm gusts in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) reported in Stuttgart.
The strong low was the spur of the tropical storm "Henry", which in recent days had moved from the Bermuda Islands across the Atlantic.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to the DWD, the Black Forest, the Swabian Alb and the Bodenseekreis are also expected to have gusts of 60 to 90 km/h until Thursday morning.
On Friday the sun can be seen again longer.
The crowd does it: Every two years, the car manufacturers show their innovations at the IAA.
In 2015, the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well, are particularly moving.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand: According to Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA), this segment accounted for around 28.1 percent of new registrations in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA (Audience Days from 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept cars and new high-class and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at dealerships in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the trade fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
To ensure that the volume model also sells well, the new Astra should not become much more expensive.
Opel offers an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hessen offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, which for the first time also include three-cylinder gasoline engines.
Unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door car.
The second variant will be the station wagon in spring, which can already be seen at the IAA.
And what else will be added to new compact cars besides the Astra at the IAA?
Renault MÃ©gane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor MÃ©gane into the race.
At the trade fair, the MÃ©gane can only be seen as a five-door version in a conventional and a highly sporty GT version.
He comes into the trade at the beginning of next year, then also as a station wagon.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is brand new in the segment.
With the new model, the Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits fully into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will have a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
The range also includes a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: The Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt, is also new in the segment.
The model is available with gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres (Nm).
Sale of the Baleno in Europe will start in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
On the outside, the designers of the elegant CitroÃ«n offshoot mainly applied hand to the front: the radiator grille was redrawn here and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was mainly modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touchscreen and Apple's CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
In addition, there are a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class and the Peugeot 308 GTI at the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has justified an ex-prisoner of the Tegel Penitentiary, who was housed for months in a too small cell.
Due to the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the too tight rooms (Acts 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: between June and November 2009, he was housed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space at the Berlin-Tegel prison; the toilet was not spatially separated.
After that, according to his lawyer, the man who was now at large had been transferred to a larger cell.
His official liability lawsuit for the unworthy detention conditions against the State of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges annulled the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and dismissed the case for further examination.
You see the human dignity of the man violated.
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of imprisonment are relevant to the compensation, there is a claim for compensation, it was stated.
Otherwise, "a deterioration of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared".
The Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of the money compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
Only in April did they give compensation to a prisoner because he was detained naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy of humans.
Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court on Wednesday, which in a parallel case in November 2009 had certified an inhumane accommodation for a prisoner.
The plaintiff at the time was housed in a cell of the same kind as in the Karlsruhe case for between 15 and 21 hours a day for three months.
The Berlin prisons had also hit the headlines in recent weeks because of the lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly locked up for 23 hours, the aggressiveness increases, even fights are said to have already occurred because of the tense situation.
According to the Justice Press Office, 21 jobs in Tegel are not filled due to a shortage of young people, 19 are to be eliminated in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do this"
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What's up with Germany?
According to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take in one million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this, and we can do it".
The following overview provides an overview of what will happen in Germany.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Building) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) dwellings are needed annually - and for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as previously built (250000 apartments).
However, the lack of housing is dramatic, especially for affordable rental properties: every year 60000 to 80000 social housing falls out of the price-fixing, and refugees will also apply for these particularly favourable housing.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the Pestel Institute's point of view: 80 000 social housing would have to be created annually and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion per year in funding for this.
Scientists and Federal Construction Minister agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be expected to be in employment in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically for their qualifications to help them get started, criticized Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees to find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to appreciation in the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich ThrÃ¤nhardt.
According to ThrÃ¤nhardt, there has been a political change in Germany: from the ban on working for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there was previously a ban on work for asylum seekers of up to five years, in November 2014 it was reduced to three months, as was the residence obligation, which restricts asylum seekers to one place of residence.
In society, the majority - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - have accepted the view that refugees should be allowed access to the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of knowledge of German.
There is not yet a sufficient supply of general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that workplaces are most often mediated through personal contacts.
The development of networks is therefore, according to ThrÃ¤nhardt, the KÃ¶nigsweg to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugees give their children to daycare centres, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together first," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of daycare, the administration distributes leaflets in different languages.
Should the need for educators increase strongly due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more technical schools.
In the countries, students with no knowledge of German are prepared for classes in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stochers of the Berlin School Administration.
The German Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patient students from studying - the only exception so far has been Berlin, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his attitude.
Access to the university could be facilitated for refugees who wish to study.
After all, refugees with a permit to stay or toleration will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seekers' Benefit Act when they start their studies.
In principle, the latter do not receive a BafÃ¶g, as they do not fall under the circle of eligible persons.
To date, patient refugees have had to live in Germany for four years in order to qualify for BafÃ¶g.From 1 January 2016, this period will be reduced to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, said Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
The students should get BafÃ¶g immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches, and develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that takes care of new arrivals professionally.
Rights also include duties.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact points and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain control possibilities.
This includes the willingness to act courageously against religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "are immediately entitled to stay here, in Germany, forfeited," he said on Bavarian Radio.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more a topic for society as a whole than it is today.
This will also mean that the majority society will have to change, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
As a result of European decisions, Germany has had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for almost a decade.
But it is learning very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: what migrant organisations and non-white German interest groups have long demanded and what international agreements such as the German Convention on Antiracism commit to, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees that have so far been expected, says medical president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"When it comes to man-power and capacity, we can do it," he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money had to be channelled into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery demands that all arrivals be handed out health cards at the same time as registration.
Benefits received could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to feed off so many people with the limited range of benefits provided by the Asylum Seekers' Benefit Act.
Otherwise, the doctors above all create language barriers.
Already so far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proven that migrants are getting worse informed about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practices, interpreting costs would have to be borne, she demands.
However, many refugees would also be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency clinics.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people are concerned with HIV education.
But with the partly other illnesses German doctors would be clear from their training, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even be in sight of relief.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, and many refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to be allowed to practise, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take further examinations.
According to estimates by the Bundespsychotherapeutenkammer (BPtK), at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill: Most suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from a posttraumatic stress disorder suffer from flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, rapid heart beat and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe anxiety and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, said Munz.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social services, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social services, mostly clerks or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misjudgements, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion", Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The aim is to captivate every age group with fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream in the manege on the brick.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior manager.
"Passion" - under this motto stands the current manege production.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
So the gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
"It is important to us to take people away from their daily routines and take them to a completely different world for two hours," emphasizes the 27-year-old junior director.
Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept "Manegencocktail mit Weltstadt-Flair".
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometre-long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent movies, the Cuban duo wants to record it loosely.
Lightness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is to conquer women's hearts by storm.
In addition to numerous salmon alvea, the acrobatics of Circus Probst also fascinate with sensitivity and joint.
Balance with the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinates with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Misdemeanours in the attitude of circus animals are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also comments on this: "If our animals are not well, we are not well either".
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each petting unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are read from their eyes whenever possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel well, it does not want to go into the manege.
So the top priority is to take good care of the animals.
The Probst family is particularly proud of their Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland Pony stallion and a zebra mare.
The two animals lived together in a enclosure for eight years and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the Manege, but it is the unique mascot of Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are there with all our heart."
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 pm and 8 pm.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread through the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also clouded by allegations by opposition members that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with booze calls.
Last month they had booed him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesman Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones, warning them not to disturb Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he said to journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members of Parliament concerned that immunity ends in Parliament, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity ceases to be effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and saving efforts in the company's services.
HP will later this year split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing corporate hardware and services business.
The expected job cuts result in a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses that support companies in moving to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and "will be focused on delivering unprecedented, integrated technology solutions to businesses," says a statement from the company.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto Garage was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure by HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in this field, based on the belief that closely focused companies deliver better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must be behind the injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger pointed out to Wilshere that it was only September and that if his rehabilitation is going according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four matches for England, and given its history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame with this current problem is that Wilshere had strongly ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the preseason.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
This is not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or to the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played 157 league matches in only 65 of Arsenal's last five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded the most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period of time, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he'll do it and he'll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb before the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger sets a rotation within the team.
HÃ©ctor BellerÃ­n and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little breather," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the biggest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is still undefeated after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European cup triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It's never worked with Arsenal before.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in view of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high prove.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common for men than for women.
In an effort to address the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably announced 2015 as the Year of Man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of "healthy mood" friends, his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media-led communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, joyous and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health much more deeply.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.
The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments watching football in comfortable armchairs and the longing from Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone chaplain explained to me:... "my audience role for people who feel depressed and suicidal has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I can handle it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you speak openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you're visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the backdrop completely redesigned to celebrate the day, why don't you take your friends with you for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush MalmÃ¶
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against MalmÃ¶.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG pass MalmÃ¶.
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against MalmÃ¶ at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who set the French champion on the way, but then they missed a number of opportunities before finally raising their lead when Cavani scored a headball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they not only aim for the qualification for the knock-out rounds, but also for an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class match of Laurent Blancâ€™s team with Zlatan Ibrahimovicâ€™s missed chances in front of the goal. He was later substituted in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career as early as 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League. Therefore, it's a good start to win 2:0, cause problems to our opponents and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still need to perfect over the course of the season," Blanc said.
"That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we did not score one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which could hold a 2:2 draw on the weekend in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was stabbed in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentinian wing stormer was called the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United, and he hinted at why when he walked into Marco Verrattis Pass behind the MalmÃ¶ defense before passing Johan Wiland nicely into the long corner of the net.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
MalmÃ¶, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two low-ranked midfields.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far past Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up, with some mishaps and poor degrees, not least by Ibrahimovic, who paddled in the first half alone in no less than five attempts and was then abandoned after Cavani had used him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he showed much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass by Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a shooting shot, which was steered by Wiland in the 52nd minute past the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan scored his sixth season goal after Ibrahimovic had caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that MalmÃ¶ could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final score low before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.
The coach of MalmÃ¶, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was last December.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough."
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore Collects $2.5 Billion through Stock Sales
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, affected by falling commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt redemption plan.
The London-registered company Glencore stated in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about Â£1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as Chinaâ€™s economic downturn is pushing demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought Glencore's share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange in early Wednesday morning.
The share jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened up 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced last week the $2.5 billion share sale as part of the broader plans to pay off about a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shareholdings at 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the Group.
Concerns about long-term restrained growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long escape.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official visit to Washington, takes place on September 25th and responds to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disagreement constructively," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before continuing to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyber espionage and increasing self-confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
440 hp sports cars borrowed and scrapped
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the wet highway came the evil awakening.
At a company in Gotha County you can fulfill your dream and rent and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
So did a 29-year-old from the district of Gotha.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt the dream was over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, spun on wet road and drove into the guardrail.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage to property is estimated at â‚¬40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented his move to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European Champion Xavier has been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern was obviously on the verge of signing Spain's superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight Spanish champions, three Cup winners, four Champions League winners, two Club World Champions, two European Champions, one World Champion - Xavi's title list is breathtaking.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavier now reveals that he was already in front of the 2008 European Championship before leaving Barcelona.
"They told me that BarÃ§a wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, we won nothing," he says.
And this was also registered by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummigge wanted me."
As a reminder, JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern in the summer of 2008.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
But the change did not come about.
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "BarÃ§a signed Guardiola and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 season would have been with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarterfinals of the Champions League against the Bayern over the entire distance on the lawn, switched off the reds (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the king class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted Afro-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night by HBO's Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the selected script of the project.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it when you cast the film and not when you cast the show," Damon assured me.
Brown reacted shocked, with insulted unbelief and shouted "Hoo! Wow. Okay" when the comments of the actor of The Martian strengthened.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think about -- whoever the director will be -- how they treat the character of Harmony," Brown said at first.
The only black person, and she's a hooker beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People worked for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the film's directing rights; Damon replied that her director "in the end could give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WHITE that it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After the teen Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement had a nationwide impact and urged lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against coloreds.
In February, the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," said the leaders.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sports climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a contest participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the finale.
The last task was climbing on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the challenge in time, making him the first athlete to complete the exhausting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E! News after the hard-won victory, still under the shock of winning the $1 million Grand Prize.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had it to live," Isaac E! said about his pile of money.
So all of a sudden .. like I can't even imagine what it's like... the future is unknown.
Leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course at all, did not receive any prize money.
By the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, the one with the fastest time will get it," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful prize and life changes, he receives the great congratulations.
I don't think he has any grudge about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received masses of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they'd switched roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, and today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within a half of the Houston Astros for second place in the American League Wildcard.
For Detroit, even if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun no matter how it comes," said Tiger's manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three points in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and made three runs possible.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end this year hard," Simon said.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, so I want to go into the game in a very focused way.
The designated tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-track hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the lumber well," Ausmus said.
He looked good at (stroke training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it right into the game.
At the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into the game with three runs behind them.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a Bunt, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to the Strikeout before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overrun Wall, the only man he was confronted with, in front of designated Rookie striker Miguel Sano, who snatched a two-run from right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final run in the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe beat a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Mauer made an RBI double against the Tigers' Bruce Rondon's Closer, scoring 5-4.
The right-handed man, however, stood Sano out at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from an unmovable Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran who had been removed from the injured list before the game after missing more than a month due to a back injury.
"Obviously not the beginning that I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 winning series with the runners in scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, creating another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third, ending the threat.
The Tigers advanced in the second, scoring a one-out double from Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from Center Fielder Anthony Gose to the 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reliever Right-Handed A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez retired due to an injury to the litter shoulder.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, on the injured list since mid-August, is scheduled to be activated for launch on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is eliminated from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers, since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30th
He's been missing since August 20 because of a contraction in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who arrived there will then be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She expected 450 to 750 refugees to arrive.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1000 refugees can stay temporarily there.
They are then to be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse, according to the government president responsible for the initial admission.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
Wolfgang Ischinger, head of the Munich Security Conference, considers military measures with German participation in Syria a possibility.
"I believe that decisive reflection on military options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective looking away."
Four years ago, one was glad that the cup of a military participation passed by Germany.
"Now the conflict is crashing at our doorstep," he said on Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees on the ground.
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
On Tuesday evening, Austrian Minister of the Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner stated in the Austrian TV channel ORF that no one would be sent back to Hungary.
Germany had also not sent any refugees back to Austria.
"No, it's agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement under which Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there had already been talks in this regard between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany started temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have so far not been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
Next Tuesday (22 September) the EU Interior Ministers want to make a new start at a special meeting for the binding distribution of another 120,000 refugees.
In view of the strong influx of refugees in Germany, the Federal Government wants to support the LÃ¤nder more strongly in their initial reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the LÃ¤nder, Merkel announced on late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the prime ministers at the Chancellor's Office in Berlin.
Merkel underlined that those people who needed protection would also get protection.
But anyone who has no perspective on staying can't stay in Germany either.
This view had been strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a "giant effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175 km long border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania would also be fenced off.
Unlike Serbia, this neighbouring country is part of the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent tugs from seeking alternative routes via Romania, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
Meanwhile, according to eyewitness reports, thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the ice armor of Saturn's moon, Enceladus, a global ocean is floating.
This is what researchers conclude from observations of the space probe "Cassini".
According to this, the moon is tumbling slightly on its orbit around the ring planet.
Although this tumbling movement is small, it is still too large for a solid celestial body, according to a message from Cornell University in Ithaca (New York State) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
For a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
As early as 2006, "Cassini" had discovered ice volcanoes at the southern pole of Saturn's moon, which feed water vapor and ice particles and thus feed Saturn's so-called E-ring.
At least there had to be an underground sea at the South Pole, the astronomers concluded.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must renounce approximately one month of offensive activist Valdet Rama.
According to the association, an investigation revealed an injury to the 27-year-old.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich Lions, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of forced rest".
"This is hard for us, Rama is a severe loss."
"Of course, we need to think now," said sports director Necat AygÃ¼n of the "Image" newspaper, in view of the possible commitment of an unaffiliated professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties presented a defensive man at first.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was most recently active in Belgium and was previously under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croat currently has "the opportunity to demonstrate his ability".
Rubin Okotie can return to team training after his concussion next week.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player is expected to join the running training.
Okotie had injured himself in the game with Fortuna DÃ¼sseldorf (0:3) in a violent collision on the head.
Contrary to his first fears, however, he remained without a serious blessur.
No Diet Fruit - Mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But those who want to pay attention to their slim line are often advised against them.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
Nevertheless, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Above all, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Who eats the fruits, thus supports vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The peel colour alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste very tasty.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then of course they taste pure or in sweet dishes.
A mango also gives a special touch to hearty dishes.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicory and radiccio.
And a mangochutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The US parcel service UPS again hires up to 95,000 helpers for the Christmas business in the USA.
The company had already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are wanted.
Last year, UPS had already increased its workforce by 95,000 outlays for the holiday season.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making early arrangements to be ready for the Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to parcel services.
First FÃ¶hnsturm, then striking cold front
In the coming night, the FÃ¶hn breaks through the valleys of the Alpine north side, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the FÃ¶hn blows partly with storm strength through the FÃ¶hntÃ¤ler.
After FÃ¶hnende on Thursday morning a striking cold front crosses us, which brings strong rains, wind gusts and a temperature decrease.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area above the British Isles in a strong southwest current.
On the north side of the Alps, the FÃ¶hn breaks through the valleys during the night to Wednesday.
Subsequently, the FÃ¶hn blows until Thursday morning in the FÃ¶hntÃ¤ler with gusts of 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and especially in the Urnerland partly also with over 100 km/h.
The FÃ¶hn can in some places penetrate into the adjacent Mittelland, and on the mountains even hurricanes of over 120 km/h are possible.
While stormy hair dryers provide summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees in the north on Wednesday, the humidity on the south-alpine slope begins to stagnate.
Rain sets in here, which lasts until Thursday night.
In total, south of the Alps, over the next 48 hours, some more than 100 litres of rain per square metre have to be expected, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning the FÃ¶hn runs out of air, in the following a cold front with strong, partly wittily interspersed rain rolls from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures decline significantly.
The following days present themselves in the north autumnally with 15 to 20 degrees, in the south on the other hand it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees on the weekend.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a hitherto nameless place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on Wednesday in the name of the German Reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now recognized as a "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name was requested by the Association of Protestant Churches in Rome.
On Wednesday, Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled that Protestants in the city of the Popes, for centuries as a minority, were often only able to live their faith in secret.
With the square it becomes symbolically visible that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent a few months in Rome at the turn of the year 1510/11 as a young Augustinian monk.
He felt that the city was then a depraved babel of sins.
His negative impressions may have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome, according to historians.
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western church with his theses against the indulgence trade.
Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar Old Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
At the beginning was the painting for Otmar Alt, who formulated his personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
The 75-year-old has preserved his "language" with colorful colours and imaginative forms - but this is by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite bleak.
For about three years, Otmar Alt has been working on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many subject areas of the "Book of All Books".
The result is cycles devoted to themes such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, commandments or the Lord's Prayer.
With this he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective biblical passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into today, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's painting.
They are embedded between the original biblical quotation by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry binding has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old doubles a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
That's a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter order.
"The upbringing has already happened with the cane," remembers Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to work this out, in order to perhaps get along with the Lord Father again."
His second concern is to help art to become more important again in a fast-paced period: "The perception of image worlds today is characterized by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is being suppressed.
Artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall into" the images, let them have an effect on themselves, discover and feel what power they have: "The image is looking for its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung that "always" had been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Alt had not taken care to fully grasp the Bible, but had chosen the subjects that were important to him, including those of mystery.
"This was not cooperation at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text merely explains." A picture Bible was created.
For Hans MÃ¶hler from Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation "to deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's pictures speak for MÃ¶hler both the (biblical) language of love and the one of responsibility.
Part of the originals - pictures of paper and canvas - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15 November at the Otmar-Alt Foundation.
Start of construction for BMX track nears
Plans made, place found, company commissioned, earth mounds modeled for a circuit: One year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX-Bahn was already finished.
Failures in politics and administration caused frustration, especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the train.
So hill deported, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will be received in October, the First Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now able to inform the Children's and Youth Committee.
"I hope that something visible will happen this year," she said.
The work at the former indoor pool should then be started without a "further memorial break".
DFB intensifies its commitment to refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga is setting a clear signal on the weekend.
Football responds to the worsening situation in Germany and assures policy-makers of its help in addressing the problems ahead.
"I consider this to be the greatest challenge facing our country since reunification."
"In principle, no one can say it's none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
"Everyone has to be interested in getting this topic under control," said DFB CEO Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I will be in the Chancellery next Wednesday and will meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ã–zoÄŸuz and the Chancellor."
"The issue will certainly play a central role here," he announced.
Football can and will help.
But politics must set the decisive course.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," said Niersbach on the margins of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federal leagues also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs set a clear signal when they will wear the imprint "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," said Leverkusen's sports director Rudi VÃ¶ller of the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as "a matter of course".
"The refugee drama goes to everyone, no one can look away."
"We soccer leagues can, no, we have to use our radiance, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
This Friday, the women's national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the European Championship qualification match against Hungary.
Niersbach referred to the support of refugees as "a large joint venture of German football".
It was great that all 36 licensing associations had started their own projects in their places.
Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we have issued is lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this year and next, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will each make available 300,000 euros for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called up the whole amount for 2015", reported Niersbach.
Reports: Chief Executive Officer of SAP loses an eye in the event of an accident
Bill McDermott, the CEO of Europe's largest software company, has lost his left eye due to a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the USA he fell after midnight on a water glass, which he had carried in his left hand, reports the "Wirtschaftswoche" on Wednesday.
"He almost bled to death, passed out, then dragged himself out to the street - he told us so last week", quotes SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner, "WiWo".
McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October, we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully capable of working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he would come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full for SAP, full for my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott of the SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he has not been at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
To him it is important to go public with such a personal story, said the manager of the "SZ": "To everyone such a thing can happen."
"It's important to get up when you fall."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of combat...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He is therefore no longer eligible as a reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the night race in Singapore on the weekend, as was the case a week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group match of the Europa League have finally broken.
The national player will also miss the league leader of the Bundesliga in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 o'clock/Sky).
"Unfortunately, we cannot rely on him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen was left open by the BVB coach: "We expect him to return to training on Friday".
In view of the high load on his pros, Tuchel will not only change his regular team at the Reus position.
So he announced a change in goalkeeper position.
Therefore Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman BÃ¼rki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football instructor praised the world champion.
However, whether Weidenfeller will be used in all European League games in the future left Tuchel open.
He will most likely also compete in the second game.
Mitspieler Reus's research statement that the final move for BVB in the Europa League must be the goal is understandable, says midfielder Julian Weigl: "Marco is not so wrong with this."
"I think we have a good chance of grabbing the title."
Robotic cars: Government wants to lead the way for Germany
According to the Federal Government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke of a "new age of mobility" on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA car fair.
Automated and connected driving will increase road safety and reduce congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who will also meet representatives of industry at the IAA.
Among other things, the Ministry of Transport's strategy paper stresses the importance of mobile broadband expansion and rapid switchover to digital radio.
A test track on the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed to test new technology.
To ensure that the driver "does not face any additional liability risks", the Federal Government wants to "check the legal framework conditions and, where necessary, adapt them to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to raise the maximum permitted speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government also wants to promote an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, the driver is becoming more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads "are to be expected far after 2020".
The authors of the study estimate the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German location to be around 8.4 billion euros for 2025.
"The digital networking of passenger cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport," said SPD transport policy-maker SÃ¶ren Bartol.
However, the issue of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans are still skeptical about self-driving cars - much more than French or American cars.
A survey carried out by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organisation Dekra on Wednesday at the AA concluded that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail over the next ten years, 32 percent expect this in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomously driving cars by 2025, and 33 percent in the USA.
At any rate, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to surrender control on all roads throughout the journey.
On the motorway, 15 percent could imagine this in running traffic, 45 percent in traffic jams.
Well, every fourth would not leave the car to control under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis-EM
According to the current state of play, the DÃ¼sseldorfer wants to open the title fights from 25 September to 4 October only in the individual.
The final decision should be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to win the title without Timo," said coach JÃ¶rg RoÃŸkopf during the European Championship course in DÃ¼sseldorf.
Boll was on the flight at a long-term sponsoring appointment in China at that time.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite," said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the betting list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the 2013 European Championship in Schwechat.
"At that time Timo was also missing, and we became European champions."
"We should be guided by this," said the fifth in the world rankings.
English football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by HÃ©ctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a broken shin in the 20-year-old player of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible
It's a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wax-figure grousling cabinet: Designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: mannequins that look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.
They bear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, with Madonna's stage outfits, became the great star of the fashion scene - and with that he put men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I am the Enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair."
"It used to be bleached, but now it's real," Gaultier said.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), which will be shown in the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung from 18 September, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude towards a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already made a stop in Montreal and Paris before.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hard-to-understand work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellently choreographed Gesamtkunstwerk, for which a lot of effort has been done: For example, a stylist was hired to freeze the dolls.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the makers of 14 tons of material have crept to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special treat: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He had always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and in people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old teddy is also on display in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer's first, timid, fashionable attempts at walking.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he had put on his teddy bras and clothes, Gaultier said.
His parents wouldn't have allowed him to play with a doll.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later I bought them, of course.
For his first fashion show he could not pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener lace as a fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen were about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and laces were created in large quantities for customers who, for example, processed them into blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a greater role, was then supplanted by the home textiles industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: lace in jewellery, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past stylistic epochs, is creating an increasing potential for order.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze and Embroidery together with nine other companies.
Only they may wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have been lost.
Private specialist shops and also the wholesale trade almost no longer exist.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
Today, mass goods are produced much cheaper in Asia and are distributed almost exclusively through chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the USA.
So there are plenty of reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have been running a seal of quality that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible."
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diplomdesigner Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger branch of the WestsÃ¤chsische Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian region, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a field of tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies, which must above all think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball peak.
The machine embroiders small balls in some places.
The Plauen goldsmith master Bianca Hallebach-KrauÃŸe was inspired by this: "Before, I couldn't do anything with traditional Plauen lace."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also supplies to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a souvenir.
I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Plauen lace.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends shouldn't be touched, but Disney still dares to make a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, it's not a remake, but a kind of sequel that plays with the magical nanny 20 years after the first film.
It's about the experience of the Nanny with the Banks family in times of the Great Depression in England.
Those who play Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews are still unclear.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi pushes to open up the economy to the world
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group responsible for steering the reform that the economy needs to open up more outwardly in order to promote growth.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
Promoting start-ups and advancing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, said Xi.
The leadership group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list to regulate market access, relaxation of border control policy, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), to raise private capital, and overhaul of the resident reporting system.
After the statement, a negative list is drawn up that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also relax controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open up government-controlled sectors, other areas will be opened up to private investment.
"The government will not change its foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services to them," the statement said.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to perform their duties and to appoint professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predatory fish
The European Commission intends to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and thus expect consumers to receive a significantly higher dose of the nerve poison.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding working paper from the EU, strongly criticised the plans: "Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are being passed on to pregnant women and young children with full force," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily contaminated with mercury that, on the basis of the remaining limits, about 50 percent of the catches cannot be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would then be unsaleable.
In return for this easing, the EU wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram, according to Foodwatch.
Foodwatch described this as a "trick" because smaller cetaceans, such as carp, are usually so low that they already meet the planned maximum levels today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversion that alone helps the economy", Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which accumulates strongly through the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn children".
However, the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through coal combustion.
According to written information from the Federal Environment Ministry, the German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tonnes of mercury per year, two thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "persistently and widely exceeded", the "mirror" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already one of the most frequently reported health risks in the EU RASFF warning system.
