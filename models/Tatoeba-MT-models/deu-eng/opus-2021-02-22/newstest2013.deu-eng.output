A Republican strategy to counter Obama’s re-election
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth, affirming that election fraud in the US is less frequent than the number of people killed by lightning.
By the way, in 10 years, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for holding the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have since 2009 promulgated new laws that make the process of registration or ballot more difficult.
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the November 2010 elections, with 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, limiting the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the time limits for early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day, and deny citizens the right to vote for which a court file is available.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state asked voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Law in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states forcing voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often to be paid to get the required ID.
The new restrictions have disproportionately affected young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This is even more important.
Students who are regarded as voters who vote more for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs to vote more strongly for the republican side to use the tickets issued by these clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no state requested proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws demanding voters to demonstrate their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting hispanic votes.
For it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican legislators promoted laws in eight states that abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, campaigns to register voters in the 2004 general elections have helped to register around 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the proportion of new voters registered in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, although they accounted for only 13% of the state's voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
By contrast, the whites, representing 76% of voters, accounted for only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult.
Democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear goal of influencing the results in the states that are crucial for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center in 2011 shows that those states that have passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required on the electoral panel to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be made or not?
The PSA test, in fact, sometimes has faulty results, with false negative or false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation among the already indecisive men in carrying out early detection tests.
Should the test be taken or not?
We've caught up with the opinion of two specialists.
In the US studies, there were numerous disruptive factors between control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in mortality in patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that in follow-up after 12 years, the probability of formation of metastases is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years, if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin are also at higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must really understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancers can remain untreated if they do not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is more likely that the disease will be actively monitored.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are offered active monitoring and treatment as the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should and who should not be treated are determined with increasing accuracy.
That is why I recommend that the test be carried out.
The most important thing, however, is to talk to his doctor to determine if he should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument that makes it possible to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all were to eat well and move sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this figure would rise to at least 50%," stresses André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It seriously damages people's health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," laments André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, obesity and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, rectum, rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity protects against colorectal cancer throughout life," he adds.
Nutrition
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of developing cancer of the Grimm or rectum.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study has found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another has shown an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not yet been clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu also stressed the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and family problems.
"The execution of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson analyzes
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson last summer caused a certain stir, and for good reason.
Indeed, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model - our best or "at least false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists it is not yet completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but data is still missing to be completely safe about it.
Nevertheless, let us assume that it is actually the Higgs, since there seems to be only a small risk of being deceived, and let us look at what it is about.
There is an inevitable law in this world that causes two objects not to be present at the same time in the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try too hard as you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that for them, too, such a law applies: the Pauli principle of exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantum state", whereby this "state" consists by and large of some of its properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons, a vicious gang of anarchists who are not sacred to anything - definitely not this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which by the way is absolutely amazing): the mesons we will not treat here and the "force particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
It must be emphasized here, however, that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, it is only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
In fact, if a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" at that exact place, roughly like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbation" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
Stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" for this boson to show up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little similar to a frozen pond whose surface could only be torn apart by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator like CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interacting with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don't - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold on to the refrigerator by itself.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (like the photon) have no mass.
What can all these researches be "good" for, Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science, they are used to verify the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to closely examine all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who eagerly hope that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still has great shortcomings, since it does not explain gravity (ups!) and dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found in CERN.
Impact
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there are none.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the laser pioneers in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first continuous stroke laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - has already said that the laser at the beginning was rather regarded as a "laboratory game".
Imagine...
In addition, applications may also result from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, during his work in optics, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras worldwide and awarded it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
With its Committee on Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, which consumed him, had given him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in Victor-Gadbois' home for palliative care in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped with food.
Bravely he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhea, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man pees standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Returning to childhood is unacceptable humiliation for certain persons.
"This depends on the person's ability to take a step backwards," he notes.
In the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great events take place in the midst of these regressions.
The patients who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the doctors and nurses who take care of them no longer overload them with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation".
But the disease really made me meet my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more desires in life," she says, before accepting that she is put on a mask that helps her breathe.
In the next few days she is still expecting a last visit from her son, who comes from Italy.
The home Victor-Gadbois offers a group of volunteers body care and help with food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec there is a bed for palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little, considering that one day we'll all die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given oral care with brandy or pepsi as desired.
Diabetic patients no longer need to control their blood sugar level.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning, his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," reports nursing director Nathalie Savard.
In the home Victor-Gadbois is no day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years of age who enjoys the last family reunion in the yard and is well supported by his pillows as one toasts in his honor, a young man of 36 who is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children dies tragically after he has tried everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients less than 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel with concern.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care intended to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Home Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Domestic Palliative Care in Greater Montreal, are more or less exclusively specializing in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great inadequacy in Quebec health care that makes sure that several doctors specialised in palliative care look forward with concern to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent figures in palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not efficient enough to ensure that all have the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting to go to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who had been in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain without any action being taken to alleviate her.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients hard until the last day despite the worst forecasts.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she stopped an arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she answered me that she was sorry that I was giving up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not accepting this wish after their pain has been alleviated by a palliative care team.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care in the Montreal area, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which results in the patient being either sporadically or permanently put to sleep until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the possibility to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not alleviated all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to put me to sleep," but "I want my pain to be relieved."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism fellowship from Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials from the Road Construction Office, major construction companies, fund-raising political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafia are involved.
A "industry" that was very expensive for Quebec's taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has disintegrated since drastic measures were taken," jokes Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former head of Montreal police.
The scandal was revealed by him as a result of an in-depth investigation of the embezzlement in connection with the road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he emphasizes, "the Department of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars in contracts," as some were restraining their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops to the government’s auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the officers of the "Marteau Troupe", which since 2009 has caused the Montreal Canalization Cartel to be more restrained in the artificial bloating of the contracts...
Over the last few weeks, she has carried out row by row house searches and charged fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as Mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He is suspected of receiving bribes repeatedly in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers from the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were explicitly accused.
The latter attracted attention by declaring to the Commission the operation of the "system" for the maintenance of public contracts.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal for several years to a mafia-related broker who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito played his hand everywhere by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also confessed to having organized illegal funding for former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts whose costs were artificially increased by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of 736,000 dollars in return for sewer contracts, whose costs he artificially inflated.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they were lubricated by artificially inflating the bills with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the Mayor's Party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his funds with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which plunged Montreal into a severe crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, from 2010, she refused to sell a municipal property that was purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
From the investigation that is ultimately being carried out, she says that she "draws on a thread that allows us to understand the functioning of the ants-infiltrated system in order to stop the evil and denounce the culprits."
She says that the procedure is "painful but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but we need an investigation unit for Montreal only, as well as supervision to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "mandates who are aware of the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Based on a 70% share of black money in the funding of the Quebec election campaigns, he jokes: "I was told that this was just a weak slip of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit the donations to parties to 100 dollars, which according to him would not change the situation: "Until campaign spending is strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We cannot go deeper; by getting to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal, Mr Duchesneau calls on those who laugh to take a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress at her side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play every day.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I don't break out with enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the center of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne I have always progressed step by step.
They take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new arrivals of this summer are used to playing games at very high levels.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This leads to a player like me who has to face up and wants to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1 and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he's going to win more titles in Paris.
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation of my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken us the place of the leader.
We're in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the eighth final in this way.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have our voice against very good European teams.
First, we want to be the first of our group before Porto, so that we can play the rematch of the eighth final as a home match.
Can the PSG become a major European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for...
In order to become a big European club, Paris has to win titles and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
The PSG has the financial means to take concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a great failure not to win the Ligue 1 title, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, it is really important to us to remember this title.
Last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be champions with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are struggling to win the title, I think we have the power to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
Considering what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We totally accept that.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0 and you still find something you can blame us for, that is certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what else people expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we have proven our strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club that hasn't been able to qualify for the 8th finals for two seasons, and has also made huge expenses!
With regard to the sums invested, you were believed to be 15 points ahead for the break!
This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won it.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
All the better to speak of a "Zlatan dependency".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and scores many goals.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Wherever he played, he has made it clear that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 European Championship with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was important to me to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from hitting out some playtime.
I saw things there from which I grew stronger.
Today I manage to make good matches in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
We have learned our lesson from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we must show exemplary behaviour.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and stimulates the victory.
Just like Laurent Blanc did.
But I don't want to make a settlement.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is the draw that was forced on 16 October in Spain (1:1) a prelude game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has fought for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
Bitcoin makes it possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between participants.
Moreover, as is so often the case in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, shaped by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
Indeed, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which enables the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the price of Bitcoin reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell five months later to 2 dollars before recovering to around ten dollars today (the prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to traditional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy (and sometimes exchange back) through games.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and handled every time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depository of the invoice book, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
The difference is that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public accounts accounting book distributed throughout the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a dismemberment of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is hacked.
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If one user wants to pay twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money for cheating, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unconnected as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but divisible to a hundred millionth, which leaves a certain amount of room for manoeuvre...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services to Bitcoin have been attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for paying with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "Mega closing sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, who converts Bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend to rethink hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to prevail, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
Moreover, the ECB's report envisages reassessing the various risks considered high today in the event of this currency's success.
We moved out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
We have punished Afghan farmers in particular by considering them terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and injured.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often also of peasants who refuse to have an armed foreign presence, such as the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though they have joined jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed by French loans, took place properly.
The convoys of trucks and tanks flown by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban inflows into Kabul.
Since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was overrun by war due to the struggles of the various rebel groups.
Their takeover of power was then regarded as a kind of liberation and a return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the peasants overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujahedin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen by confiscating government land to sell it as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive American subcontracting.
They have discredited themselves, and most of them have not been involved in the struggles themselves.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as well as those who were able to make use of the American donations: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and have enjoyed its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be provided with jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Are the authorities under whose authority they will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province that will elude the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from a certain degree of decentralisation in the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of prime minister, which existed since the constitution of 1964, the USA wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want any foreign controls, especially at the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country destroyed by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense mineral resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to seize it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, let the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) do their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the main employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' and boys' grammar schools, French Institute at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous charitable works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation to try to "win the hearts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, which required a large number of local workers, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys, often at a height of more than 2000 metres.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the insurrection led by foreign groups, which according to their own statements is their wish, it would be necessary to continue with less, well-controlled and directly related civil aid in their favour.
A constitution with the crowbar in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever in relation to the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited power of attorney, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state granted this assembly two additional months to complete its work.
Egypt has now been relying on a provisional, amended text for almost two years, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only led to an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "broken his word" and "stepping the law with his feet".
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time which forces the brothers to renounce their intention to explain the text to the Egyptians section by section.
For the President, it is also a way to regain his public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest is raging throughout the country.
After an interview with the American newsreel Time, Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably.
Especially since with this recourse to a hasty vote the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited authority", the latter should supposedly end after the adoption of the constitution.
Eighty-five largely Islamist members of this constituent assembly yesterday adopted the text in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals have not complied with the call.
Shortly before the Declaration of the Constitution in mid-November, they turned away because they believe that they have not been able to express their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve the quorum, 11 members, alternate members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles have mostly been adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed in the time of prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the pendulum clock of the Constituent Assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, finally remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made a stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their goodwill and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
"Holyness" is the response of the liberals, who see it only as a propaganda strike.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
In particular, they have an eye on Article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt's specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because "the people who are called for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy at all.
One can see in this the first signs of a theocracy".
Liberal fears are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be much less moderate than the current one.
"There is currently no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics, some of whom have been trained in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, that "in relation to Article 220 there may be ambiguity, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
One refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, note d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised for the far-reaching powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In line with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defence of human rights have called for.
The latter also share their concerns about the text they regard as threatening freedom.
The facts of the blasphemy are being maintained and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no more article refers to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The proponents of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await sacred sites, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land unites the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and untouched nature.
AIF gives you the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Bow to the Sacred Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the conversion of water into wine at a wedding celebration, walking on the water, the breastfeeding of the sea storm and fishing.
It was here that Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the sanctuaries, however, are found in Jerusalem.
Believers here follow the path of suffering or the Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the church of the tomb on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands in the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place of the Jews - the Wailing Wall, the remains of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Take a trip uphill
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 AD.
They are located on a rock face in the mountains at an altitude of 450 meters above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else brings a cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous ski resort Hermon, into which it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometres.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Not all of them can be visited on only one trip.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There, ancient Quran manuscripts or Dead Sea Scrolls found in rock caves in the Judean desert are kept, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited there.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the former visitors and bath attendants.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most poignant section is the monument to children built to commemorate the 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
Upon entering the room, there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and of the lands in which they died shall be heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing Something for Health
The three main recreational areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
At each of the three locations there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salinity and thus carries even non-swimmers easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt brine) and medicinal mud as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and for the calming of damaged nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Antiquity
The old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast, hides these secrets.
Through this city was the famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow alleys named after zodiac signs.
According to legend, Fortuna is held by all who touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries on photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can roam through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
Evening concerts and operas are performed in the carefully restored theatre today.
Bookmarks for tourists
If you're going to Israel, don't worry about your poor English skills: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the journey is not taken in Euros, but in Dollars, which can simply be changed into Shekel (current exchange rate: 1 Dollar to 3.8 Shekel).
In the city you usually get ahead by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a expressway and in Haifa the only underground line in the country with six stations, which connects the lower city with the upper city.
Actually, it's an underground funicular.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the means of transport, which includes changing for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, sea products, fish without scales and food that contain both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with mutton and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls made from pureed beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this there are many well-fed cats, who roam comfortably and unmolested through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like busy places and don't say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a rental car costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional 15 dollars a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, prior to the visa waiver on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money on language
While MPs and civil rights activists discuss the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with counterfeit certificates
Every year 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families that remain in their home country.
On 1 December, a law came into force requiring every migrant worker to take a test certifying knowledge of the Russian language.
Until now, this scheme only applies to migrants who wish to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing sector and in the retail trade.
However, according to the Federal Migration Authority, the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers in the future.
It is not only language tests, but also tests that have to be put into Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the receipt and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also excluded from this law are persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Purpose, issues and protection of rights
The totality of the examination places will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of Friendship with Peoples, Moscow State University, St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centres have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Before the law came into force in the press, however, civil rights activists asked the following question several times: What is the point?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills bring for both the Russians and the guest workers?
In particular, spokesman for the Migration Authority said, the aim was to reduce the number of forced labourers.
"Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says Viktor Sebelev, head of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must be protected before they leave.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical assessment.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who, under the pretext of help, will put him in a dark, narrow barracks, where he will endure with dozens of his kind months without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day.
Many complaints from our migrants reach us.
"In your home country you are promised the one thing, and on arrival you will be cheated, your passports will be taken away and you will not receive the promised salary," confirms the head of the Central Employment Migration Office of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripov.
Don't scold me, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they not only do not know the language of the target country, but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the evil: only a few Turkmens, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford a reasonable primary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As a teenager, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to make money.
"It is difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists stress the following important aspect regarding the law.
Only migrants with legal status have to take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no exam and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers continue to reside illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Access forbidden to unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
Moreover, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that most of our documents are forged and we are not registered, and this then results in cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tajike Umed Huschkadamov to journalists.
"Don't shy away from the cost of false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants can be falsified.
Some falsified certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The falsified papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get it for nothing: every migrant who hoped to be able to spare himself the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption in order to prevent the certificates from being easily purchased is shared by both officials and civil rights activists.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will have time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered places in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.
Interior Ministry ignores illegal arms market
Excessive proportion of legal weapons in criminal offences
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans to tighten the arms law for private arms owners.
The authorities are reacting to recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven dead in the amok run of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov.
The police want to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be presented to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "attracting the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, the authors of which - representatives of various arms associations - ask the authorities to refrain from "sensibly tightening up".
The percentage of crimes involving registered weapons is very low, said the criminal lawyer, Vasiliy Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior's statistics, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed over the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1.168 thousand crimes were committed over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private arms owners will not stop criminals from using themselves on the black market.
At the moment, according to the authors, any weapon for little money can be found in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons enter the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel are illegal weapons stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen from both the police's armory and directly from law enforcement staff.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
Many military camps often saw explosions.
"There is evidence that some cases were arson to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, the weapons manufacturers also make a contribution to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that do not stand up to international competition and therefore squander the weapons under hand on the black market, for example in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its own, sometimes artisanal production, as well as a mafia that organizes smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the share of each of the five channels in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on weapons portals.
According to the investigators, most of the illegal weapons come from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons in the black market were there through the "debt of those responsible for their work with weapons," the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% are due to thefts in weapons production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at a gun shop, who does not want to be named, assures us that no one has been buying weapons found in illegal excavations for a long time, as they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for traders to get supplies in an armory.
An ensign buys a weapon, such as a TT-type pistol.
The weapon is issued and handed over through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know everything and, therefore, if they fail to comply with the crime detection plan, they periodically purchase checks from dealers who offer illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"Like in the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers find each other most often through acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone noticed me and suggested to come to the "Begowaja" station, where a person would be waiting for me to take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
I only learned the price of the gun there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need an acquaintance who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such an acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and agree with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who lets tell that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm even coming to some rings right now about an acquaintance I trust.
He also gives me the rings because he knows I don't rat him out.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former militaryman Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "everything" was depicted.
"I felt like I was in the luxury store," recalls the military member.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we will negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
Neither any papers are needed nor there are personal meetings.
"You only need the right amount of money", says the advertisement on the website "Buy a gun or rifle".
There, users give up their orders and make inquiries.
Is it sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," asks user "Iwan" (literally quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless bogus websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons go to the service heaped on the net.
People come like hungry fish in feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible parties accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon," reports the press spokesman of the non-profit organization Pravo na oryzhie Dmitry Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can also go out empty and get behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless bogus websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons go to the service heaped on the net.
"People come like hungry fish in feeding and then end up in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to shovel coal," he says.
A Makarov for 100 US Dollars
According to experts, the purchase of illegal firearms is expected to cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization Pravo na oryzhie, you can buy a gun of the type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps by middle-ranking guards.
According to the Ministry of the Interior's official statistics, the number of illegal weapons offences across Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand between January and October 2011, while the number of cases of theft and extortion detected in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the US
One in four American youths sits behind the counter of Mc Donald's
In recent days there have been massive protests across the US against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will swell even further or whether they will soon run out of air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to establish trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organized as a trade union.
46 cents a year?
The protests started last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the United States, attracting millions of customers, which sometimes led to handcuffs.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, quit their jobs and striked along with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain whose target groups are low- and middle-income individuals.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the marginally paid Walmart employees buy only at their own workplace.
The prices and the product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods so cheaply only because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, for example missing forklift trucks or hand scanners.
The protesters on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the company's health insurance had risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour cannot afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from California University in Berkeley prove that if the company raised the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than they're now donating to pay.
If Walmart were to fully convert the wage increases to customers, every purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
That would be $12.39 a year for them compared to today's additional spending.
Proponents of Walmart are pleased to note that only nine states have protested and that they have not caused any losses to the company.
The Black Friday lasted the next day in its store from 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday to midnight, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart cash registers carried out almost 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees dropped out of work and the protest action was merely "another PR trick" of the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart stores (which are not wanted in this progressive city and are therefore so far nonexistent), but McDonald's and other low-priced restaurants.
McDonald's says the company's selling billions of portions, and yet you're not getting sick days, and you're not getting paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Under federal and New York legislation, the minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average their simple employees in New York get 8.90 US dollars an hour.
Less than she earns no one in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get along with so little money in New York is incomprehensible to me.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all American youths were behind the counter at McDonald's after school, but the youths still lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there for longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's employees, I constantly meet people who complain that they have to get along with this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The U.S. law forbids corporate management to stand in the way of this goal and to call off or dismiss union members.
On the other hand, management does not make it easy for them.
However, the creation of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Unsatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at noon before McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Councillor Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and yet you're not being given sick days, and you're not being paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should work together to support the fast food workers so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were there, of whom not all are employed in the fast food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet foreseeable whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"The brain is only moderately outsmarted so far"
The theme of enlarged reality, popular with followers of modern technologies, has been commonly perceived recently by the lens of special glasses.
At first, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had also applied for a corresponding patent.
In conversation with the head of the interactive 3D technology group at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear, however, that the glasses were only a through station for the company's scientists.
It excites the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and to create virtual open spaces.
- Please give a brief description of the research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but want to expand the limits of this interaction.
So far, mankind has largely been stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to anticipate 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are progressing, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else can we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought interaction to a physical level, much is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) has been improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could easily complement the real world with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, since it raises questions about privacy, because one does not always want to inform all bystanders about his actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the area of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project in which we experimented with short and short gestures instead of unloading gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a watch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as gestures and language.
- How so?
We'd like to ask you, for example, to hand you this bubble can?
They say it and at the same time point to it.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does that mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and cannot do at the time?
- Not necessarily, but it's about mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the development of new types of sensors, which will enable people to capture reactions more accurately.
These can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer good resolution at depth, which is very important.
- What requirements do you place on modern cameras based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of algorithms have more work to do.
Not only the resolution along the X- and the Y-, but also along the Z-axis must be taken into account.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and frankly, the present 30 fps are too little especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our Redmond laboratory with a adjustable processing delay of between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between man and machine.
For my work, I needed just such a device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or amplify the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system in which we could play with different camera angles to see how this helps us to determine a position in three-dimensional terms.
- If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that with regard to the application of the technology of enlarged reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it's not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in the raised hand on the way, but I think this: The greatest variant would be a "changing" expanded reality in which we could switch from glasses to smartphones via a cloud.
The glasses are a personal gadget and that's their strength (only you can see private things), but at the same time their weakness, because an expanded reality with glasses prevents you from working on virtual objects together with others.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point to: there is no tangible response!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often talk about the fact that the expanded reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection document.
She perceives pressure excellently!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "images in the air" something tangible, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is at the moment however weak, as if someone blew over the hand bales.
There are also bands for the wrist that act on the nerve endings in the fingers, also this is a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
Make it think that it feels what it should feel when it's seeing something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried yet.
Here is another task that we will have to struggle with for a long time, namely to make a person physically in a closed room believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large spheres.
So far, the brain is only moderately outsmarted, and we still have many busy years ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes working in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: We are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to urban dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
High-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and which often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia, have already landed on the select list.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the bearded bear dressed in red, which can be found at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scene meetings or at vernissagen.
Wherever Kirill Miller's paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and by his presence on the street conjures a smile in the face of his fellow citizens and ensures a good mood for them.
Recently he grabbed a rotary organ and became a Petersburg organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artistic existence, philosophy and image.
Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the look and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, anything that differs from the norm of grey causes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you needed to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture where my works were exhibited.
I realized I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I made friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with representatives of "Gazonevzhina"; from this "Pushkinskaya 10" was created, and then first it was finished.
I am drawn to theatre, to fashion, to music, to everything but literature.
It was important to me to be at the heart of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists were supposed to gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there until renovation there was a musical-artistic club for Bohemia, the house of St. Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Cord got there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Cord and his friends sang simple songs for the play-back, wore tight jerseys and among them was today's hip composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have its origin in the art clinic.
Our employees and regular guests went there.
I'm a hero of the past century when culture meant something else.
In 2000, there was a poll in the press about the award "Personalities of Our City".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and that brought me to the climax.
It is not easy to work according to old rules in new times; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In modern times it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my paintings are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and scares me to be like that.
In a clown, all this blurs and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and orients himself on the outside and not on the inside of the human being.
But maybe you shouldn't give a man your hand, but you should spit in his face.
The deception disappears by dressing up.
Recently, we saw you in the role of the city's organ player.
Who if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved the one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communitys, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- But the performances of Stas Michailov are attended by several thousand!
- To him come abandoned women, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons 300 people come and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and everything is going to perish.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I painted such paintings, which even hung with a collector in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of the career.
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
It means: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, it's something completely different.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
That is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: servants of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real tsars, because the tsars might not understand much of culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are good advisors in Moscow at the moment.
In Petersburg, we have some that could be experts, but they are being blocked, as there is a need for higher-ranking experts to properly assess the former and clear the way for them.
Now all that matters is your own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and that some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the Capital of Culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
Art can hardly grow on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us, that's much less.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by grants from the city of St. Petersburg
Birth in Space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth dwellers on board are searching for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the important question arises as to how we can reproduce in weightlessness or on the substitute planet?
I do not think there are many choices.
De facto, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"In other words, Mars and Venus," says the research associate of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, the surface of Venus has a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The researchers first discussed the question of reproduction in space in terms of flora.
Experiments with plants were already carried out half a century before.
The fourth generation of peas bred in orbit did not differ in the least from the terrestrial species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely tiny fruit flies (drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent into space to investigate the effect of weightlessness on embryo development.
A normal chick develops.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick must find a hold; it must be able to stand on its feet and begin to move," explains the laboratory manager of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychev.
Without a solid underground, the chicks wildly overturned.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely dulled.
The chicks did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later, they simply died.
"We let chicks hatch twice and then set the whole thing up because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sykhev notes for the failed experiment with chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, only same-sex species will be present on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special was noted.
"It was just with the biosatellites, but again it was only a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," Vladimir Sykhev notes.
After the landing, the space rats got offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, man could do that in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was with Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Does it survive space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question," says Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andriyan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was in orbit twice and even did work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, there is still a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is, even on flights into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, a hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet humanity must search for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory in the cosmonaut preparation centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a floating state, the cosmonauts gain routine for working in open space.
The water represents weightlessness.
Even if adults feel that water is pleasant, it is a foreign environment, but infants feel that water is a natural element.
It's like the little Ichtyanders testify that life on the land escaped from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the womb of the mother in amniotic fluid for about 9 months and the fact that it can easily get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth until the first swim only two weeks pass.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
While weightlessness is a much more natural condition for a newborn child, the woman does not survive without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles are rapidly receding and thus the ability to push the child out decreases.
All right, let's avoid this with birth-inducing aids.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to push the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Valeri Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the gravity of the earth, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a strain suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is of fundamental importance for his life.
"This experiment, which we are undertaking together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the birth of a disabled person, a completely unadapted person," predicts Igor Pestov, head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
Eventually, however, it becomes a reality when the Earth's inhabitants set off in their spaceships to a distant planet that becomes the home of their offspring born in space.
NKÚ Chief: Control of the black system fails due to political fault
The Czech Republic has good supervisory authorities and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but falls back on their application.
In a conversation for Aktuálně.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvy
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I do not think this is the case with us," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practical example, he cites the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass businessmen with controls - is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then it is not easy for the head of the government to come, and the control office, whose duty is to check compliance with the law, to hinder its activity," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries concerning public contracts were compared.
What exactly was that all about?
This is a parallel test that we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, it is a question of the European legislature defining how public contracts are to be handled, on which national legislation builds, and finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all of this with each other, and although the test has not yet been completed, we have been able to see very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even more "strict and perfect", but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more precise rules over and over again, and it is also necessary to look at the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What does this project mean to you?
It is precisely such joint control that could help us to stop constantly trying to perfect laws and reduce and balance thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Cost-effectiveness means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will achieve this objective.
Perhaps it is even the case that in this way we are only burdening the system with excessive "paperwork", and those who are looking for gaps in the system have much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
You are talking about the problems of the practical implementation of the Czech Public Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority to our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is structured in a similar way to ours and also has a college, which is only slightly different. However, in principle both authorities work in a similar way.
The competences are also to some extent comparable, although Germany is a federal state, i.e. there are also these accounting offices in the individual federal states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The Federal Government can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds, which are managed by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the state accounting courts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would hate to compare this without concrete information. Nevertheless, Germany is often described as a role model in some respects, but one certainly cannot say that Germany is better in everything.
Is that because the examiners are better there?
This is certainly not the case, but as I said, I do not like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are a model for us also face problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have anything of cooperation with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, how important was the amendment of the Procurement Act for your authority, do you already feel any effects?
In view of the fact that this amendment is only in force for a short time, it has not yet had any effect on our tests.
Since our controls are carried out retrospectively, we have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, we have had more impact in the preparation phase of future controls - we have introduced the new control tool "Recognition of risks of inefficiency" and with this almost 14,000 public contracts have been examined and analysed - here, the changes will naturally have an impact, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "more stringent" and can no longer be complied with.
Under the previous rules, the persons subject to an audit vis-à-vis the institution (e.g. in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) are accountable in such a way that any non-compliance with the procurement law is equivalent to a breach of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to tighten up the law?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system only puts even greater pressure on bureaucracy.
Where's the way out?
First of all, let us say which path is not effective.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with checks on the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now forbidden or allowed?
A law must be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then it is not easy for the chairman of the government to come, and the control office, whose duty is to monitor compliance with the law, to hinder its activities.
He can say, "We're changing the law and allowing things to happen," but he can't say that we're pretending to be nothing.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and this is also correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best bid is excluded solely because of formal errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and that is what I believe is lacking in us.
On the roads there is occasional ice ice, but mostly they are dry.
On the roads of the Czech Republic there is partly snow and ice smoothness.
However, the roads are mostly well passable, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlovy Vary
In the district of Karlovy Vary, the roads were well passable this morning, and snow and ice ice ice was scattered.
The temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should get a little warmer.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
However, there are about 30 cm of snow on the ridges of the Erzgebirge.
According to the district road guard, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 expressway and the first-class roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges where the roads are sometimes icy and smooth.
All roads of the second and third road classes, including the mountain roads, are also passable.
On these roads, however, partial icy or extended snow remains remain.
Increased attention is therefore needed, especially in the higher areas.
Districts of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads in East Bohemia there is a danger because of icy ice, in higher altitudes and in the mountains there is sometimes still an extended layer of snow on the roads, the road and highway direction communicates on their Internet pages.
The majority of the roads warn drivers of ice ice, which can occur in particular in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
It is possible to reach ice-smooth roads in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is especially found on the roads of the Giant Mountains and the Orlické Hory Mountains.
An extended layer of snow lies at altitudes on the streets of the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia it is mostly sunny or cheerful today, and it remains largely free of precipitation.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen District
The streets in the Pilsen district are now easily accessible, but local attention needs to be increased, and the driving style needs to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures subsequently fell, it can come to ice on the streets.
Local fog is also to be expected, but visibility will improve during the day.
These data are taken from the district highways.
The D5 motorway is practically fully navigable, but increased attention is recommended by the majority of the roads between the 80th and 131st kilometers.
The lanes of the first road class are mainly dry, but frozen.
However, in the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov there can be some ice smoothness.
The lanes of the second and third road classes are damp, and therefore the indication of possible icy sections applies here as well.
Drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc District
Today, drivers who are heading towards the altitudes in the district of Olomouc have to reckon with snow slick.
After the use of stray vehicles, snow mash remains on the Červenohorské sedlo pass and on the road towards Videlský k
By night snow drove the majority of the roads to use, in the circle Šumperk fell according to the street administration about 3 cm of fresh snow.
In the other areas of the district, the carriageways are usually fully accessible.
"In the Šumperk district, snow remains remain in the altitudes.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers in the direction of Jeseník have to reckon with snow-mash", said a staff member of the Šumperk Road Administration today to the agency ČTK.
Her colleagues in Jeseník County also had to leave at night, and according to her data, the roads are free and wet until the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district the roads are fully accessible, but in the Šternberk district the drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads are still wet.
District of Ústí nad Labem, Liberec district
In northern Bohemia, the majority of the roads report several poorly passable sections of the road.
The road from Telnice to Knínice in Ústí n.K. is closed, according to the traffic police.
The temperatures remain below zero even in deeper locations, so that snow and ice will stay on the roads. No problems are reported from the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, and the roads there are usually dry.
So far no traffic disturbances have been reported.
Ice smoothness is reported in particular from the Štětí area.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night cloudless sky and frost.
The main routes and road I/13 on the border of the Ústí n.L. and Liberec districts report poor traffic conditions.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to branches that were pushed from the snow load to the roadway.
Simon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at our concerts
What do you think about the end of the world taking place in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports that we people like to jump at.
With our band The Tap Tap, we rather make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
It's a nationwide benefit event that we've been planning for two years.
For this purpose, we want to exploit the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which is forecast to end at 11:10 a.m. on December 21st.
The day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava at the same time from 21:00.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be about the time that the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific Island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who gave you this idea?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think with the public about the state in which we are going to hand this world over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key rings against the end of the world, with which people can also support us through www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers, also recorded the so-called hymn against the end of the world entitled "Weltuntergang gefalls aus".
The anthem on YouTube is already very popular today. Will it also be performed at the benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, provided that everything works and the end of the world doesn't happen...
The hymn will be sung simultaneously by all performers at all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns will be broadcast live together in a direct connection from Czech television.
The lyrics of the hymn are by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many charity events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
This has shown that most people are interested in working with us and have fun with it.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo, which we have been working on for six years together with the association Tap in the Jedlička Institute.
Students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building is to be built, into which we then move in with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers perform.
What criteria have you chosen these?
We wanted to put together a program that addresses all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere perform with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You can find everything else on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "large events" planned for the future?
In May we perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and for this concert we also prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the USA then - would also like to combine this with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs have to be transported in the luggage compartment. We also have to carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked so far without problems, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I sometimes wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your trips abroad you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than we do, we witnessed in Russia that everything is still in its beginnings in the East.
Opposite Prague, Moscow is absolutely not accessible for disabled people. It is still unusual there when someone is travelling in a wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even a matter of course that a wheelchair user is allowed in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still hanging behind...
However, it should be noted that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public spaces, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not exactly common for a larger group of disabled people to participate actively in social events there, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time I started as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intense.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone, among other things, I founded a music group together with a colleague.
Well, and with time, as our presenter, L’a Angelovič, tends to say, something gets out of control (laughs).
But the band only became known in recent years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that working with well-known singers has helped us; we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that when you do something and you cannot see it outwardly, your own performance does not exist in a sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford good proofreaders, high-quality equipment and the like.
Was it your goal to get this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that things could be dealt with differently.
In show business, one often copies the other today.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after a long time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is, of course, pity; this is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
It is people who can live and develop a full life if they have the necessary means.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed something, it is not just progress for themselves, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something well, you must not compromise on many things and must also demand a certain discipline.
However, I think that this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic performances, and when they find that they have to have rehearsals twice a week, have preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, the enthusiasm of many quickly fades out.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them were there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: La Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop that.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Takes place the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday the 20.12.2012 at 21 o'clock
Venues are: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues will be connected to each other via live circuit and a joint interpretation of the anthem "Weltuntergang gefallen" by the band The Tap Tap will be heard.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the provision of a multi-functional educational centre for disabled people, which is to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost: CZK 25 million
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland became the twentieth member of this space agency at a Council of Ministers meeting of the member states of the European Space Agency. Poland is thus the second member country from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland started a close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland’s way into space, of course, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts engaged in space travel, not always coming to terms with it.
I recall, for example, the lecture given by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important supporter of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's world-renowned contribution to the development of space travel was recognized by the fact that one of the craters on the earth-averse side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925 a railway drain was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or brake the draisine.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered missiles.
The research was carried out by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It can be seen from the documents handed down that research had progressed to the stage of practical testing.
However, research was interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937 there appeared in the specialist press the design of a photoelectric hunting rocket by Ing. Rohoziński, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work his work was terminated from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel were published in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this society takes place in 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in which four extensive articles are devoted to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space society.
At the time, there were already the first satellite technology projects, and it was foreseeable that space exploration would have a future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish space company PTA sought to join the International Federation of Spaceflight, founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a full member already in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-chairman of the International Federation of Space.
He held this post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has played a major role in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959, flight tests with the two-stage rocket RM-2 began in the desert.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach a flight altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of high-altitude winds.
In 1962, however, the further development was stopped.
The first RM rockets were developed between 1962 and 1965, and were replaced by the first RM rockets.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space with 0.4 liters capacity, Meteor-1B with 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C with 0.62 liters.
The maximum altitude for all three types was 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968 the Meteor 2 rocket was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
After that, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which was followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the law on non-profit is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the law on charitable work.
This decision led to a lively public debate.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
Liberalised economies in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that individual economies are in constant conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages), price tensions occur.
This term refers to a situation in which the producer tries to compete economically by importing cheap goods by "undercutting" the competition in order to gain a greater market share and increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies moving their production abroad or buying it cheaply, or abandoning their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, public expenditure is necessarily increasing.
This situation is compounded by the fact that the gentlemen of business are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus to compensate for the overall social and economic damage they cause.
This situation is well known, so concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population to private capital without regard to the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in changes to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force their own population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done through economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment, and through the curtailment of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, for some years now, there have been public food delivery centres for poor people who are no longer able to feed on their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases in which workers receive such a low wage that the state must increase their income to a minimum.
Such a scandal was also revealed in the case of auxiliary workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all the EU's southern states will undoubtedly lead to the same situation in which people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or to pay for hunger on the fringes of society under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in their social level, hoping that private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
This naturally raises the question of where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or Africa, the workers work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim until the end of the day that the state must not participate in its own economy with capital, and that planned economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists closely on its position that the state must not intervene in the economy as a directing factor.
But then you have to ask yourself whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually all-powerful lobby that is omnipresent in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual pre-division, legislation in which virtually everything is arduous, but nothing punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a state ministry, in the absence of finances, entrusts private legal firms closely intertwined with industry with the preparation of draft laws.
These draft laws will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence will then no longer emanate from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies are rapidly coming into a situation, as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompeius: "The state had long been in decline, and the offices were occupied by violence.
For bribes, by unlawful concealment of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption was rampant, and the people went to the election with already bought votes" ... "People with character did not apply for offices, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "One really began to talk about the only medicine in this difficult situation being a sole rule, and that a strong man had to be elected" ... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with sole rule.
As it turns out, today's society, as in ancient times, is based on the ruthless preference of one's own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
By its very nature, private capital is not in a position to recognise and enforce the advantage for society as a whole.
The result, today as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not trying in the least for deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's point of view, the demise of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause in which the next round is already looming.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites face the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them from old and newer history, in total ignorance.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution here, at least not a lasting solution.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to lower the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state's participation in the economy, increase citizens' influence on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is: "...so that we do not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there was a huge number of reactions.
Some are behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while others call the Palestinians terrorists; the others, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State of Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is guilty and victim in these ever-recurring waves of killing; in the end, the people of Israel today, including the self-government areas, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of the violence itself.
It is my intention to open the reader's eyes behind the scenes, to look at who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small village of Land in the Middle East are primarily useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and emerge from my own understanding of who or which group of people has a decisive influence on the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is first and foremost a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make out an Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
That which is less obvious is the question whether it was really always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the lifetime of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families one stands out especially, which could be called the head of the octopus (I do not know if anyone is standing above them, but I do not exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
There's not much written about her.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was already bought by the Rothschilds in the 1990s in order to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which was always the consolidation of their power, the increase of their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or prepare themselves for them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafi only four left, while Russia has in the meantime subordinated its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay for it with life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank, began issuing his own (i.e., state) banknotes during the civil war, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; the MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the FED for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the global lusts for power of the Rothschilds led to the formulation of a plan for the unleashing of three world wars by Albert Pik, a Mason of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge.
The first war aimed to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was to break the colonial rule of Great Britain in particular, and the third war was to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide its amenities and luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (the ecumenism here is nothing more than the apron) and ultimately lead to the assumption of absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see FED's founding, so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not happen again).
After they succeeded in triggering the First World War by the murder of Ferdinand, heir to the Habsburg throne in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian tsarist empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian tsarist empire the war was no longer necessary), followed by the dissolution of the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to make the Second World War easier to spark, the bankers had politics create a latent conflict situation by imposing gigantic war reparations on Germany, thereby creating the pre-conditions for impoverished masses, so that they had to subjugate the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader, who offered the guilty and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to take up the function of a fifth column and also took over to spark the war conflagration.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The previously mentioned Balfour Declaration provided the basis for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine; first clashes with the local Arab population occurred.
Terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke away from the chain where the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything was going according to plan, it is difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war reparations against Germany prepared the ground for the Second World War, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will become victims in the front line, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East, as in the Second World War.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharply people divide into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israel, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their quest for global power at the beginning?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, since the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, exclusively choose their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the falcon Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist-prone politician loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything in his power to spark a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could rapidly expand into a global conflict, and which could lead to the destruction of the world economy due to Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormus, over which 20% of the world's oil supplies run.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their imagination, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocracy.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth a chip to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants, all of them to give themselves a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, that no one can buy or sell, except that he has the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of its name.
Here is wisdom! Whoever has understanding, consider the number of the beast.
For there is a man's number, and his number is six hundred sixty-six."
The film Argo: When it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of protesting Islamist students occupied the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had maintained the patronage of his regime for decades.
For the American government, there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have seriously damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to release the hostages only made things worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The Iran debacle contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the USA a small partial victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six embassy staff managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get the refugees out of Iran, helping them to cover up their true identity with an extravagant story - they traveled disguised with Canadian passports as members of a film staff who allegedly visited filming locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required the collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the cover credible, articles about this film project appeared in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time, based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful hussar play such as the movie Ocean's Eleven.
Thus, the levels of mood alternate in the film - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no big differences in the film version of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood that come ironically and slightly exaggerated.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the official floor, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable reboot of his career with this film.
A smiled actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor he is no longer the goal of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime novel Kein Kinderschuss (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller Stadt ohne Gnade (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film that doesn't play in the director's home Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that the director's previous films took from Hollywood's standard.
However, Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the opening sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet it conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when history moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team also achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (the false film wand on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story actually doesn't offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
However, he works quite successfully with the few, sometimes helping with reality - which does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted from a telephone call in America, or the chase on the runway, seem a bit artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its overly wide dispersion, due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserve more space, and thus they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film loses some of its pull. It’s a film that you can follow with a certain interest, while gouting the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th year.
However, it is difficult to arouse enthusiasm.
However, it is sufficient as a reminder of a piece of history still alive in a certain way and as proof of how exaggerated the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are.
Guidelines for the inflating of balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which calls an annual survey of the most absurd bank fees, has decided this year to organise the competition "Absurdest regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This idea was inspired by the EU's recent plan to introduce a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organising this survey, to the Právo newspaper.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, is the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance tariffs for men and women.
Until then, women had an advantage in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk to insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013", informed Nacher.
The controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the mandatory incorporation of bioethanol into fuels, which are subsequently harmful to nature, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs much more expensive this year.
Criticism in the past also won the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU Apparat often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more member states (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks with veto threats).
Lobby interests were also based on the fact that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curvature anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it only harmonises the inconsistent national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries, indicating that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which according to balloons must be provided with the indication on sale that children under eight years of age are not allowed to inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred to an American study which, according to balloons, is the leading cause of child suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using fairgrounds.
Curious ideas can also be found at home
A directive that affects European officials themselves is also relatively absurd - anyone who has an official role in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) instead.
In cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated not only the above absurdities but also the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a member country.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks that could be found in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume for preserved mushrooms, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organisers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should get money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving funding for applications for funding.
These ideas, of course, did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will apply to the EU for reimbursement," said Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued that the grain harvest was very high and that the state stocks were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
Finally, the European Commission approached the Czech Republic to organise a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU) offered the municipalities funding for applications for funding, in concrete terms this should be funding for the creation of funding applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations are easily the target of criticism in the Member States, some experts believe that the EU's efforts to regulate, and hence the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole, deserve more recognition.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects which have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which were forced by individual Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
Emotions in this country also evoke the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
After a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvar.'ky", the "Tuzemský rum", whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename "Tuzemák".
The term rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
The official list of products registered in the EU now includes Carlsbader Zwieback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or Saazer hops, in the company of world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham.
With an EU brand, the Pardubice gingerbread or the Hořicer rolls can boast.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I wouldn't run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the Republic being plundered for 20 years, thieves walking around freely, while people are getting tax and retirement age increased.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I do not like, I try to propose a solution to change it.
And since I'm already over 40, independent and impartial, I have no other way of influencing things than running for the office of senator or president.
You made it to the Senate and then immediately set off for the castle.
Don't you turn your back on your voters?
I've been telling myself all along that I'm going to start the fight for the castle after the Senate elections.
Later, I specified this and said that I would run for president if I was elected senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people, scold in the pub and in front of the TV, but that we destroy anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, there are the media that want to rob you of honor and that confuse the freedom of the word with freedom.
About me, for example, it was claimed that I would bribe journalists or that I was an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You took up the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive declarations of assets over 20 million kroner.
You'll have to change the law.
As President, you have no authority in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring forward legislative proposals.
How do you intend to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have worked to ensure that the travel guide remains a free trade, and this has been enforced.
The problem is petty-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent partyless, I have much greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from any party what is best for our country, without the idea of a drawer and a party dogma.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather right or left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people tend to see me on the left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is not important.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It is not about whether someone belongs to the left or right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't like someone calling you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that's what you want to approach.
This can be called populism because of me, but all the proposals I have mentioned are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you only have keywords.
And that's not going to get you far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk to people long enough, you will be able to enforce, for example, material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to put them on our side in order to achieve these goals.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to call on the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to legislate on material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And if so, they would have to say why they refuse to do so.
A strong personality that points to grievances can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I can't achieve anything on my own; so I talked to several well-known personalities about whether they would also like to run for the Senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who refused because of work overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy on the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm not sure.
Sixty percent of those entitled to vote did not go to the elections at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we're just two independents.
People have chosen such a senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and district governors.
Are you thinking about founding your own party?
I haven't thought about that yet, because I don't have time to review the past of every potential party member, and I don't even have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; there's only CZK 20,000 on my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset statements, what would yours look like?
I estimate my private assets to be about CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb that is worth about a million, and then I have a few million in the account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a children's dream - I always liked James Bond driving in the car, being gallant to women, and at the same time fighting against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have a fortune of 60 million and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
You want me to make a debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't attract too much interest.
And I am not obliged to contest the campaign by my own means.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live on the senator's salary alone; for example, I couldn't finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So you're still working as an entrepreneur to get your living out?
Didn't you say you were going to go back to these activities?
But that's not related to the amount of the salary.
As promised, I partially rescinded my activities.
For example, my deputy will become the manager of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that continues to be the case.
As President, however, I would completely cease my operations.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in the mind - using the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Büchenberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large-scale company, says, "Yes, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes to one of those old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy city hardly in need of sightseeing at the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The municipality of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid circumstance, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro banknotes as nicely pinsed reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master statistics: a library must come!
Winy Maas of Rotterdam's architecture firm MVRDV, master of bold bar charts and producer of witty, often cynical buildings, took the matter with familiar serenity and appeared for the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin in his face.
And while the jury was still staggering around and twitching with the armpits, the cheeky Maas piled his exquisite souvenirs to a pyramid by size and finished his actionistly supported speech with the words: "Dear Town Community!"
So this is him, my proposal for the Buchenberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is poured out.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Büchenberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This makes the faceless small town retorte, which so far had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Bucheldorado under cheese bell.
There is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, but the true pleasures of space and reading open up during the walking climb of topography.
The completely glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lamps clearly speak the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You are already looking for park bench, dog and soccer playing boys and girls.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally, the bookshelfs stand along the façade, and in the middle lies a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic room configuration upside down and turned the reading area from inside to outside.
The inside of the Buchenberg is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and building technology center.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall covering, sometimes balustrade, sometimes stair railings.
Optics, feel and smell are foreign.
Even ingrained architects and civil engineers shake the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so one day we found a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Frisian farm.
For many years, a mm-thin plastic fleece has been used as a root pad in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts one or two seasons, after which it is ripe for bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece was pressed to a thickness of four centimetres for the first time in these quantities.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, load-bearing material that smells a bit of new cars and a bit of sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre-long hiking tour, the Literaturcafé is not only rewarded with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They provide an atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a flagship project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heat and cool with geothermal energy.
Although the Buchenberg is under a glass lintel, even on sunny days the sun shines only briefly into the interior.
The wide wood bindings, which stand across to the glass façade, serve as shading and capture most of the sunlight.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest are fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptic from the IT industry, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "long overdue soul".
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal inventory.
For the time being, the optical gaps in the library - currently 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept has come to an end.
The shelves are filled to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just an ornament.
Thus, MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline, which is called in the specialist jargon identity foundation.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in US-European relations, Berlin is balancing it to a narrow diplomatic degree.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the request for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Does Germany find it difficult to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is changing its foreign policy, away from a policy that has been managed, so to speak, by the US, towards a German foreign policy.
What is more, Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans thus find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe they are still approaching their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as France or Great Britain.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
Therefore, it must be careful not to push the public, but also the elites, into the heads of Arab countries.
It definitely does matter.
But I wouldn't want to give too much weight to this either, that's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great deal of understanding for the German position in Europe and even in the USA.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even show some respect for it.
After all, it signals that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, has clearly declared itself in favour of veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly has quite a lot of understanding for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, publicly represent this position.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as great as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu's politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree on its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a bit easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can't be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player - does Germany want to play a leading role?
Or is it still difficult for Germany to lead?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes on a greater role, various anti-German feelings become free.
It doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be receptive to a wide range of neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now the US's influence in European politics is steadily diminishing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, they are uncomfortable and make them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!
Stephen Szabo is the Deputy Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, where academics and policy experts from Europe and North America work together on the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specializes in German politics, US foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Trademark protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this lies a name officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the original companies.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection for as long as the actual namesakes do not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether they are right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, attorney at Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in IPR violations in the Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
A few additional letters are enough for the imitators to register their brands.
So Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have Prada Kny entered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the Trade Mark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected there, an art name that was also used at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: on behalf of his clients, he takes the view that Chinese companies are officially given the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
That means women fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is business-damaging, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is diluted, the unique position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and process costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest luxury goods market with a volume of 15 billion euros a year and the fastest growing.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into money.
Up to nine years the procedure may be delayed, with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports on cases in which the court dismissed actions because, after the long duration of the contested name, it had become "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he even has to pay the plagiarist money for violating his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Famous cases also affect graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore still allowed to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo that reminded of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
Fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore who made the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to insufficient personnel and space equipment.
Last year, however, one had returned from the "emergency situation in the work process to normality".
The number of unprocessed opposition proceedings had fallen by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 appeals are still pending in the office.
To counter this, it costs a lot
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row, China is leading the list of new customers around the world, the authorities say.
This also applies to the inventory of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were collected.
Simplified means that every registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
In contrast, it costs a multiple, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitation automotive parts was removed.
But the imitator continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
They themselves failed to do so, as family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trade mark office rejected the Munich opposition.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got right, but the opponent of the trial continues to fight today.
You have to be infernally careful
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archive even had to look through one hundred-year-old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite side a "high six-digit euro amount" in vain for settlement.
"This shows how much it is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to fall back to Europe.
Then, when imitators secure unprotected brands there.
Thus a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since abandoned this field of business, but was nevertheless able to avert registration.
"You have to be infernal," says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but rather "all that is worth protecting should also register in China", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact: If Freudenberg is subject to the last act of his trademark drama, then one would have to pay royalties for one's own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are being pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Aid Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir rehearses Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The story of a connection that spans far more than 8733 kilometres.
First of all, there's stomping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' pumps and men's slippers look for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly swell - old, bass, tenor and soprano - press, beguile and follow each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his supple wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers are between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choir voice has a different text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self - Help
Worldwide, there are about 34 million people infected with HIV, estimated by Unaids, the United Nations program for the eradication of AIDS.
23.5 million people live in the south of Africa.
There are 245000 orphans living in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni.
70 of them attend secondary school.
You can sponsor for 15 or 20 euros a month.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a warm meal daily at the Gogo Center.
On Zulu, Imbongi means storytellers or praisers.
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign, soft language and sometimes brings them back to where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometres as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voice power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud huts and straw huts, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni, we can see in a small way what all of Swaziland is suffering from: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly assumed by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus within themselves, dying at the middle of thirty is not uncommon.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
If you don't graduate, you don't have a chance in a poor country.
At first, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and enable him to have a warm meal a day.
A year later, however, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has since taken almost professional care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papsilomaviruses, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Creepy lice and scabies are parasitic STIs.
Who are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and trippers are especially common among men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonaden, candidiasis (fungal), trippers and human papsilomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - nevertheless: about 20 percent of the HIV new infections are attributable to this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur much more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged between 15 and 25.
Human papsilomaviruses are also common in adolescents in Germany.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections more than doubled from 1697 in 2001 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 2700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate an STD?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, urination, discharge, abdominal pain and blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
In part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubricating infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations especially in frequently changing sex partners.
Most STIs can be diagnosed early and late consequences can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and last but not least the gages that the choir sings throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
"Overall, we have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans stay well with one of the grandmothers, for example.
The Gogos, as they call the old women on Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear every day in time for school lessons.
If you have no one left, you will come to the shelter of Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association as much as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have had an HIV test done.
This is not a matter of course, because, as obviously the disease is throughout the country, you prefer to keep it silent.
A King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned form of life that the HI virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms are available at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels every two or three years together through the south of Africa and sings songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many still know at the southern tip of the black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites who sing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has also already defied some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The trip always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if you hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light," say the people there.
And if you return the 8733 kilometers as the crow flies to Heidelberg, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, then you can see it shining there as well.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters thick and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that hit Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have come to other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth's citizens, probes, telescopes, and small robots such as Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small peepholes in infinite widths.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This section of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: The oldest stars can be seen as blue dots, the pink "newborns" in the star circle room are harder to identify.
This star-forming region - called by scientists unromantic W5 - has discovered the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This shimmering glow of a dying star has captured the Spitzer telescope of the Nasa.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star ejected during the death process.
In the giant trifid nebula, 5400 light-years from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
The Spitzer telescope of the Nasa took this photo of the galactic birth room.
The Pleiades cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better used.
Like a red Age, the Helix nebula looks forward to the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light-years away in the Aquarius star image.
Its similarity to an earthly continent brought this nebula the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular coloration.
This baby star could only be captured in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How these evolved is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps they are the remains of a Saturnian moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color scheme, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (tripartite, tripartite), because dark dust strips divide the glowing heart of the star-birthplace.
In the constellation Snake Bearers, astronomers have photographed the harbingers of a cosmic karambolage: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies race towards each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't have technical shortcuts, you may call them Southern Wheel of Fire by their nickname.
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a section of the iris nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The fog, which is 1400 light-years away, consists of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded the Hubble Space Telescope for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy is called scientist UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The starry cradle always produces new youngsters.
Also this star cloud, connected with the rosette nebula, constantly brings forth new baby stars - 5000 light-years away from the earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was created shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was predominantly found in the universe.
Our insights into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become bigger and bigger - and the insights they provide have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
Arizona, U.S.A., is home to the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows glances into space just above two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable design: The telescope is lashed at its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
Its special feature: the high light collecting power.
Despite comparatively small mirror diameters, this is close to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which pays tribute to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO's Chilean observatory.
Its main mirror is supposed to cover 42 meters - and be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which looks up to the sky next to them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
However, the Hubble Space Telescope provides the most important impressions from space.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been delivering images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets - primarily those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planetary candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
The last preparations for launch at the Kepler space telescope are documented in the picture.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space at the earliest in 2018 on board an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that ice also exists at the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the Messengers circle far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
With the Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to circle around Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day - and become 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The ride through the Talysch Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles across the winding road, past densely wooded hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you'd be in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysh, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Azerbaijani and is very durable.
End of the line is Lerik.
The small town is boasting too much architecture from Soviet times, which does not even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the approach from Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, because the road is only one lane.
The legendary wealth that the land owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to attract tourists.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the vita of about eight dozen talyshes from the area older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years still a child conceived
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is said to have become 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person who became 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in 1805 in the region, and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he was said to have had another daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov charge himself for a few decades at his age?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, an old-age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the elderly in Central Asia.
"A striking number of high-age people also exist in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of documentation, no scientific evidence of age should be provided, especially as civil status registers were missing.
Each day cup by cup melted butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik are strikingly often reaching a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over the age of 100.
So why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is due to the diet.
However, the fact that the high calorie diet of the Talyshes should be so healthy that they love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day does not seem plausible from a nutritional point of view either.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the city of Lerik.
With her 97 years she is still comparatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel that untiringly rolls her back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, both of whom are grandparents.
Also two toddlers jump around.
In the kitchen guests are prepared tea, which is served in the typical, bulbous Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand perfectly in line, under her headscarf she hides long, dark-blonde braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I haven't bought food at the supermarket once.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
The worst was in the period after World War II.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the rudder.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows hardly borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's old people.
230 manats (about the same sum in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount from which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-grayed son is also right: "The old enjoy high regard in our culture."
They live in the middle of the extended family, are loved, cared for and happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with the Sharia as the basis is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, in front of the people and in front of God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because all of them, hopelessly divided in a confused opposition so far, are afraid.
Fear of a god-state on the Nile by graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
According to Mohammed Morsi, he had almost excused the fact that he had temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, about that the Egyptians are aware, the world is not quite clear.
Should the judiciary be deprived of its powers?
Indeed, the 234 articles whipped through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member constitutional assembly in a nightly, 15-hour Parforce ride are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and there is a fear that the Islamists will use the spongy formulation and the accompanying legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of Shariah.
This is at least suggested by a newly added article: In all matters relating to Sharia, Al-Ashar University must be consulted, the country's most important Islamic institution with great radiance throughout Sunni Islam.
This does not have to, but it can mean that the clergy supervise the legislation, which would de facto lead to the disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
Much of the draft is a matter of interpretation
It is also problematic: civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's reign to suppress oppositionists.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military custody.
According to the draft, the state should also "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote their morality and values".
This is so vaguely formulated legally that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In plain language, that means nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
For this, another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how to punish it remains unclear.
Equally dubious is the wording that "insulting people" is forbidden.
Is there enough to caricature the president or joke at the expense of a lawyer?
The question of interpretation, such as so much in the draft that Mursi has to sign and, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for the referendum.
"The Revolution Has Returned"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the superpower of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual concord on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring down the Charter even before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placer in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the draft constitution belongs "on the garbage mountain of history".
Via Twitter, he accused the followers of Mursis of wanting to lead a "putsch against democracy".
"When he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said oppositionist Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not atoned for," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew to the régime demonstration, but for the sake of precaution not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and Salafists took part and shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Morsi: "Clean the land!" and affirmed: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the emblematic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have conjured up conditions similar to civil war.
Clearly, Mursi’s followers did not want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the Islamists' draft is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which should have been going until February and involving all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison under Mubarak or in court.
Not because he would share their world view, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "world on Sunday".
Morsi extended power to all three powers in the state made the lawyer resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto overrides it," Saeda laments.
But without civil society organisations, democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle for direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could get revenge.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns, "You are feeding a monster that you can't control anymore."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most smelly fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the country’s secret of success have anything to do with the local appetite for rather bad-smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sportswear.
And leave her there for a week.
This is how you have to imagine the nascent smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air, which simply does not want to disappear.
Rakfisk is a trout sprinkled with salt, which is fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how smelly you would like your fish to be.
When the darkness comes across the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this, now, really very captivating specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but also hosts the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk General."
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," Havard says.
The spirit can displace the smell.
I'll have some snacks.
If you avoid bringing the Rakfisk near the nose, it is not bad - like Sushi, who has a quite long bus ride behind you.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling possibilities yet and fish was soaked in airtight salt water barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter it was then taken out after long fermentation and - undoubtedly with the help of alcohol-muffled senses - consumed.
Even a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrated mainly to the USA.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival who was much richer than Norway not too long ago, immigrants flock.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - an essential, if strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But everything is really expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often make it to the world press, and most people don't seem to mind.
Here you still hate to name Anders Breivik - the racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, we refer only to the July 22 incident.
Norwegians are struggling to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, Norway's wealth has been largely responsible for the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round trays with mature Rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes.
We are - as they say - a prudent people.
Your English is spotless, just like most people here.
We're not very showy, we don't like boasting.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the industry's income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the Great Depression, when everyone threw money that they did not own, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat Rakfisk," she adds with carefree laughter.
I'm standing in the snow and standing up for another court - I've had enough of Rakfisk.
Such an elk burger is definitely something else.
But in the evening the skunkfish is on the menu again.
The hotel, where I logique, is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the sense of smell the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-clad showmaster surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict haze of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's future president, Enrique Pena Nieto, is preparing to take office, Will Grant of the BBC analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly poor.
Even on better days, this is an ever-congested city, but on Monday a steel ring was built that shuts down several important traffic routes to the capital and causes chaos on the streets.
However, the aim was not to disturb commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will be given the presidency and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a complex task.
Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well under the divisive government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is under the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before going on an equal footing with the US president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, extensive part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A Direct Man
For example, in the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, people like to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to it development of tourism and construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, one can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built and which represent a great improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plates with his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him to make real and lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nietos Party, the PRI.
In particular, with regard to security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejected the opposition's accusations that the new president lacked substance.
He was a very direct man, very committed and had great plans for the country.
He was an outstanding statesman, but above all he was also someone who could listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The town is hidden under highway overpasses and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was engaged to combat drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
The bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind in the last two years alone on a village of wasteland near a large landfill.
During Governor Pena Nieto's term of office, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that even surpasses that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not addressed the problem of women's murder properly during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government had closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears as she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was being beaten, and the body rigidity had already begun.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is placed next to a cross bearing a single word: justice.
But she has been denied this, according to the family, until now.
The authorities treated me as if I were a chatterer, a troublemaker, a nag.
They want their judgment to be easily accepted and their mouths shut.
"But this is not possible if there were so many formal errors and omissions," she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential tie on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes in the last six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this issue during his term of office.
"I hope as president he is the way he was governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is precisely what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
The Procuratorate Claims: Bradley Manning Has Not Complained About Mistreatment
The Procuratorate contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations that he was abused in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense aims to dismiss the charges on the grounds of too harsh detention conditions
The Private of the US Army is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents
The prosecution tried on Friday to find out that the army-liberated Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information in US history - missed several occasions to complain about the abuse he allegedly suffered in military custody.
During a cross-examination of Manning during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that documents relating to weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month term in Quantico, Virginia had no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held following a request by the defense to dismiss the charges - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard time in prison - Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein went through the forms with Manning, which officials had filled out after their meetings with Manning during his detention in the Quantico Military Prison, where he had been detained under increased prison conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the facility as "very professional".
According to Fein, the forms did not contain any complaints about maltreatment, although officers had interviewed Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they had dealt with them, but they had not been recorded.
"They wrote down (after discussing the concerns) "No problems," and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he had mentioned a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to have his observation status downgraded to "prevention of injuries".
The military declared that it had assigned him this restrictive status - which is one stage under the risk of suicide - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and to get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Marine Base prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he had considered suicide and had once fainted due to the heat.
Not knowing what was happening to him or to the outside world was a burden.
"My world shrunk to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without company.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said that he had tried to keep moving, because it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
He always had to sleep with light that penetrated his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and guards couldn't see his face, they woke him up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Manning.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the Fort Leavenworth Military Prison, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep one night naked in his cell in Quantico and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners during a morning count.
Manning had testified that during this count he had never had the opportunity to wrap himself with his blanket.
During the interview on Friday, Manning stated that he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should have dropped the blanket with which he could have covered himself. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to.
On Thursday, Manning had testified that the previous night he was forced to sleep naked. He had previously tried to show an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the officer that he could have used the waistband of his underpants or flip-flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his prison experiences and drastically reduce his prison sentence if he is sentenced to trial before the military court, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to minor offenses, while other charges considered too extreme are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to justify the terms of detention.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the regulations applicable to all prisoners under the highest security precautions in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include favoring the enemy, illegal publication of intelligence information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all counts, he is threatened with a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the emigrants - they remind them of difficult times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when perplexity spread within me.
Signs refered to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of which one I should go to.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexican" all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later, I chose Mexican-American.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I don't get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and stood in line for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
The agenda included all the issues that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans are equally likely to stay in Mexico today rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to join forces with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, even though he did not give any details about it.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought on the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country's leadership under restrained rifles to leave more than half of its territory to them.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event cannot be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official makes even the mildest criticism of Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - complaints about how the Americans oppress the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma go on the war path.
And yet Mexico’s greatest challenge lies in its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about resentment?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or grandparents - was not offered a chance in Mexico and emigrated north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness is to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now have lived the American dream, attended good schools and received good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of humiliating defeat and look down upon us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our gang to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, born in Guadalajara and legally immigrating to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans resent them.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel that they belong neither to the one country nor to the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and sections of the educational bourgeoisie want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
Let us tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leaders to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through this alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico centuries and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans harbor a grudge over how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such a hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual accusations, countless buildings were laid in ruins, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza were struck near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems far from appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, the week-long struggles have strengthened the hard-boiled on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed the Israelis back, even though his group itself suffered great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are imprisoned in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet succeeded in destroying Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken hold of the Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubilant Hamas adherents believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist character might stand before Bashar Assad's downfall, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And especially the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt - by far the most populous and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region sustainably.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is in marriage to Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot even be pushed out by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, have an opposite conclusion.
Militaryly, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has proved its worth and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep calmly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States holds firmly to its position. Many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has been doing well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the blocking facilities that have flowed into the West Bank and thus into the main part of a possible Palestinian state, which, however, continue to protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared contrary to international law.
Netanyahu is doing well. His Likud party joined forces with an even more militant group in the run-up to the January 22 elections under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why spoil these deceitful Palestinians and leave them with their own state?
If they were actually in control of the West Bank, would they not fire rockets just like their fellow Gazans?
No, it's better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to prevail, but the Arab Spring could put them in the balance.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will first concentrate on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economies.
The fact that pragmatic President Morsi joined forces with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolise the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still being deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Suppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only worsen.
Bloody Hamas repression missions in Gaza will increasingly take their diplomatic toll over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The correct answer is that represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states where Israel leaves for security purposes.
The hope - little for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give more influence to outsiders to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop the arms deliveries to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchanges and a common Jerusalem.
External Arab nations should also encourage Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also play his part in encouraging Israel to negotiate.
During his first term in office, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house it seems as if he is also averse to participation.
But that is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a major interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for uniform cigarette packaging come into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and infants and children suffering from cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, there is the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small font.
Thus Australia introduces the world's strictest regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian government wants to discourage young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government assumes studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking at the age of 26 will no longer start smoking with 99% probability after that.
"You can already see in children of young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws favored the black market trade, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much larger quantities of these products on the roads of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone covers to cover the unbearable packaging has increased enormously since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies failed two months ago at the Australian Supreme Court with their legal challenge.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesalers and is waiting for new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
According to experts, the catch in the popularity of social media is precisely the population to which the plan is aimed.
A number of Australian laws have banished tobacco companies from TV advertising, banned them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most traders to stop putting cigarettes into shops. Now tobacco advertising has switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Anyone who markets tobacco and has only one small area left to advertise their products can't get around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noted an increase in experience reports on brands written by "normal people."
You have to ask yourself the question: is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that they even record a video for it - or does a marketing agency have something to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of focusing on marketing, industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organisation about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries are trading more heavily with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has had talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to issue photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show defiance.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm just ignoring her.
"You just take a smoke and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box with a photo printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to refill its shelves.
"It used to take me an hour to sort a shipment, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should have banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're shutting down," he adds visibly angry.
In a constantly electrified world, it's nice to be bored
This Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane failed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to think about getting bored.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting for half a day at the airport for a flight is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it's okay for us - and our children - to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to get lost in interesting ways of thinking, which may encourage creativity.
And because most of us today are almost constantly staring at one screen or the other, we no longer benefit from the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), does not see it that way.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
The house walls of Pompeii adorn a Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there's the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom can be defined as the experience of "desiring to do a satisfying job but not being able to do it".
Boredom therefore differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists in "disturbing the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is passing slowly".
Boredom can almost sound like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, bored persons see the problem in their environment or in the world, while depressed persons see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, even if we're just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", for example: "The Inactive Mind: The Definition of Boredom from the Aspects of Attention", published in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a band on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
Those who heard the hard - to - hear television said that they were bored more than the other two groups - they had problems concentrating, could not find a reason for them, and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
When trying to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you do a monotonous job - "like the search for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help not to feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that zapping and scribble, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people more physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to walk around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske said.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a booming speaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale of boredom susceptibility".
On the scale there are statements like "Many things I have to do, repeat themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys get bored more often than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially in terms of the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty tense bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored in school and doing homework, while 23% said they were bored when they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson says that he does not know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he was sure that "youth was felt to be particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers did not have a great influence on their daily routine.
Back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall into gambling or drugs to alleviate them - studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades, is of this opinion.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," says Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do right now.
If you're bored and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you'll be happy.
But while television can provide happiness in the short term, it disappears in the long run.
So if you pass an iPad to your bored child, you can get it away from boredom. However, it has not learned how to entertain or control yourself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control transfers from one situation to the other."
The child not only learns to talk, but also receives more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we view them too critically.
Instead, our goal should be to feel at home even outside of the constant activity and technology sprinkle.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we often have to be bored, but boredom is the agonizing, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth people are only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly being overstimulated, it is difficult to deal with the noise once the noise has stopped."
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and soccer player Anthony Orozco stands for an offense in the southeast of Colorado, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few marijuana chunks and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving a car in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was subpoenaed for possession of drugs and drug supplies - cavalier offences, each with a penalty of 100 US dollars - and received a court date.
"We're treated like criminals," Orozco says.
But is he one of them?
In the uncertain weeks after the state's decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for its own use, the response to hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of irregularities involving marijuana have already been dropped here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer prosecute adults over 21 years of age for small-scale possessions. This is permitted by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative counties of Colorado have announced that they will continue to pursue existing marijuana offences and are still quoting people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
"This situation is developing so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well-suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Spirits Authority.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent to follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on December 6, and thus also forms the end point of a grey area in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but possession is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time - for example, how the government's requirement of "adequate access" to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the ban on cannabis shops within 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21st, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his Aurora staff saying that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offences on persons over 21 years of age, and that the police would "as of now" not seek criminal charges for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce urban regulations to regulate growers of medical marijuana and that drug traffickers would continue to be persecuted.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his agency would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 persons have to account for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been charged for other crimes.
"Our agency has a duty to prosecute violations that were criminal offences at the time of the crime," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are ambivalent even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer show adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding property proceedings.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile personal marijuana consumption with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state brought a profound discord among local officials with regard to the great green experiment to light.
District prosecutors are a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents defendants for marijuana offences in court and acts as a spokesperson for the national organization for reforming marijuana laws on the ground.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives trying to prosecute people for still not being able to accept legalisation," he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national models for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an era of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government to continue treating the sale and cultivation of marijuana at federal level as a criminal offence.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite several sensational arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has largely permitted the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Obama administration drug policy advisor, believes that while criminal officials are unlikely to enter doors to confiscate smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to resist the legal, state-regulated marijuana businesses under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local community administrations approved moratoria for new marijuana stores, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, adopted a six-month ban, which is expected to be passed next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at federal level," said Bob Nicholson, member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are guided by what the community has chosen and not by what the state has chosen.
There are still many questions to be answered.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It had always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once considered to be the world’s greatest science stamp, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization — free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my arrival at Worscester College at the end of the eighties - where I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcases again and thus brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I left because I had a problem with fellow students having sex in the adjacent room.
The author A N Wilson said that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I did, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason - a reason that seemed so narrow-minded and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: My late father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, according to recent reports, a new generation of moderate right-wing students suffer similar persecution.
The organized and increasing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that one group of them last week demanded the same equality protection that benefits gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable" because of their political views.
They demand a place in their college's equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was aggravated by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", depicting Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It showed, among other things, graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and boasted with silver-coloured suit and silver-occupied walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are regarded as "sins for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative student association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing leftist tendency at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know each other."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes such a climate is "unpleasant." 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-designate of the conservative student association of Oxford, says she has witnessed a growing rejection of JCR members against students of moderate rights.
"This is a danger to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old I had arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university voted not to give Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would even have made Stalinists startle.
In the first days of the first semester week, during which new students meet each other and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I had the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but also participated with pleasure.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, privatization and the rejection of the government of sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime found their way into the wooden paneled rooms of the tutorial.
At the first of these events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been aware of what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (deathed in the meantime), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and pretty ugly.
"Do Thatcher followers grow up learning French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students giggled.
My eyes were filled with tears.
"I suggest that you take a few French lessons in your spare time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt growled to me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That night, I was sitting alone at dinner in college when someone lightly tapped me on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James who introduced himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it's what it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory is being bullied.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory freshmen pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to disguise myself.
I insisted that I didn't agree with Mrs. Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics, who ironically attended Eton College, considered conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" someone asked me.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever succeed in living a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I not be able to meet like-minded people until after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that lay ahead of me stretched before my spiritual eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor who openly identified himself as Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for his Marxist-Determinist historical perspective.
In 1997 he took up a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents’ home and found refuge with more open - minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed unbelieving.
During his time in the Forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreamy towertops.
Even my Communist friends have always displayed impeccable manners.
His wet eyes clouded.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure you're just being teased.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory followers, had given in to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another historian had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Even though I went secret with shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to "brainwash," calling them "old fools."
The relief lasted only a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my bunnies gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You're welcome to call me a whiny limp.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This was acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grand retrospective for which more than 130 haute couture dresses were created by his "Maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the stifling and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be on display until 3 March, there are a large number of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the modest fashion designer in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility doesn't have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't kick their cigarettes out on your beautiful carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s they lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion designer.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music one recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," recalls the "top model" that began her career at the haute couture week in Paris in 1995.
"He never gets out of fashion because his designs are artworks," she concludes.
Fashion Show of Origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious 60-metre-long catwalk that proposes a role swap: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the catwalk to admire a dreamlike "audiance" that wears Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls, names such as those of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the fashion designer, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable."
I remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty," adds Feria's ex-duchess.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and opinion leader in the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally happened.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a feast in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped bodice with a cleavage that honors his name.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, its obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion designer "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the associated memories".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion designer called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half meter long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the chief authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the clients of the highest society".
For years, Valentino has been clouded by the elite's "savoir-être" and is now her best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honour, cumulated Garavani as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his calmness, his well-kept and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg admits.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was immaculate; time leaves no trace on him."
And this says a princess...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health if they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by taking sulfur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulphurous gas flowing out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After he has broken out large sulfur stones that can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the sloping paths made of stone.
Although it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb at turtle pace, keeping the balance and carefully setting their steps so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell on the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 Eurocents for every kilo of sulphur they mine.
Arriving at the top, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk with the tiresome heavy baskets three kilometers to the Libra, which a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who since 1960 has used the deposits in the volcano and (never better said) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for each kilo of sulphur.
She then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) each to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for producing matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even bleaching sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each way," explains Anto, who normally does three routes a day.
For each route he needs three hours, after which he is completely finished, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
But what looks like a miserable wage for such a sheer inhuman effort is three times what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid a day at the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, for a reason that is as important as sulphur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hinduists, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
27-year-old Anto has been risking his life at the Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left his first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent but life-punished young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a stretcher.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other wearers and gets up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets with sulfur on their shoulders at the crater floor.
Despite its huge profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur mining to save costs and does not supply any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid for by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, which the guardians of this nature park together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) require of the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrier.
"This work is for the animals and not for the human being," protests Madrusin, a stocky 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues "as long as he can" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even when the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners clamp into the thick columns that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course except the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik, with his 53 years of age, is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks over a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari at a distance of 18 kilometers.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, with some teeth missing.
Of his five children, the elder also works as a sulfur carrier at the age of 30.
Time passes, but poverty keeps generation to generation in one of the toughest occupations in the world: that of those who work as human donkeys at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame the fact that they don't have children on their careers, the stress and the costs of real estate and raising children.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife: let's do our civic duty and make life!
It seems implausible that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint candy, but nevertheless - or precisely because of this - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local sayings such as "sliding will be a "bao" (laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, keeps the hope that the commercial will reach in a fun way to raise awareness of the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their "national duty."
This is only for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world when we plant, so we realized that this is an issue that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don't we do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 children
Those who do not take this issue lightly are the government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Board, says this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have much more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities than to marry and make a family," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the increase in the number of single persons and to the delaying of marriage and births, the result of which is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counteract the reduction of the population has led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore achieved its worst result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs, and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small apartments are built.
It has already had an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Agency has begun to monitor the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the single person’s lifestyle, and that they discourage construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
This makes them much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new standards will give developers clearer orientations, which have previously been hampered if they want to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with the Singaporeans working in the financial district show that they will not have a major impact.
"People are very stressed, the homes and education are expensive, which is why many put it off," says a young manager.
The children can have others.
"It's important for me to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women cite their careers, stress and the cost of ownership and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
That is why the Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children - there is so much the government can do.
The offline private offline is private online
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "that area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to his everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he makes known on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the Internet.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very personal" at the personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"I wouldn't disclose my deepest secrets in a post," says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother is allowed to know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't mine, or someone who makes the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to post obscene photos, naked photos, crimes, or offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if someone answers me, I'm just uploading it," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
When asked, he answers that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone approached him with a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits not to know 20 of the people he has added to his friends list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to the boy, no one has made any suggestions or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone pushes me or demands them from me, I simply remove them from my user account," he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unknown to experiences known today as cyberbullying.
A friend's friend was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never found out who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim didn't close the account.
"He only did it privately."
He then explains a number of steps to configure a user account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, that's what I'd do if he was unsympathetic or if I wanted to get rid of him.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, English teacher with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orientate children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a medium for searching for information, but with the publication of these pages the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants", formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
They are the digital natives, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We're the digital immigrants they're supposed to teach when we're still learning," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we require them to have a defined criterion on what can be disseminated, published or said, at an age where maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be selective if they want to be popular, have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is to ask them questions that make them think.
"Telling you not to do it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then calls some possibilities: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to have a photo of you published, like the one you published from a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Do everyone need to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they need to act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educator, comments that it is essential that parents carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
When they understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "Don't talk to strangers."
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and was supposed to be signed theoretically by the seven governments present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Chancellery initially announced that they would hand it over after the retreat, but then explained that it would be published on the Peruvian government's website at some time.
When asked about the text, they stated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information on the summit was limited at all times.
During the day only the image of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulating among journalists was received by the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, causing discomfort among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
Afterwards, the President of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the Humala Declaration and not the official document at the end of the summit.
Last October Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was not published, despite a strong press call.
On the official ASPA website, you can see that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were in place for journalists, but to a large extent they restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a ruling by the Court of Justice of The Hague, which resolves a border conflict between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which begins on Monday in The Hague, in the trial Lima initiated against Santiago to listen to the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the verdict on the differences we are currently bringing before this international court," said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to the international courts," Piñera adds and greeted Humala with a handshake against the flags of both countries.
Both Presidents confirmed that they would submit to the ICJ after Colombia had brought an action against the Bogotá Agreement following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious mistake, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
The summit was attended by the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of its President Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and concluded the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The head of state read the final document, in which it announced that 16 decisions were taken and that the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set for a total investment of 17 billion dollars.
Regarding the decisions taken, he said that the countries of Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He announced that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on triumphant features, but rather serve to expand our production output and to show our peoples a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial connections in South America, especially in rural and border areas... thus uniting our countries and opening up new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read-out statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvians, who would be on the transversal axes of his territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which would provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations" from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before beginning his participation in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico, in order to treat the maritime conflict respectfully according to a verdict of the ICC questioned by Bogotá.
"Maybe tomorrow (Saturday) I will meet President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also requires talks with Nicaragua," he underlined.
"I hope to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc also met in advance to adopt the 2013 Plan of Action to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru presides over the regional bloc.
"South America must learn to integrate its citizens," says Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, whereby "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Lima, declared to state television in Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II and other conflicts" and "are now practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that would advance the member states of Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that want to return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OEA) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return we sign the South Americans always everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and is financed by the United States," he said as an allusion to the political asylum that Ecuador has granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured him that he did not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles, but followed his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that there were "reasoned assumptions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his procedure would not be complied with."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which had asked him to interrogate him on his territory for alleged sexual offences, while "Swedish jurisprudence allowed this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out via Ecuador's embassy in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange's health and mental condition would be affected.
"Since he was in our embassy, I haven't spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," said Ecuador's head of state.
There is, however, a danger that he would suffer physical and psychological damage because he was trapped in a confined space and could not perform physical exercises outdoors.
"This would affect everyone's health," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Embassy of Ecuador in London was the granting of a licence to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He underlined that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European legal authorities, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, conducts a series of proceedings on various European bodies," he said.
And "when Britain grants this charter tomorrow, I think it's done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as Swedish jurisprudence allows and in other cases was done, the problem would be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate were "the mediocrity, the evil intention and the lie that invalidated freedom of expression."
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek and blackmail profit," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated Ecuador for not being dominated by such journalists "and not by bankers or hegemonic and petty-bourgeois countries," and anticipated that, in a re-election, he "will deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and not allow any opportunism and no coup d'état disguised as legal" because it "destructed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to be "absolutely justified" now and after the ruling of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favoured the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua to negotiate the maritime borders between the two countries with Nicaragua.
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be treated comprehensively so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international authorities if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, even if it is very harsh."
With regard to the possibility of being a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he stated that he saw this opportunity "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 elections, he would retire from political life.
I have never personally been interested in power, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to shoulder this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, after which I withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to Vice-President of Venezuela Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had travelled there for a planned, routine treatment and that he would be expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"In no case does it mean a relapse in the health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State attended today in Lima the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of dying because of AIDS today is too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed with the results of the investigation: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried "to weaken" without any apparent success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to learn about it; and this with such dedication that he was celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because it led to a dead end."
At that time AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and where the virus has already done harm and exhausted their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the occurrence of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who receives treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of HCG's HIV unit, saying that this information was supported by a prestigious scientific publication in April this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists concluded since 2008 that AIDS was not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of impairment of the immune system of individuals at the start of treatment, and that those who are not addicted to drugs had greater chances: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above remarks mean that those who receive the diagnosis HIV-positive at the age of 25 can, in this sense, "become 75 years old without problems as long as they are under control," said this expert.
In order to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA Annual Report), it is still true that 60 percent of the patients registered in the national database have died since the advent of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May of this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that universal access to antiretroviral medicines has been available since 2005.
- So why do people still die from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any drug supply problems. The problem is that people come in a far advanced state because they do not know their infection condition, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence global mortality, more early diagnoses are required, which is why all persons requiring this need massive detection tests."
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients such as Fabrizio, who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, for the sole reason that he had made a friend of his who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi sarcoma (a cancer-like tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I prefer to burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, exercise and take the medication.
Today, all his parents know is that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot of work, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to encourage with his testimony those who are afraid today in the context of the worldwide AIDS day.
They should take the test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big holes between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken care of the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the designated places, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; previously they were delivered individually, now they give us packets with a hundred pieces, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"What do you need them for?" is a widespread mockery question of social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health care system, which young people do not want to expose themselves to, the correspondent assured.
He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the counter, but in public toilets in public toilets of facilities frequented by young people.
Promiscuity should not be promoted.
They are not to be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether there would be a distribution of reserves under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he put it to the point.
Key Jalisco figures
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is in fourth place nationally, new and cumulated AIDS cases, and 13th place in terms of HIV.
92% of the infections occur via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for each registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
After the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a ruling that does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group reached through a trade dispute in Mexico, a disastrous precedent will be created for any national company with subsidiaries in the neighbouring country that has payment problems.
One could say, then, that the procedures for the survival of companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the land of the stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the verdict given on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas Court for the northern district of Texas leads Mexican companies to be helplessly seized of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies.
While the judge points out that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the court of appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first of all says that the main proceedings are the trade dispute dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings for companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
Indeed, to this end, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created, using the American Law Institute as a mediator.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the votes of the companies, the majority required for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy assets held by the branches of Vitro with its parent company.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundesinstitut für Handelskonkurs) among companies in the group.
It is also true that after the withdrawal of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who sued Vitro in the United States courts, i.e. the vultures funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for his difficult situation from 2008 onwards in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States that struck the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family objected to the same court of appeal so that the vote would be taken in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not accepted, the Cerciorare appeal is filed, which calls for the review of the proceedings by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing about this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the Mexican government under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), describing the proceedings conducted by Vitro under the Law on Commercial Prices, and pointing out that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules on cases of cross-border insolvency that guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambola: a blow for vitro and for the country.
General balance
After several months of complaints by the Mexican air transport unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of a fraudulent administration, the Asociación Sindicical de Pilotos Aviadores (Union of Pilots) has finally made progress.
The application, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has now filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
Subsequently, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the main administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw from Bank IXE’s F/589 Trustee Account under the name of Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares in Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a Forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the Wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
Prior to that, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry) has managed to unite the governors in the southeast to oppose the monumental institution that partially destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all industrial threats.
ACTA is dead
Because the government has issued a request from the Senate to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place despite the fact that the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it considered them to be a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex long term
In the pursuit of paying long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex is launching stock exchange certificates of over 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four equal issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
Formed from the companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading companies in information technology, a group of companies was founded under the name Competival, whose objective is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to over 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The basketball globetrotter, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been associated with basket sport for more than 60 years and has travelled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large intellectual collection of the history of basketball in the country as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, be it as a lower-ranking player, first national league player, agent and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Association.
"All my life, I have put on many hats in basketball, even several at the same time when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-fifties as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-executor or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I was allowed to be part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as managing director, co-manager or coach.
It was many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked as a coach here and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a very strong and 2 m tall player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who became a citizen and was one of our best throwers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would provide another.
The Vaqueros championship with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and that of Mincy in the national team.
I remember the first time we won against the USA at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
After that came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, which should have been bronze if not this Canadian referee had let us repeat the last turn for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as those who won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is the team of the Pan-American Games 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the team of the USA a fight, as they did when they won bronze against us at the World Championship.
The team included not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great joy, was that of the 1995 pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the locked players because of the events at the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as much as Piculín.
And this without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he has played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
That's a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill from the boys.
What do you think is the best you've done in the bandage?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s to 17 teams in one season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today the children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed trainings and courses for coaches, table officers and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I enjoy listening to music, watching videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and occasionally going to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always at my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he played the iconic role he liked the most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebration of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, journalist Jeffrey Lane told her.
He gave joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray explained in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Beschanzende Jeannie" of the television station NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "Dshinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He was also the actor of two comedies that were only broadcast for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His films included well-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the charmingly abhorrent J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic television series CBS about the Ewing clan and other characters in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who shot J.R.?", which was supposed to create expectation for an episode full of emotions where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were bet in bet houses.

When the answer in a chapter became known in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned "Dallas" into the second most seen entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had got her pregnant and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but others also had reasons to want him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a sneaky businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) committed.
"I know what to say on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should read "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-actor of the original series, remembered Hagman as an "enormous personality on and outside the screen" on Friday.
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of worshipers in the world, and it remains in our hearts for those who have been fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT television channel.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just filmed, informed the station.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT as to how the loss of Hagmann would be dealt with in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theater stages in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything that I believed could harm or affect someone in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he volunteered for liver donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are imminent and afterwards," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "don't worry, it's a bit uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine".
He also opposed smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Start of the course, which studies the "end of the world"
Every week, the students investigate apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the Mayan calendar's "long reverse count" on 21 December, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some called "Deudarmaggedon", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place from which Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé said this week to the students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey.
If someone analyses what has happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who is offering courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, the associate professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, the students investigate apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
"I tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course called "The End of the World".
"We're not recording 2012 so that we can always retain the option of holding the course anew, in case the world doesn't go down," said Restall.
Despite the "preliminary demise", students must study, create projects and take part in final examinations.
In Penn State, the final exam is held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other chance than "to continue working until the night when the world is supposedly coming to an end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"There were no more seats in two hours," said Restall about his high-average course for students who filled up with 35 students.
Weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received emails from students who asked if there were still places available.
The students, for their part, assure us that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually only a question of consolation or its lack.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for Psychology and Nursing explains that he has seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard of a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students questioned - and not so much a professor - stated that they believed in the last date of December 21st.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and in a certain way we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, a student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that dates back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"Other places people don't think like that," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course there about the "end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an allusion to an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken of by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21st, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophize that December 21st was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said that they wanted to go to celebrations about "the end of the world".
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communication student.
