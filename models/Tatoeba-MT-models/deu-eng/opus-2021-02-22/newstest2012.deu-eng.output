No liberating amendment for Tymozhenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today refused to propose to abolish, as part of an amendment to the Criminal Code, the clause on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been sentenced.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the liberation of the imprisoned ex-premier minister, was rejected by the MEPs at the second reading of the request to alleviate the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding a supposedly negative contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, and the appeal of the convicted is to be brought before the court in December.
Timoshenko himself describes the verdict as political revenge of the regime and also in the West the trial led to suspicion of the bias of the court.
The request to remove Section 365, on the basis of which the ex-premier minister was sentenced, from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 deputies.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As usual in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council professed the customary right of Shar'a, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft you chop off your hand.
Women, too, should quickly forget thoughts of emancipation, any apostates of faith will be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will in future be united by the Koran from opposing tribes.
In short, Libya will have an order that is hard to imagine and, above all, hardly desirable in this country.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively seen probably not the best and would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans.
Seen in this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters even let themselves be helped by the unbelieving dogs.
To their excuse, it may be only the fact that NATO's airstrikes were not directed by any General from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in a firefight, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any advantage whatsoever.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
Thus the locals are rid of a worry - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
But do the oil companies get the black gold at a mocking price even without occupation?
Hardly, and so the West can at long last boast of its selflessness in the protection of human rights.
If this does not spoil the Shar'a representatives for them.
Start of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm hit Europe.
The individual countries published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, with Germany and France increasing.
The bond market is breaking all records today.
Investors are keeping an eye not only on Greece, but also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
As expected, Germany's GDP grew by 0.5% and France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of forecast 0.1%), while France admitted a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data only referred to stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Statistical Office, the trend towards a slowdown in economic performance was confirmed.
The results are therefore worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to provisional and seasonally overestimated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the eurozone as a whole and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield on their 10-year government bonds climbed to 28.45%.
The return on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The yield on Czech government bonds remains below 4%, even if the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, voices are voiced that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well played goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent goal of Petr Jiráček, she won 1-0 in Montenegro.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from the home game and will once again not be missing at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the promotion game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won 1-0 thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and has thus redeemed their ticket for the European Football Championship.
Also because of the precise defense game of the Czech team, they could put more pressure on the Montenegrins only in the second half.
The bad luck birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who missed two huge chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be participating in the European Championships next year, and it is also gratifying that local football will receive a premium of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes on, quite militant football was played.
Both teams combined tediously and so was played mainly around the middle line.
Even in the second half the pressure of the home team was not there and the large tees before the penalty area were successfully repelled by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object Tuesday noon and then announced the death of the United States and Israel.
On Tuesday, a few hundred students from the University of Isfahan, Iran, formed a living shield around the core technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
In doing so, they wanted to make it clear that they are willing to protect their country's core programme, even with their own lives, if necessary.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran seems to have long since abandoned its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon before the entrance to the complex and then announced death to the US and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, in the event of an attack intended to paralyze Iran's nuclear program, the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan's target would also be out of the center in Isfahan.
The menu of a fat addicted child: It does not eat breakfast and sausage for dinner
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important the environment is for a person's healthy development, in which he grows up and are the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more common on the table than in families where normal - weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had fries for dinner the day before the educational campaign under the motto "Adiposity is no coincidence".
In families with fat children, sport is also not one of the favourite activities, which also affects the majority of today's students - only 15 percent replied that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 Children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, and nearly 900 children from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic were surveyed.
This was already the second year of the "Adipositas is not a coincidence" campaign, which is supported by the general health insurance fund and the Unilever company.
To date, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th grades have participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are decisive factors that are responsible for the alarming increase in the number of overweight or even obesity children.
"Only half of the children surveyed, for example, said eating breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-vesper dinner five times a day - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that also relative small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the pupils' families have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone has breakfast for themselves.
Worst of all was the statement that one in ten families does not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered to be the cornerstone of healthy daily nutrition.
Among other things, the survey test revealed that in the families of overweight children, unhealthy fries are often consumed.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed do sports, only less than half of their parents do so - only 15 percent.
Set up your own menu
Another part of the survey made it possible for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to come up with their own menu from the possibilities offered by appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of diet is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite dishes were many pastries, meat dishes and, of course, desserts.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonades", is emphasized in the final report to this survey.
At lunch, the main dish, pasta won just before poultry.
The children almost didn't like pulses and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Returning to Health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In the control group of the survey participants who completed the questionnaire after completing the enlightening lecture "Adiposity is not a coincidence" there was in many cases a marked shift in preferences towards principles of healthy nutrition", is stated in the results of the project.
This was eye-catching, for example, with the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed poultry or fish much more frequently as the main dish of the day and were ready to eat less dumplings or sweet food.
Pros claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I had a bit moaned that this was a bit too much stuff to start with.
I didn't know in the least what was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the square" is going.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer we get to the test, the more information and practical tasks ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with director Alena (not a single man participates in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideal proportioned figure.
And that's what most of us are.
Some have too short a neck, others have too young a figure without proper curves and others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to conceal wide shoulders visually, extend the neck or conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to attract a female type like Jennifer Lopez - i.e. with a big bosom, wide hip and narrow waist - pretty and figure-hugging, without her being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so big that the skirt or pants really don't fit, you should at least have a piece tailored to your needs.
You won't regret that, because well-fitting clothing is simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt, you feel much better than in one of the poles, which is getting too high and slippery, standing at the waist, etc.
Young figures can in turn allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, pads, applications, embroidery or ruffle.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week to let everything go through my mind thoroughly.
And yet I'm afraid that it's almost impossible to do it in the face of the assigned homework.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity for whom she was supposed to create suitable outfits - daywear and evening robe.
We should take into account the current look, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, whom you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
On the inside I cheer, because this is much better for me personally than, for example, putting on Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to a hundred kilos in recent times (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the clothes from magazines or search the internet, print them out and then edit them graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design are to be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models physically, but also shapes the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But it's not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall view.
The Saturday lecture filled with information about figure types was seasoned by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And sent in stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in quite different ways.
The magic word is called variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as usual over the jeans, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heel shoes and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or the collar and immediately the whole look looks completely different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of all, the following advice came to mind: "First, you must know the rules perfectly."
"Only then will you be allowed to hurt her," Jakub said.
At last I realize why we have to timpani all these teachings, what you can combine with what and why, even if you often get to see quite different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more types of clothing than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to reckon with all this in the design of the outfit.
Jan Pokorný confirmed that image and styl sometimes make up half of the success.
You just have to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also well-known personalities often consider this to be thrown out money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look at it is secondary).
And if one of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely impose a completely different (smaller) size on us than he or she really needs.
Then all you have to do is google to find out for sure that the tabloid press writes that the appropriate celebrity has returned to or lost, etc.
Jan and Mario urged us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "build" the outfit.
In his work, he has to communicate with the people he styles and he has to be a clever psychologist.
To judge people without bending and standing up to his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to sift through her wardrobe and add some pretty pieces, then we can't clean out the whole closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to which you recommend what you can contribute," says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what such a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So this is a bag that you button at the waist and carry with you all the necessary proprieties.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, hair-removing wrappers or safety pins, it also contains utensils such as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips that are used to pick up clothes in the back if it is too large (pins or other clamps are prohibited so that the fabric does not break) and, of course, sewing tools.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something out in practice, we learned how to properly glue shoes.
Also while photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, one can damage the sole of the shoe, let alone the outside.
We were stuck and glued...
With scissors you must not even touch the shoes, so that you do not damage them.
So you really have to be clever.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was only a fraction of what we heard at the second weekend-continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me now - to devote yourself to styling on a professional level is no child's play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree journey becomes a routine journey to the early shift due to a series of completely avoidable, dilettant errors.
Although it succeeded in fulfilling the ambitions to a large extent, what good is that, if obviously no one wanted to do a bit more?
Even before he came to the counters, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" raised high expectations.
After all, he promised to move the already year-old game series "Need for Speed" into a new dimension again and in the playable demonstration examples he did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about the fitting passages in which the main protagonist climbs out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you're used to with NFS, in the end, much is different than you expected.
Sure - potentially there are quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is diminished by some superfluous mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So there are actually no more mistakes, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
First of all, one is introduced to history, whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to take part in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, that is, on the west coast, you sit on the wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race takes place on a different track and that the individual stages take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
One has no moment the impression that game would offer the same over and over again.
Some environments are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the drive through the desert, through autumnal landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape looks visually very pleasant.
Every now and then atypical elements bring a little variety into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts sight.
In the mountains, on the other hand, one has to watch out in hell that one is not buried by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well in succession.
Only a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you still expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And the police get involved, too, trying to screw up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages where Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less passages in the game than one would expect (actually only three).
In the end, this is more of a benefit to the matter, because this element at least has no chance of getting bored - it belongs to the elements that make the game more varied in the context of the above.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today's point of view, it does not rip out trees, but on the other hand it cannot be said to be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But the local driving model continues to do quite well for action-packed racing, although one could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything's in perfect order.
Real problems only appear after a certain period of time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not entirely OK.
A game of this kind is hardly to be expected that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no idea before impact on any object how the car behaves, then obviously everything is not okay.
Typical example: In the narrow overtaking or passing by oncoming cars one "strips" at some places the other car only lightly, in other, almost identical situation one comes into the slingshot and turns wild pirouettes.
Or the car's about to crash.
Thanks to the Restart system, it doesn't matter, it's always annoying.
The restarts are solved like this: if you have total damage or land far off the track, then the game throws you back to the last clue of the track.
Only - in each race you only have five Restarts.
Once you've exhausted it, everything starts from the beginning.
So the Restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't succeed, but you shouldn't rely on it.
Sometimes, however, even the rest kind does not help, there nothing but to learn the critical section from the head.
Very unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to be driven through in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit through.
Elsewhere, at the appropriate point, you always encounter "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you are the first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the opponent is passing by two oncoming cars in front of one, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around them or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed in such a way that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where one is always overtaken at the same place by the same opponent and here again without regard to the time.
This is the craziest way to complete the game on the long bridge that you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent obviously has to get you out of here on the devil.
And if he's in front of you, then of course he takes the view, so that you drive your own car a few times in Klump.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly spoils the joy of the game.
And that's a pity, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is generally quite entertaining and sometimes so action-packed that you almost don't know where your head is.
And basically it doesn't matter what is "guilty" about it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in such a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the car change in the course of the races.
One must not overlook the petrol stations on the route, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car is sufficient, which you just have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
The task mode (challenges) also goes hand in hand with the mode of game history - i.e. the races in the individual locations you know from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also points of experience to gain for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and the history.
To get to the higher driver level, various items must be unlocked: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time connected with the online function Autolog, which compares among other things its own achieved results with those of other players and also provides for further collective functions.
Another unintelligible carver is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you get by car into a subway tunnel (because of me), where you race in the dark on the rails long (because of me).
On the speedometer, numbers look between 150 a 200 km/h (because of me), but suddenly a subway comes from behind and drives one uncompromisingly to scrap.
In our editorial office we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and here and there even brilliant.
All the more annoying is that at some exciting moments the refresh rate slows down and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this applies in particular to accidents involving a greater number of people, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound reproduction is OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to address as broad a scale as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack was created a lá "of everyone something" - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game was not diminished by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned above, we could have claimed with the boob tone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems kind of unfinished.
An in itself a great pleasure, but one should be prepared that these mistakes stick in your eyes with the power of airport headlights.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has put the balance between the various institutions at risk."
I would not have expected such a hard war to burn."
"It will take five or six years for the waves to smooth out and everyone to get used to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law quite sharply.
In the first part of her lecture, in which she was able to describe the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have envied many of the lecturers of the Faculty of Law at Karlsuniversität.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At the beginning there was criticism that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who couldn't cope with such a role, but I must say that it has taken everyone's breath away as well as he has taken care of it.
"He is a person who can patiently listen to and communicate with twenty-seven member states and, above all, has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number should I call?", that is, as an important step towards the agreement and better readability of EU policies towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to forbid us our oil-caps Quargel
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived, lives and intends to live in the near future.
Two years ago, she described the Czech Presidency as a success.
The Czechs had managed the financial crisis and the gas crisis and had also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the government's case during the Presidency as a major negative that had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the Ambassador, not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, has been quite hectic.
And the EU's seven-year budget still needs to be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a lean and economical budget, which sectors of the economy will receive priority, which countries will receive more and which less support - all this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Understanding Europe".
"If I don't like something, then it's greyish abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
As a citizen, how can I really know whether people in Brussels are really crumbling or thinking out round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes or whether someone is actually trying to ban us from the quarges?
It would also have liked to have used the EU's soil to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in prospect
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics, who perceive the negative side of the matter more than the positive side.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and is a Slovak nearby, then the Frenchman next to me says: "Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is that your V4 again?" and doing so makes a pretty sour face.
According to Mrs Vicenové, the EU will in future expect, above all, tough rules for the budget policies of the Member States.
As much more real, as a "European federation", it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"Here we have the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want it should work together and those who do not want it should stand quietly apart."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately amounts to a strong "Europe of different speeds", Ms Vicenová expects.
In this regard, she also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues with an impact on the EU as a whole must be discussed by all Member States and not just by the eurozone countries.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to search for a suitable word that characterizes IBM's strategy most accurately, then this would probably be the word "longevity".
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, known as a modern company, although a century has passed since it was founded.
The basis for this longevity was already laid by their first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
He was already saying that countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" thus became a trademark for the future giant's life (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which was already published by IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen's thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous move towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for a whole century because it remained true to its principles and did not hesitate to change everything else around.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, the business and also the society in the course of our first century.
We hope to do even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
Thoughtful system
In the 1930s, Watson had been taking care of his employees in a similar way to the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had paid leave as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a well-thought-out pay system for the best newer and merchant.
IBM's long-term relationships with its customers are just as sophisticated.
The company was brilliant in talent promotion right from the start - as one of the first companies in the world IBM abolished all discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan will replace at the head of IBM next year by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she has taken on the position of Sales, Marketing and Strategy Manager.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations emerge.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, the company employs almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unwavering position in business guarantees the company a strong image, both internally and externally.
"From the very beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist, the professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with the help of technologies," added George Colony of the consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself points out, it is a difference to be present in the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo called because of family "Big Blue" has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product width - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM owns the most patents and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most well-known inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes or diskettes.
With approximately 220 billion dollars of market value (market capitalization), IBM was the second largest technology company this year (right after Apple), with Microsoft being overtaken for the first time since 1996.
Ahead of the Look
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of today's customers - unfortunate for example were the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so one must not bind emotionally to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they don't work, leaving them again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
IBM's profits are largely shared by services, software and hardware, each accounting for one fifth.
In 1990 hardware was still the most represented with more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little $15 billion worth of profitable assets, but at the same time invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
In these investments IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world like a storm for the first time.
Here, too, IBM remained true to the legacy of its first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the midst of the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM survives today's crisis without prejudice.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent in rocket form since 2008 and the company's net profit continues to grow.
IBM's corporate slogan is: everything can be changed - only the values can't be changed.
This is also why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also cope with the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutters to space flights
Founded a hundred years ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for the later IBM company was the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technologies such as the famous clocks for the registration of the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also chairman of the board of directors until 1930, became the architect of this new company.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competition firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
This leader even overshadowed IBM's founders - Watson's ideas are still based on the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson managed the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began producing and selling all kinds of machinery for the trade - from sausage and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four decades of Watson's management of the company, he doubled its turnover to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the executive chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM helped NASA conduct flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture in 1964 - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which determined the computer standard of that time, came into the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus entered fully into the business with consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the last three years is the "Smarter Planet" concept.
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned so far, for example to improve the situation in transport and in city management.
In the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smart Commerce" platform to help traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932 IBM founded a branch in the then Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe at all.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe headquarters is located in Prague and here is also a top research team of world level that deals with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová on her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become their lover by the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of her life she has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová had given the singer I. Bartošová refuge in her own house, she wouldn't even have imagined how this would end with her husband.
When Iveta moved back and forth after 30 days on her request, Joseph went with him.
Yes, he even publicly confessed that he loved her.
In time Darina resigned, even it seemed as if she wanted to reconcile herself with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with
If Rychtář Iveta should leave Bartošová in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to end his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have certain ties," revealed Mrs Rychtářová; but she also said that she had already separated emotionally from him and insisted on mutual decency alone.
Joseph wears the fact that Darina has locked the back door for him with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues to run, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"I talk to Darina quite normally, we just don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he does not want to stop her.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I realize this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take over all responsibility.
The worst female abusers: what about you?
If you ask the men to name some typical female abusers, they shake some promptly out of the sleeve without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we let pass a few immoral revues again, which let the men flow the blood in the veins?
Shopping
Does their husband accuse them of being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one hader a week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a little bit more for promotions?
Then I guess your case is really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping appetite under control.
But hand on heart, which woman can do it already, in the search for a well-fitting outerwear only so to stroll through a clothing store and not immediately try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even if shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about how many times they've told her husband - you better stay outside...
Constant discontent
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do you even like me?"
Does that look familiar to you?
Yeah?
Then I guess you're one of the women who's really obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn't mean you're supposed to let go, but many men are allergic to it when your wife is constantly complaining about her appearance.
The stronger gender is agreed - with the increasing frequency of complaints, women are becoming more and more incompatible.
Order and cleanliness in first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Are you insulting your partner because he tramples on the clean tiles with dirty shoes again, you scolded the children, because the just scrubbed sink is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet has fingerprints again, where polishing makes so much effort?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you must not exaggerate anything and that order and cleanliness in family life are not in the first place.
In the end, this excessive sense of purity can also harm mutual relationships and, above all, family peace.
Chicks
"Dirty gym pants come in the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put on the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that this will put him on the palm tree.
Of course that's not a bad idea, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not have had to complain so much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to clap and gossip, there is whispering or even slandering behind their backs or making alliances.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to haggle through such topics as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably every one of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and gossip in store.
Hand on heart - this is probably all women's.
However, this is not to be confused with gossipants of the grossest caliber, to whom nothing and nobody is sacred, who despise everyone in their environment and who pose a considerable danger, especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
Jaromír Jágr, who played in the NHL's Monday match, played a major role in the Philadelphia 5–3 victory in the Carolina Ice Hockey League, becoming the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star's overview benefited from Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was declared the best player in the match.
Jágr's fellow player Jakub Voráček also recorded two assists in the same game.
After the game, Jágr claimed to have predicted Giroux a big evening to journalists.
"Even before the game, I'll tell him he's doing a hat trick today."
I kind of felt that."
"A feeling like this happens again and again," Jágr explained, after whose action Giroux scored a goal at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráček fought the puck behind the Hurricanes' goal and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the whistle of the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short hand, but the second third was again the Flyers.
Specifically, Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr he scored his third goal, then Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but I'm sure he's one of the best three," Jágr praised his center.
"I wouldn't have thought of playing with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"I'm so happy."
"I'm cutting my game towards me."
"All these years in the NHL, my fellow players set their game on me and now the pike turns around," Jágr smiled.
Carolina turned the game into a drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who prevailed from a penalty shot, it came up to a goal.
However, Matt Read prevented any further complication in which he was in excess of two against one successful.
"Excellently, Pronger was still operating in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (Read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked," Voráček described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
This victory brought Philadelphia to the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defenceman of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured Buffalo in the game and retired in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
The Candiens lost their lead in Penalty-shooting 2:3 in addition to their Beck experience.
Tomáš Plekanec could not turn one of the penalty shots.
More than the lost points hurt the coach of the home team probably the high illness-related failure in the defensive - they played the game only with five defense players to the end.
"That's bad."
"We only finished the encounter with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"With each change, one wave of attacks after another and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."
There were reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defense players.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec fought thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5-2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters were involved.
Travel price trends since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five state travel agencies approved in the then Czech Republic: Čedok, sporturist, CKM, recrea and autoturist.
At that time the travel agencies sold mainly only trips to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, to the West at that time only selected ones were allowed.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore the trips to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (i.e. the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual trips were not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies offered trips to the West, but then one had to accept huge snakes or even stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or have at least "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even that was not the way things were going.
The so-called foreign exchange pledge - the condition for a departure to the West - was given only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to obtain the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West without a foreign exchange commitment.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and daches - a habit that continues to this day.
A travel revolution of the Czechs followed the 1989 revolution.
While a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad last year in countries around the world.
A huge paradox that one is no longer aware of today is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular holiday country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 at all, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, the foreign exchange obligation was abolished in the neighbouring Western European countries, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
The Czech vacationers slept in the tent in the park while travelling to Paris, because who would have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension at that time.
A typical feature of trips abroad from Czechs was a trunk packed with canned food, beer and sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and thus the average salaries increased, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies began to prepare regularly for travel by charter flights after 1997, making air travel unbelievably cheaper than in the past thanks to the possibility to negotiate volume discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the US, had already had moneyless payments with all the world's advanced countries, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-office" travel came in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was handled - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying every year to distant sunny countries; this year, twelve exotic destinations will be flying directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 thousand Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another important moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the world's advanced countries.
For the first time in 2008, Czechs spent more than half their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than CZK 15 thousand per person for a single holiday stay, including the costs at the resort.
The Annual General Meeting is to find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has no chairman, and the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) is not even known after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there has been no agreement on which electoral order should be elected.
And without this, no vote is possible at all on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his role, calling on his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old quarrels broke out again between the two federation chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear and clear on 16 September, when the new chairman was to be chosen.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting had come to the People's House in the Smíchov district of Prague for nothing, because the negotiations did not result and it was not just about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full assembly - only the statutory representatives or also the functionaries equipped with a power of attorney.
On this single point, agreement was reached at least in part, to which the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law contributed, which, in its opinion, did not allow representation on a proxy basis.
However, the dispute over the electoral order continues.
Nor did the Executive Committee bring any more clarity into the matter, at whose meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, nothing else is on the agenda at all in principle.
Even if the views on the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how should one proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a stalemate situation?
"The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or whether a completely different model needs to be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of FAČR, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the Chamber for which he is running wins.
Moravia is supposedly prepared to respond to the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds no longer have any sense at all, this mode would question the entire bicameral concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would be best not to bend the electoral order, but to choose according to valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, even if it appears that the statutory electoral order is most likely to meet Pelta from all candidates.
"My wish is that, as far as possible, they will be elected according to the statutes."
"So that no absurd substitutes are devised, as at the last general meeting," declared the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who ran for the first time and distinguished himself from Pelta in his statements.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively together in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European Football Championship today would certainly contribute to calming the spirits."
"If football first rides on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater", says the official from Jablonec, who has the greatest experience of all three adepts, both at a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambivalent."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "justify" the regulations for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a further blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that common sense will ultimately win," said Rajchl.
Only - there is not much time left for all sides to agree.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generality will be complete by the qualifying match.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, among others, were to fly to Podgorice, could not take off in the morning in Prague due to a technical malfunction and so one looked feverishly for a replacement variant, as one can still bring a part of the executive committee to the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiel.
Finally, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday, is crucial.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to have moved the divided parties within the largest sports association in the country to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the trustworthiness of Czech football and the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will point the Czech sport in a new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into the fight for the position of chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers, could have made up a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the football association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have entered the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favourite of the election, Pelta, from getting to the head of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that, in the event of his victory, he intends to serve as chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to have seen an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
"I spoke to a few people in question in person."
"It's hard to believe that some told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly interferes with Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is regarded as a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Paclík that Pelta should hold the chairman's position.
"Today's state of affairs would be conserved during his victory and Czech football would not go forward at all."
"The support from Berbr, a clever business man, would be twice as bad for football," said Paclík.
He also refers to the fact that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone interceptions for the investigation in a corruption affair, from which Pelta emerged without penalty.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to (ch.) football."
"And how would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA", said řekl Paclík, who saw his earlier saying that "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes president", but already a little more relaxed.
If Paclík wins in the Thursday election, however, he could well imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
The same is true of another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the October general meeting, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could well imagine him as head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he's capable of running the association as a manager."
"I'm not stuck in matters I don't understand," said Paclík, who had caused a stir in September, replacing Dagmar Damková, who was behind the dismissal of the referee commission with Luák Macela.
Paclík himself claims that he has grown up to be the president of the association.
And he relies on his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer he is also head of Pilsen, who celebrated the first triumph in the league with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups who tend to influence disciplinary and appointment commissions, which degenerates into disgusting situations," said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy, for example, to the Spartan leader Daniel Křetínský.
One of his priorities would be to strengthen relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders for more money from the lottery tax to sport.
"This is one of the crucial things the new chairman should devote himself to."
"When it comes to taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but they also have to say clearly where the money goes," he said.
Paclík does not regard his connection to the Pilsner club as a handicap either, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FAČR must be "non-partisan".
Pelta on the other hand is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"It doesn't make much sense for me to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third party in order to return after a year and a half," Paclík made clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which in future triggered a stalemate.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the chair, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for new statutes for the FAČR, which in future would rule out disputes about the electoral rules from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly defuse if the Czech selection succeeds.
Pelta had already promised, before the unrealized election in September, that if he was elected, he would concentrate on the national team and the acquisition of funding.
He only decided at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting, so the two-month break might help him to defend his ideas about the management of football and to present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels devote themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association was run by someone, says the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonecer Club, but who also acted for many years at Sparta and on the Executive Committee.
This is also why he thinks that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed in Ivan Hašek's time is responsible for today's problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, at the June Annual General Meeting, articles of association were approved that were not as perfect as all had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September," said Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the citizens' association that he used as a means of attracting the delegates.
"If I should become chairman, I will accept this personally and am willing to bear personal responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a matter of principle that he cannot be without," says Pelta.
Furthermore, he does not try to distinguish himself from his opponents.
He had already announced before that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, which he acknowledges because of his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, which in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football, it has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"However, his attacks were deplorable and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That's why many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remains true to his proclamations that he had already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is knowledge of football from the lowest leagues to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians to the aftermath of the corruption scandal of last year."
"Right after that, I would rush to negotiate with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football," said the forty-six-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean staff cleaning.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, there is understandable nervousness.
Despite the catastrophic scenarios accompanying the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If the only controversial point really should be how to vote in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"Soccer needs credibility and it will only win it back if he finally has a new leader", Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his function career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will begin to work hard under him
If the former vice-chairman Jindřich Rajchl was elected as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would supposedly spoil the mood of many people in the Association.
Rajchl promises that if he chooses, he will start working hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and otherwise continue the work begun by previous chairman Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
From international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, professional football, to performance football for the youth."
"I don't mean to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in a conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and I would therefore like to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member devotes himself to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that football progresses with miles in every segment."
Many would not be delighted about this, because instead of criticizing others, they would have to start working really hard themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it had been considered not to run at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that there are people behind me who don't constantly throw clubs between my legs and question every step I make," he said as an explanation of why he hesitated.
"But many people told me that I should not give up because otherwise others would."
"That's trust you can't lose," he said.
He is also said to be motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we've done a lot of work and I don't want to throw that away."
"Processes have been launched that will probably only take place in a few years and I would hate to see them stopped by someone," he said, expressing his concerns that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and this is something Mirek Pelta doesn't do."
"Behind him are above all people who would make football so that it would only be there for the chosen."
I may be blamed for a few things, but not for being partial."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone is fine and not just the chosen one," Rajchl noted.
He also disagrees with the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which then each went up to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a particular problem for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Because the head of the Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík has joined the struggle for the function of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances that he will be elected.
"I have strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-chairman and now realizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the saving of tens of millions of kroner for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he blames himself in part for the fact that the bandage does not pull a single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the start to give Czech football new confidence", he considers the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question the fact that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
"Should he be elected, he would probably continue to do the things Ivan Hašek has initiated and would obviously not fundamentally change the staffing of the commissions."
He wouldn't want to bend things in his favor," Rajchl says about his rival.
Europe’s most beautiful pools
Jump in the Blue
By Julia Stanek
Paddling pool in Ufo-Optik, pompous pools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue miracle - and after a city tour or a hike the tired legs rest in whirlpool baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip over the past one and a half years, one thing was not to be missed in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Rugging on the water, she looked up into artistically designed domes, she swam towards marble doves waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at meticulously restored art nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a bath, she took it up in her notebook - with interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architecture historian Meder in this way - and now presents them in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "journey to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
She doesn't have much to do with sports, says Meder - only in the water it is different.
Annoyingly only that swimming fans have to settle for themselves with blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can inhale the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful bird chirping in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Vienna-based Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Splaetzer in the diving pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so big because all the senses are served, said Meder.
And if the builders have tried hard, swimming halls can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in baths."
"On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format illustrated book "Badefreuden" conveys interesting information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases on 190 pages - but above all makes you want to jump into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found a nitrate-containing water in a rustic karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose pools are filled with alkali-containing water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: while the Züricher Dachbad has the whole city in mind, one can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which one can observe the hustle and bustle on the ski slope.
The perhaps most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
From three bowls open upwards it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector Meder rose the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulphur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so much like heating oil that one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing medicinal water, which is almost black and whose silt sticks to the skin as soon as you slip into the pelvis - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: When she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a closed terrain.
The bathroom, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
When Meder took a look through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds grow between the tiles.
On the other hand, one has counteracted the decay in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction have already passed through this bath; one can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements dating from the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because it was originally from the Black Forest.
"It is already an achievement to merge such different architectural styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only minor.
Agricultural Speculation
Deutsche Bank Investigates Raw Materials Business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank abandon its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the Group CEO then wants to draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
The matter is clear for the German citizens: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions step out of this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges drive up prices - and the banks therefore bear a complicity in the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protection is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank boss Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to hedge traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled themselves from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to examine the allegations and said that no business was "worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit is to be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Management Board of Deutsche Bank - including a recommendation on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the head of the bank then wants to tell us what consequences it will have.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even the complete reversal.
Ackermann tinkers with his image
Foodwatch CEO Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "Betting on rising food prices shows particularly dramatically how ruthlessly banks today are damaging the general good."
Ackermann, as the top bank lobbyist, is now particularly obliging.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio that use money for betting on food prices," Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is about people suffering from hunger or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann comes at first glance as a surprise, but it is clear that the Group CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before leaving office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not change to the Supervisory Board unlike planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible losses, he hardly needs to care - that would eventually have to do with his successor.
One in two would announce raw material plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Institute Forsa surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Just eleven percent therefore consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences when they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: According to the survey, one in two would terminate all investments in which money flows into the commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances against such a bank, 49 percent said to think about quitting their account and moving to another institution.
21er Haus in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with ups, downs and happy endings: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and disappeared.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
If modern post-war architecture is enthralled by clear forms, glass halls, bold turns and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is an apt and famous example of the Brüssler World Exhibition 1958.
At the time, Dicker's pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built Austria's pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like extension in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, was erected in the Swiss Garden near the Vienna South Railway Station after the world exhibition, rebuilt and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century - the "20er Haus" was called it.
However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art got a new house in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere in 2007, has completed the new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, an art historian with a remarkable career, among other things, in his youth as an ice figure skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, implemented the conversion strongly among politicians and monument conservationists, raised public funds and private sponsorship funds and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there should be a café and a bookshop, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the execution then Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna with Schwanzer and the pavilion was for him a "unfortunately important place" where he had watched the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost its generosity and ease when it was moved to Vienna and its conversion.
There were far greater problems with the current conversion: the building was "an energy throw", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, glass fibre-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel beams have been reinforced or replaced and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two basements provided space for the new use, a lowered light ditch between the house and the street provides for the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red-brown rust protection color.
And the cinema room is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all under strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that was good and cheap and also liked the monument protection office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and modifications, the building has remained flexible and light.
It had been difficult with the pavilion "which came from Brussels", Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21er Haus is not in the wrong place, because an urban development lucky case has occurred: Around the Swiss garden, the completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential buildings, is being created.
And another case of luck may still occur: The 21er Haus could be strengthened by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and as you can hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighbourly location in the Swiss Garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package in millions
The railway has worked out a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
According to a newspaper report, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year in the fight against winter-related train failures and delays.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance on the basis of an intra-group crisis plan that investments of a total of around 300 million euros are planned by 2015.
The aim was to improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks, even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, a doubling of internal and external employees for the removal of snow on railway systems and platforms to 16,000 people is planned.
The aim is to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary turnouts.
Two months ago, railway manager Rüdiger Grube had warned about train failures and delays after a top meeting with government and industry this winter.
Last winter, the railways had considerable problems in passenger transport, as they lacked reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
Numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been struggling for years that it has to have axles of ICE trains tested much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE in Cologne's main station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank Pays Millions in the USA
After the tumult around chief Josef Ackermann, new trouble comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million bucks there.
As if the problems at home for Deutsche Bank were not enough, the industry giant is now also catching up with its past in the USA: The Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to settle disputes about the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a whole series of large banks of leading cooperative banks to buy the financial products with false promises; they have played down the risks.
Such papers lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks into the depths.
"We are satisfied that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank admitted no guilt with the settlement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which committed itself to the payment of 20.5 million dollars.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions made by the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US cooperative banks and intervenes in bankruptcies to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get compensation for the billion-dollar damage it caused.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also taken other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the US real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became the fate of a large number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers overturned.
Even though events have been going on for a few years, there is a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and supervisory authorities have tried countless lawsuits to obtain redress or to punish misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks of overprivileging two US state-owned real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in mortgage deals worth around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a lawsuit from FHFA, which deals with several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurters stand for "substantial losses", without, however, mentioning an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion at IBM
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased more than $10 billion worth of shares.
So far, the major American investor Warren Buffett had always declared that he would not invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies could not be predicted.
However, he had now read IBM's annual reports and changed his opinion about investments in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offered services and provided computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is regarded as a knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, IBM is now allowed to call itself "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now revealed in the US business channel CNBC that he has been buying IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known anything about the engagement so far.
He praised the management, which had made good profits even in the economic crisis.
"You did a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
IBM has been relying for some time on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies until now.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett accessed a freight railway, a lubricant manufacturer or mechanical engineer, for example.
Its Berkshire Hathaway holding has around 80 own subsidiaries and shares in a number of major corporations such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and developed it with wise investments into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet his life - style is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors all over the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha".
After becoming aware of the Buffett investment, the IBM share rose by one percent on a pre-exchange basis.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also known, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock market, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he didn't want to join.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media doubt the German constitutional state.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now reviving.
The murders of eight Turkish-born and one Greek small business owner between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is being addressed with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, a ghost long believed to be dead returns: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks.
Nevertheless, the fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the exposed right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology reviving?" headlined the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators is said to have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities may also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted calmly: it reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate on the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors the togetherness had been staged - as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media seems like a slap in the face: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the title of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which talks about the background of the murder series.
Nor can the German edition of the "Hürriyet" be taken away from drawing this mental connection.
"It starts to stink," is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that people had been murdered who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, the police's actions and their subsequent search success are extremely critically discussed.
The authors are surprised at why the German authorities had not come up with a much earlier idea of searching for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some people are at least rhetorically prepared for drastic means: "If we continue to shame here, the migrants have no choice but self-defense and arming."
"It'll probably be the best self-protection."
"The inner peace in Germany depends very much on the goodness of the Enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network," writes Selen.
The attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s highlighted what it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance can result in right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the sense of self on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was particularly criticised: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the attack by Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President, but was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.In his speech, Kinkel listed how many taxes the local Turks paid.
Quite as if the value of a person is calculated by the amount of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been since then.
In addition to the efforts of an extensive investigation and re-evaluation of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The scandal bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now let a German judge do it.
Axel Weber certainly didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would start an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was pleased publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its new solidity and dropped friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
"The UBS did the turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But already in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A UBS dealer in London had bypassed all the bank's security systems and gambled around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, UBS' Chairman of the Board of Directors has also been regarded as a victim - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally arrive?
It has already become known that Weber will be able to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the Chairmanship of the Board of Directors already in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
It's gonna be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, he is a professor of economics and a central banker, and certainly would have needed a training period.
With one blow, he then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proven once again that it has long since earned the title of "Europe's largest scandal bank".
For UBS is on the one hand huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand it has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
It began in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She combined the image of the secretive and solid, but also lavished Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very big number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money-rich clients than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, as an investment bank, it had advanced into the league of the world’s largest banks.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, former banker and later long-time bank professor in Zurich, explains: "At that time, I always presented UBS as a model of a good bank for my students."
"From today's point of view, how could I be so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something went wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who until then had been regarded as a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, they knew why he had left.
The bank's investment division had gambled with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
In order to bear this in mind, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs.
For this she actually found investors, however, which some until recently would have squeezed their noses about: an intransparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund that was so secret that one did not even know its name.
But that was just the first blow.
It got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, Switzerland's second-best-paid Board of Directors in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was facing collapse in view of its misinvestment in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, while the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a compulsory convertible bond, which enabled it to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it hosts such large banks.
Finally, UBS’s balance sheet total in 2007 was more than five times the size of Switzerland’s economic performance (see chart).
"Once again, we couldn't save UBS," says bank researcher Geiger.
The first catastrophe was followed by the second.
Just a few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who might have been behind taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it agreed to a payment of $780 million - to repay unjustified profits from these transactions, including a fine.
Thus, UBS more or less openly confessed to having helped in tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both core business areas: in investment banking through misspeculation and in asset management through help to evade tax.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just as you thought, now the UBS will be able to do it again, this unfortunate dealer story follows: A single dealer gambles 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it turns out that risk management in investment banking is obviously still not working.
"With the Adoboli case, it has been noted that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The CFO of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with UBS is that it does not control risk control."
But it had been precisely the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago begun to become guardians of the great wealth of the world: no too great risks, but security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic the world might break down.
The vaults of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank - it's just a bit bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The bank is headquartered on Züricher Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main station to Lake Zurich, which is surrounded by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception room of UBS is accessed by a heavy rotating door.
Inside the walls are marble-clad, in front are thick leather armchairs, next to the bench logo a large sign to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
Both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, however, eventually supplanted this idea of the Swiss bank - or reveal how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds it.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two major banks.
The UBS had become far too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say there.
"And if they do, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it high profits, and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss major bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"That Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided on the biggest rescue action in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
The politicians granted up to 68 billion Swiss francs or around 45 billion euros to save the large bank that was facing bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
Speaking to Swiss bankers, they see the problem above all in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss major banks joined forces to form a huge group.
A bank was created that was already too big for little Switzerland during the merger - and grew ever further.
It helped the two different predecessor banks of UBS to complement each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalized bank.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers got a lot of money to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest, who understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the bellyman, who has worked up from the bank theory to the very top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear, gloom came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the management meetings, on which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: Goldman Sachs push off the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go, to the top.
A few steps had already been taken.
In the foreign exchange business and in the stock trade she played at the top.
However, management consultants who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there was a huge gap with the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in US subprime investments.
It developed into a huge machine that packaged and passed on securities to American mortgage loans - but also retained risks.
Also, when other banks were long looking for the exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to go when the attempts to clean up failed more difficult than expected.
Positions at UBS became a spin seat and are shaky to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has lost all obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: stop investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is expected to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has prevailed: he is supposed to run UBS's business permanently, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to go back to the mid-1990s.
He's pulling 3500 spots.
That won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is probably already asking himself.
So far, he has only publicly said that he and his wife will first look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock exchanges
The impending recession in Europe has taken the courage of US investors to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without force.
The throttled industrial production on the continent suffocated hopes for a stabilisation of the debt crisis in the bud.
The general relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass last week was still considered half full, not half empty - but now the problems came to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all financial values were on the sales notes.
The Dow Jones index of the default values recorded a 0.6 percent drop at 12,078 points at the close of trading.
In the course of trade, the market barometer fluctuated between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The broader S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a decline of one percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange index lost 0.8 percent and went out of trading with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax bid farewell with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5985 counters.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced production and is preparing for the end of the upswing.
Businesses produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, as reported by Eurostat.
That made the US investors skeptical: "We are not an island, we are dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe would not be able to free itself from a recession so quickly, and there would also be further signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do anything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
He therefore felt that it was too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett overthrew a decade-old principle and entered the US technology industry.
His investment in IBM of more than ten billion dollars supported the share price of the traditional company and had it listed at first just under one percent higher against the trend in the course of trading.
The paper closed almost unchanged at 187.35 dollars.
Buffett has paid an average of 170 dollars per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of its investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
At 2.6 percent, shares of the Bank of America declined significantly more than the market.
The house silver-plated almost all the rest of its shares in China Construction Bank and pocketed 6.6 billion dollars for it.
With the net profit from the business, the institution primarily wants to cushion its capital ratio and thus meet tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The share won 1.5 percent after the Group had collected the largest order in its history.
On Sunday, Airline Emirates ordered 50 777 long-haul aircraft and estimated the value of the order at $18 billion.
Including options on 20 other machines, the volume amounts to even 26 billion dollars.
On the New York Stock Exchange, approximately 710 million shares were transferred to owners.
719 values increased, 2281 fell and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares increased by 630, in 1913 by minus and 82.
Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places seed crows are regarded as "problem birds": However, experts claim that the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities.
Some like it, others want to get rid of it very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities, local residents suffer from dirt and noise from animals.
A remedy against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
The first crow symposium in the East Frisian void, experts said, could no longer get seed crows out of the cities.
There, experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Nature conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the rural exodus of the particularly protected seed crows: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys the traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing cultivation and falling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs exist in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the district caused negative headlines.
Critics had described the capture of the animals in bird traps and the killing with clubs as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the excavation, does nothing," noted the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer.
Spraying away nests with water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals escape, large colonies split up and spread elsewhere."
Burial is only conceivable as an exception to hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
A combination of animals from sensitive living areas and lure offers is conceivable in order to resettle them elsewhere.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens promoted "information boards instead of chainsaws" for a completely different way of dealing with the animals: "After all, we can best bear a pimple in our face with confidence."
Jürgens had co-founded the Aschenberger Krähen educational trail in Schleswig-Holstein, where signs inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed crows not only use tools to get a treat, but even produce their own tools as aids.
Behavioural researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested on four seed crows how far the intelligence of the birds reaches.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to use stones to bring a scaffold to collapse in order to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determined what size and shape a stone must have in order to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the clever crows had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid them pieces of wire.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket on the handle out of the tube.
Three of the four seed crows managed to do so at once.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to the European Championship 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup failed.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland are present at the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.
Led by double-succeeding superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd) Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect the fifth consecutive European Championship participation after the 0:0.
The Czechs had a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off game against outsiders Montenegro, after the in-game (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
Croatia did not burn any more in the 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland won a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other matches for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trade meter (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa against Portugal.
Portugal took a custom start in the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo chased a free kick out of about 30 meters to the early lead into the stitches.
A good quarter of an hour later Nani showed his long shot qualities and hit the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance through goal hunter Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English league leader Manchester City put a headball on the lower edge of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Afterwards, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was the focus.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty room, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic certainly transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-European Champion made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time in a row that the European Champion of 1976 will be competing in the European Championship.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to survive a shock second already in the initial phase.
Finalist Petr Cech prevented a possible goal by Tomas Sivok (9.) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the rotation of the penalty room limit only barely past the goal of Cech.
After the break the cross bar had to save for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of the FC Seoul had taken off (50.).
The gate just before the end finally made everything clear.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to clear his place on the bench of the World Cup third of 2002, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in a final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan only hit the pole in the seventh minute with a distance shot, assailant Kazim Kazim could not sink the bouncer in the goal.
After the moment of shock, however, Croatia took control more and more.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who took the place from the 62nd minute for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic, the Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bavaria Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in action.
Trapattoni goes to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first EM participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision in the 32nd minute with the 4-0 victory in the first round.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) made the appearance for the guests.
Ireland has been pushing the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment the Estonian back team prevented the possible lead hit.
But in the 32nd minute it was time.
After an accident of defense of finisher Pavel Londak Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball to the 1-0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer, SAP, is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around two billion dollars (around 1.5 billion euros) will flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and recruit employees accordingly," announced co-chief Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the global leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
SAP is currently present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the world's more than 176 000 SAP customers are based in Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP plans to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers had redeemed around 12.5 billion euros.
At present, the business of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is almost never done before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott explained.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Terror. A Story of the First World War, told in nineteen destinies" begins with a long list of main characters that goes to your heart.
Here is a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You'll get to know these people very well in Englund's romantic narrative, and these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when, like Englund's men and women, you're lost in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book which he does not misdescribe as "a work of anti-history".
It contains few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's not a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It's about "feeling, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and Terror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, from school girls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, become mad or die.
Each of these lives flickers up like the votive candles in a church, some are added while others are extinguished.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war of position on the Western front.
"Beauty and Terror" wanders with expert view over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall bee baskets, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that smells like Kordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's at home with her children and hears gunfire in the distance.
Who's coming, anyway?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Missing facts," says Englund, "have been smeared with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Terror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be frightening or touching, but they are extremely alive in Englunds of the collection of small moments lost in details.
Many of them are talking about lack and helping themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he says: "Replacement, replacement everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the replacement meal in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and last served with a fake bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes lined with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes that were allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to savagery and says about the war: "One feels that despite everything that was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in his hand, and pretending to mean such a facade civilization and as if there was no barbarity behind his own strengthened and foggy shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die and that no one will take notice of it or take care of it.
"If you refrain from the idea of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who has been hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that falls apart, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word skillful and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a tailor-made suit that kills while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseen way and there are as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect a prostitute with a venereal disease in order to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonococcal pus, because soldiers bought and greased themselves on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital like this," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, causing them to be blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from Peter Graves' Swedish, Englund's poetry becomes smooth and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "uncontrollable forces unleashed in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly falsified like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West nothing new" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I have ever read about in a non-fiction book.
I'm not giving it back.
But it's like with his book, he grabbed this side of the main characters in front of us and lit them with a match.
After an early misstep, a minute planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
They had chosen the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there were hardly any people in the Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. Everyone else initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was in the midst of them and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and gave the squatters an enormous increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by observing how occupations in other cities were handled.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials stepped up the so-called chaos training - counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid transfer of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," said someone familiar with the commands, which spoke of a declaration as "exercise."
"The few police officers involved, to my knowledge, did not know that it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14th, officials wanted to vacate the park, but then retreated when hundreds of protesters came together after they learned about these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in Tuesday's operation, including operational commandos from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials normally deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people in and out of the park, almost like commuters, so that 1:00 a.m. at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do so when the smallest number of people are in the park," he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before the departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and the pre-recorded messages roaring from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left the place.
The police said that by 1:45 a.m. no tents would be touched to give the protesters time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police president, said that this had happened for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they were trying to stop them from watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the officials were very rough.
Mr. Browne said that television cars on Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken photos.
When the police moved west through the big mess of personal belongings of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial grass and bags with clothes, their employees followed the city cleaning that picked up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main centre of protesters moved near the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp tied up to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them loose.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 p.m.
According to police, the eviction was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests, as he said, were due to "indecent conduct and resistance to arrest."
The most prominent local official was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department, the highest uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the police department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not lead the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were built on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, one block further south.
It could be observed how from these locations the police extended the perimeter further and further around Zuccotti Park.
In one place it was observed that several officials, many of them with protective signs, drove people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Trade union of supervisors will file lawsuits against the city for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of school supervisors who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday because the dismissals are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last opportunity open to the union, District Council 37, in their efforts to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were among the city's worst paid employees and who lost their jobs in a move on 7 October described the union leaders as political revenge for refusing access to a health fund maintained by the working groups last year to close the household gap.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the city council Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the layoffs were part of the budget, that they had passed in June.
A member of the city council fired back and told him that there was nothing specific in the budget that employees of the school help would be dismissed.
City Council 37 officials said they had and warned the Department of Education about a lawsuit. On Wednesday there will be a press conference at which the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the City Department of Education as defendants and eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson for the city's Ministry of Justice, said that the lawsuit was not before the city and that their individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a bill of complaint submitted by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the poor neighborhoods of the city to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment. It claims that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfunded.
It states that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school workers in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn have lost and 46 helpers in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx have been dismissed.
By noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: "This is not a neighbourhood of bewitched parents who can organize donations to absorb budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was cut by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its method of calculating the extra funding for each poor school enrolment.
The union also complains that the heads of high schools were misled by the language in a memo authorising the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the plot, even if "excess" (translate in German) in the USA usually describes the change of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
" Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred," the draft complaint states.
Mission completed, Congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, it looks like Republicans and Democrats are already in Washington to agree on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the cessation of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate Committee on International Relations will adopt a resolution under the leadership of Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "mut".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of two parties' support for their democratic efforts."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, legislators from both parties and the White House argued about the choice of words in a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the role of the US military in NATO's Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising the restricted use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this law passed in the Senate. Moreover, the Chamber overruled a resolution to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the US mission became a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress that was upset enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not angry enough to pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their enormous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Committee or will they divide the legislators, as the June law did?
The last version encounters the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee's top republican.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is up to the Senate this week to vote on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every Republican and some Democrats Congressional legislature.
The measures led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or any other area that is currently being voted on in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have tried so far unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have tried often enough.
Goodlatte's amendment is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been submitted to this Congress and cover a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law has been submitted to both Congress and Senate - others differ only slightly.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners among Republicans who want to polish up their CV - the opportunity to brag that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, which was passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit to two terms of office of the president.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage among same - sex women is a recurring template, as is a change that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two thirds of the states reject them.
As eager as the members propose changes, they move as unevenly faster than in recent years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators submitted 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades in comparison to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today’s ones.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Bound, but not defeated," said Giffords in the first TV interview following the assassination attempt
Ten months after an armed man shot at her from a distance during an election event in Tucson, the Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night. She alone sang the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to Congress.
When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she struggled for words and needed help walking.
The show showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet that split its skull, pierced the left side of its brain and crossed its head from front to rear.
Three months ago, she unexpectedly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt brake.
In her first TV interview after the January attack, in which six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) answered, "Very good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special that was recorded shortly before the couple's new book was published: "Gabby: A Story about Courage and Hope."
The Special has been tracking Gifford's recovery since the January 8 assassination.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, she is seen in the hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with the head.
A twitch with the lips.
And then, her first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast." She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: You can see the congressman singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours with therapy every day, said that she could not remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said that he had read Gifford's article on March 12 to a newspaper about the assassination when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is forcibly treated medically while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Tough, hard, hard."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated?"," Kelly said.
You just got hit.
And you're gonna get through this and you're gonna recover and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel pity rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him on one cue.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraiser in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, who was observed, among other things, by the Chief of Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really it wasn't.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are heaped with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, say servants.
The public is increasingly acting as if people were suffering in uniform.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way of support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in conflict with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that was inflicting on returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations take place about compassion in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a sense of awe because they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there was a "happy, violent veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over a high-ranking state post in Washington upon his return.
During his search for work, he said, he felt that some of the questioners subtly asked whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian explained to his sons.
The military's lack of lightness is partly due to the Americans' lack of interest in the war.
Performances on the battlefield are rarely taken out as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it was absolutely normal during World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a staff member.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in a rape case before the military court.
If that does not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Senior Private Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier colleague at night.
It was October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texan wiped away her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously awaiting trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a lawsuit they have brought against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admitted to court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not take action against widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially comprised 17 plaintiffs, but rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all claiming that they were raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, condemn or provide appropriate jurisdiction according to the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, as the problem starts there.
"The military is hierarchically structured," she says.
"Who are the individual persons who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February, she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, so to speak, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by state attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to dismiss the lawsuit.
The files of the court, which are available to Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries that have occurred in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court law, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiffs' military service," the document states.
The Department of Defense refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the only difference lies in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In Iraq as well as in Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars 150 female soldiers died, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to be modernized, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three other lawsuits are pending except her.
At Yale Law School, Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for alleged promotion of a woman-hostile atmosphere.
Independently, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America are collecting a lawsuit against the military focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that rape victims received in order to dismiss them from service - a common practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration (the War Veterans Administration) in which she accused her discriminatory practices in dealing with benefit claims for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in service.
Nine laws were independently presented to Congress by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, which provide a number of clues.
According to the Ministry of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported in 2010.
However, most abuses are not reported at all and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases per year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines the law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases recorded in the military were brought to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole series of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had before the attack with her boyfriend.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember well the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the labors would start. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric ward and I remember that when I came out, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his trial. That was my trial."
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her unfit for duty.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably released, so she won't receive any support.
Whether the lawsuit that Lyman and the other plaintiffs filed is progressing is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I'm a critic of the Feres doctrine all my life.
The military lags behind for a decade because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence as liability.
He adds, "The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the plaintiff's attorney, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms come about," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed a killing in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is by far not alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time on his attack in front of his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on the side of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you only have to log in to Facebook.
"We found that it wasn't difficult to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding of personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply need to use the page's advertising tool to precisely determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of extreme right-wing groups across Europe and then targeted them with add-ons, but instead of linking to a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking for their level of education, their attitude towards violence and their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 supporters of 14 very right-wing parties in 11 European countries – without even having to leave their office once.
"It's a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online supporters of right-wing extreme groups are mostly young, male and annoyed about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, Facebook's "Data Supernova" is generating a research boom that has increased the number of scientific papers with the name of this page in the title by nearly 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that through this page you can study people you don't normally reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They first had to inform the party and it would never have allowed them access," Bartlett says.
"On Facebook, it all falls away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues has found that students who discussed their drunkenness on Facebook are significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who remained silent on this issue.
Moreno suggests that equivalent students, for example residential consultants, monitor the site and help a student if they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children that would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook is also constantly tapping into the data of its own population.
The page's data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and a National Lucky Index (primarily using data that only Facebook has access to - masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make their large data pit accessible to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they want it or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to use its own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey that they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, on a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information is true in a user profile and in posts.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of the social - and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
"Cold and inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who has confessed to two killings, in which 77 people were killed this summer in Norway, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance in a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knight Templar of Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the laws, but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue as he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted confirmation that he was behind lock and key.
Everyone took part with the aim that everything would go towards closing the way.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian radio station NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a little further after I have seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and blue tie and looked calm and professional throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre hint that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not insane and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may please some that the July 22 attacks were apparently the work of a single extremist, not a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said a victim's relative.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the genius of technology as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans find perhaps the most revealing in the recently rediscovered job interview, which was dedusted this week before special film screenings on the important markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and self-appointed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who was diligent in making diagrams - a man who believed that many executives were suffering from "a disease of thinking," "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995 Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph der Fach Idioten" about the departure of the personal computer. And he sat with Jobs for more than an hour in which they had one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, 10 years had passed since jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company, NeXT, and was looking forward to the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in specialist idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing during the delivery.
It was only after Jobs' death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which is coming to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known for abhorring extensive interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly eager here in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to light when he seemingly impatiently responds to Cringely's questions and prompts him to respond more quickly to topics or side actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the Lost Interview somehow appears uncannyly farsighted when Jobs evaluates what other companies make his opinion right or wrong and represents his own vision of the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read posthumous appreciations of career jobs', but seeing jobs here as the eager dreamer on the move to grandeur is something very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"Over the years in business, I always ask, "Why do you do things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in the business really thinks deeply about things.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues its efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Astonished, how costs were recorded - usually started with "standard costs", which were calculated on mere assumption and which were then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest.
How the Pope was fooled:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could sneak into the telephone company and lead long-distance calls for free.
Much has already been written about the device, but job enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another as they loop through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent stuff around the globe half a dozen times, and when you got into the phone, it came out a minute later in the phone next door," says Jobs giggled.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious prank that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called the Vatican in the middle of the night via Blue Box and wanted to talk to the Pope while they could imitate Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, they had to laugh before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a part-time job for the summer at Hewlett-Packard.
"That had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever manufactured."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for them.
How to Improve Innovations:
Several times in the interview Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he installed some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later on at Apple, he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember some sweeping arguments... They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About large companies that are slowing down:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs anticipated the ways in which so many industrial giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so you're making a better copier or printer, so what?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [they are such people] that ultimately run the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is necessary by the people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products, exterminated - craftsmanship.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the whole computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger if Microsoft could have been in the 1990s...
You've caught defeat from victory.
About Innovation as an Art Form:
"There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... if you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about your subtleties.
You have to do votes, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
In the end, it all boils down to the taste, it all boils down to trying to deal with the best stuff that people have created, and then trying to put these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shamelessly stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
Had it not been for the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws, as court case accepts
On the day the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically dividing question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama's health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the firm to represent the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit brought by 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care that was passed last year by Congress, a law that became a catchword among conservative activists across the US.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour fundamental discussion is expected in March, which will probably boost the presidential struggle in 2012, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand in court and claim that the law is overturned will probably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies supporting the Federalist Society's annual dinner, an established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court had discussed the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, Republican leader in the Senate and a declared opponent of health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending federalist society events for years.
And that's not against moral rules.
In fact, judges exempt themselves from the code of conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge can participate in charity events law of near and other organizations, whereby the judge must not be a speaker, guest of honor or according to the program no guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms related to the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, was sufficient to alert moral and government activists.
"This astounding break with morality and the contrast with the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges lying, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dinnerd in court during a charity event with lawyers with pending proceedings."
Their appearance and support of a fundraising campaign for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they would easily mix court matters with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a Attorney General under the Obama administration when the first legal disputes came to court in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from hearing the case for bias, as she was too committed to defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan does not make any institutions to do this.
Boeing attracts record order of 18 trillion dollars
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 two-passenger aircraft with an option to add 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing is selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It is really a rare news that a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft totals at a record sum of 18 trillion dollars.
Equally unusual is Boeing's client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that Middle East airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 trillion dollars over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced on the weekend its largest contract of all time for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-speed Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also announced it at the 2011 Dubai Aviation Show that it has an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, bringing the total list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves the fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, stock exchange specialist at Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in oil prices, which generally harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country earns from a higher oil price.
This is important as they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural protection," he said.
Emirates' appointment confirms Boeing's leading position in the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep Airbus' competitor SAS at bay, which is attacking dominance with the A350.
Boeing's victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the launch of the largest A350, which is competing directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed in order to gain more confidence after customers had demanded a higher payload and reach.
Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers supported Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race for governor's post.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo from the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, won the race for Governor's post in the Western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday's day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls... they occupied poll booths, built roadblocks... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled in Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just beaten Claderon, who had led the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current governor, came in third place, a severe defeat for the split and unlucky left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still ongoing.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have quit the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, victory strengthens the party, no matter how repulsive the elections in Michoacan seem.
The man who will probably represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will give us a bold look into next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, administrative director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must do "everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that look "unsufferingly" at the difficulties in Europe and said that financial support from Asia's European leadership and resources helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he said to the Financial Times in an interview on the edge of the Mumbai World Economic Forum.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe’s monetary union has experienced a severe debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe is fueling fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls for leading emerging economies to join forces to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - would give European partners in Asia greater negotiating power.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its economy is now suffering from falling exports and the dwindling of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an assignment, because where else can we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no reason to help rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to 1.2 trillion people in India for Europe, of which more than 800 million live from $2 or even less a day.
"Sometimes they will find out that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid public sector employees in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railroad.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crises will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The ADB's forecast of an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/ now threatens "the risk of gradation" due to the impending danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves for a downtrend and significant capital outflow of their words.
Urgent Warnings from the Pentagon about Possible Incisions in Defense
Defense Minister Leon Panetta warmed up Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the war venues in Afghanistan and the civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already thinking about cuts of 450 trillion dollars over the coming decade, but is now afraid that further cuts of 600 trillion dollars or more will become necessary if Congress cannot complete its spending.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said Congress failure to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to so-called seizure, would result in 23% general cuts and a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a high cut, carried out in such a careless manner, would make most of our ship and construction projects impracticable - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with a certain probability in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alert readiness."
The cuts eventually hit the fighting troops," said Panetta.
"While the wartime contingents in the anti-terrorism struggle are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war efforts," Panetta warned.
"Staff recruitment has been cut, leading to delays in recruitment and recruitment supervision that support the war."
"The salaries of the staff would be reduced, leading to late payments to wartime traders and disruption of legal and political support."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for more details on the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently against this draconian act," said the senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result with which we cannot live, and it is certainly not one that should be imposed on us."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings from the senators will increase pressure on a budget compromise or increase demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly outspokenly pronounced the possible cuts, although he has had many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the head of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Minister painted a gloomy picture of what could be ahead - a military with shell, but without core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an Air Force squadron without adequately trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," said Panetta in his opening address in the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to engage with potential opponents."
"She actually makes you get angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta gave new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global capability to deploy and intervene, leading to unacceptable risks in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle that Army and Marine need to replace the Humvee.
If the further development and testing of the F35 were to be stopped, this would save up to 80 trillion dollars over the next 10 years, but supporters say that it is an important next step towards upgrading so that possible dangers can be banished by China and other opponents.
How to Unmask a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy mastering the accusations of sexual harassment on the part of several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying.
Penn State's leadership is accused of perjury because reports have been held back that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself as he circulated denials that were quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of infringing campaign funding related to cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied during his second term at the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about cheating in school and college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers have given their students the exam answers so that they themselves were well-advised in their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that every day we lie between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies, however, are regarded as a lie of necessity.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or "uncovering lies" is one that is important for each person to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as Scharaden, in which the goal is to call "Have You!", the defiling of a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been exposed.
Lies look you in the eye.
They stutter, stammer, blush and do not always blush.
However, it cannot be concluded from this that these liars are difficult to expose and expose.
A trained lie-masker can penetrate to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing area of exposure. And it is clear that defiling a deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us to find justice in our complex world, especially when hiring or questioning people or negotiating or managing is one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people, raising their interest and mastering their own emotions, and they intuitively feel how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people that men are more often "self-directed" lies than women whose lies are more "orienting" - usually protecting the feelings of others - that married people lie less frequently to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when a person has been exposed as an evildoer, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "Baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent assessment of changes.
Watch the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
You should better know when someone usually always jumps with the foot, so they don't blame him wrongly when he jumps with the foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Think of these accumulations as alarm bells that shrill, not evidence of exposure.
People who deceive may freeze when they try to remember their story. Maybe their feet point towards the door or they lean toward the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the interview", this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in posture when all the hard questions are over.
Questioners often falsely signal that an interview is over just to look for this relaxation after the interview.
Also, watch your subject's language.
Scott Peterson's slipper is famous when he used the past form when he claimed his murdered wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceiving persons can also use a distanced language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if one repeats a tricky question in the whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer perceptive rather than objective, which often makes the alarm bells shrill.
There's no magic to expose lies, but you can learn skills that allow you to unmask them.
These skills make it easier for anyone to become a victim of fraud, both in private and professional life.
Controversial Oil Pipeline Plan Revised After Endangering by Delayed US Approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned Canadian oil pipeline into the Gulf of Mexico, which angered the unions and at the same time reassured environmentalists, the company building the pipeline is trying to re-plan the project so that it can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament Building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the Company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This was the case after an announcement by the Foreign Ministry last week that a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course, which would avoid the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala-Aquifer, a large underwater supply, was reviewed.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the State Department and pledged his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline will connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta Province to Texas refineries.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, who are against the plan, weigh the laws to force a departure from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project has little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry states that the Ministry's main auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of allegedly forcing an infant to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle, in the lobby of her Manhattan building, had a bloating attack that scared her little daughter so much that she threw up in fear.
The tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she was suffering from "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was November 10th last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to set off on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk fetched the car, Roseanna Monk went with her luggage and Genevieve on his arm into the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped off her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arms," she said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman furiously.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't put your daughter near the door," Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and started to scold - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to tip water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle rushed at the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be restrained by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby screamed so much that it had to vomit, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no reply.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls requesting an opinion.
The lawsuit is for unspecified damages, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he would not charge a fee and plan the family to donate the money they're getting to the children's cancer relief.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is exposed to a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climatic adversity slowed down the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and undeclared work increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of the change and fuelled great hopes for economic growth, is in government. However, as a result of the climatic adversity, growth cannot be mentioned, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses of millions in agriculture, but also narrowed the limits to the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first quarter of the year.This is mainly due to the historic decline in agricultural development of 31.16 percent, which slowed down further economic sectors.
According to a report published by Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of frost, 582 000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, 78.03 percent of which were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity up to November has led to a steady increase in unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, with 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloa having no employment, equivalent to 4.53 per cent of the labour force. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 per cent and from July to September to 6.19 per cent, resulting in 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa, which is 18 969 more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa in the year goes back to several factors. Economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments that the politics of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are seeing at the moment is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, liquidity losses in the market due to the cuts in funds by the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who are illegally accumulating dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, to invest them or to use them for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased, due on the one hand to the problems of entry and, on the other hand, because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here looking for work here, which causes unemployment to rise," he says.
undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if the high proportion of undeclared work is taken into account. According to INEGI, this includes 60.38 percent of the employees in the country who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work are accompanied by low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Agency for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of employees in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos by September, much less than the general government average of 7375 pesos.
Decrease in FDI
In addition to the reduction in economic activity and rising unemployment, the largest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to Secretaría de Economía (National Economic Authority), the ADI was $630,597 from January to June, a decline of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 143,312 dollars in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Agency for Economic Development) for its part recorded a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debts
In view of the economic crisis, the state government applied to the National Congress in July for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to reactivate the economy. The State Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive impact of debt on any of the country’s economic sectors could be identified by November.
Reactions
For the representatives of the entrepreneurship the first year of government made Mario López Valdé's incapacity for government obvious.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), argued that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the national government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa has been really poor this year, and hard work needs to be done to regain the terrain lost this year and we need to make a double effort in 2012. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already well-coordinated government team have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development more difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slowed economy that is not sufficiently moving to generate an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will complete the year well below our expectations," he said.
Redefining appointments
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana in Sinaloa, said that it was necessary to encourage the state to become more dynamic productive.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the country's economic vocation and line, because it is important to activate all Sinaloa's material and human resources," he said.
There's a lot to do
The chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that would better guide the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas in which one can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 daily sentences for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic's prosecutor's office announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - in this case the commercial possession of marijuana.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during surveillance of the Cipriano Valdez road at guard post No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and in the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the convicted person is still in the detention centre.
Debt for construction work
According to Miguel Ángel López Miranda, the social structures for migrants provided for in the programmes Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 are in danger of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay.
The head of the city's social development agency explained that, although the construction programs are already advanced, they are now in danger, as the state government has not paid the funds it is entitled to, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million pesos, 25 percent of which fell to the state. Until now, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the construction termination is to be expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, even though they had to pay us part already in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that, under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not fulfilled its obligations and that the municipality had to borrow 7 million at the beginning of its reign, which would correspond to the amount that the central government would have had to pay.
"We had already done so in the last parliamentary term, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued to run and this year we had to obtain the funds that the state had not raised to participate in these programmes," he said.
Although the public authorities were obliged to pay out these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance, , had requested that the administrative work be speeded up and that the outstanding share be paid out as soon as possible.
"Almost 12 million have to contribute, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny."
The court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico in 2015
The transition of analogue to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional actions filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, and by virtue of which the switch from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must be brought forward due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the legislative decree detailing the switchover to terrestrial digital television.
This resolution rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate because it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
In the case brought by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed that the Decree-Law be declared unconstitutional, since the regulations relating to radio and television are the responsibility of the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), which is why the Decree-Law would be contrary to the hierarchical principles and the legal requirements.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree. After the lawsuits were accepted, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Legislative Decree and ceased all activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the project, which was also the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the country government should not regulate the measures that the public administration should take under general rules.
"I also do not believe that if this were done, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also recalled that the central government is responsible for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because the central government is responsible for state affairs.
Replacing analogue signals with digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it makes better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased signal quality and more channels.
The postponement of the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the exploitation of digitalisation, which was a decision in the public interest that had not only technical aspects, "because it included economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "needed the action of the entire system, according to the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of characteristics that put the constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already made the digital transition, through the government, even though they had highly specialised facilities.
It could not be concluded that the government would intervene in the powers of Congress by issuing the contested decree, since the laws adopted by the legislature would be complied with," she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballot papers individually in Michoacán is being considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of counting the ballots individually this year is a reality at the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governorial elections is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this spirit, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November 9th the polling post had adopted a series of regulations to harmonise local regulations with state reforms in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, electoral law, or electoral justice law to the reforms adopted by Congress, so that they had not entered into force during this election round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Gazette within the time limits set for this, arguing that he had no objection to it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional action filed by the local legislature and judged the State Commissioner's vote on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal", as he did not have the right to "decide or veto it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal, in an interview on the possibility of individual counting of votes, explained that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there is now the possibility that the local electoral authority can count the ballots in part or in full.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted.The results in the minutes do not agree; the minutes on the counting and calculation of votes are not available on file or are not in the possession of the chairman of the election committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total counting of the complete ballot certificates may be made if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the second-place winner, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the above-mentioned candidates.
The total number of votes may also be counted if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that an explicit application is made by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the electoral packages subject to a partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is just under 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
Its ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés poured down on Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday evening. On Monday, the show of the dead and a mass of the dead took place.
According to family members, the lieutenant colonel's last will was to spread his ashes over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila together with the others killed in the accident in a plane of the Mexican Air Force. The colonel's closest persons participated in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant colonel landed in the mourning hall, which is located on Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came from.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology. This mortuary show was initiated by his former classmates from the technical high school and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio belonged during his preparation for the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and spread his ashes over the Zapalinamé Mountains. He had always said so to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, extraordinary as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, because they thought it would make him dizzy even on a truck. Nevertheless, he always strived to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good person. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to greet him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán to graduate his family member. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: to fly a plane.
A Last Farewell
The lieutenant-colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was honoured by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, principals and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and was distinguished by both his studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority also sat, crashed.
At 6:05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the forecourt of the barracks. There, his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers, were already waiting for him.
The abandoned corpse was found on a plot of land on the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military personnel introduced eleven people to the media who had been arrested in the same village in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by gunshots in different parts of the body and a shot of mercy in an abandoned finca in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at kilometre 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passers-by saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood wide open.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people inside about three meters away, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow t-shirt and dark trousers, without shoes; next to him was another dressed with a white top.
The body of another person with a red T-shirt and blue trousers lay just a few feet away.
All three were on their stomachs.
According to the information received on the spot, the three persons must have been murdered in another place, as no shell casings were found.
On the wall of the country house inscriptions are to be read, which one organized criminal gang writes to another, in addition several shots were found in wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defense) presented 11 people, including a minor who was part of a criminal gang mainly active in the town of Cadereyta, associated with kidnappings, murders, halconeo (hunting people) and secret funerals.
According to the public information, eight people were arrested and one prisoner freed at the Los Alveros settlement on 11 November.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured, and the arrested confirmed that they were members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12, at 6:00 a.m., military officers found a car with no license plates and two passengers on their watch lap in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13, at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the community of La Frauda, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
They are charged with secret burials in the towns of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday formation of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government, which is to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government, which is to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the Presidential Palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed of a majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said he would present the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of government to the President.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well-stacked," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has brought the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package that was called for by Europolitics in order to regain the weak confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti to press ahead has been exacerbated by the fluctuating market situation, which has led to the interest burden on Italian government bonds for 10 years at a rate of 7 per cent, which is the level at which Greece and Ireland have been forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of Confindustria, informed the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government by all means."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are designed to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a government consisting of a majority of technocrats, which is currently forming Monti.
Support from Parliament
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or delaying reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also exerting pressure to suggest that Monti's failure is a disaster.
Monti began its debates on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as youth and women's organisations.
The meeting will be closed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who set in motion an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief reverberation at the end of last week, when it was known that Berlusconi would resign, the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister has again reached critical limits for the cost of the Italian government bonds.
Saving Italy with a sovereign debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said that his government must last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, rather than prefer the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in the light of the procedure imposed by pressure from the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of people from political life.
Spaniards have more gaming opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on their hump.
From Costa Rica's side, only one of the 22 invited players has 50 games behind them.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the friendly match held today at 3:05 p.m. in the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, the number one in FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of class A competitions, the three-coloured team has only defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international matches.
He reached this number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have every year the opportunity to participate in numerous home matches (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, there are the experiences with the Spanish Fury at complicated elimination matches at the Eurocup and the World Cups.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international matches in the context of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We'll see how the Spanish team draws their last register: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who reached a tie with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta last Saturday against England (deputy 0-1 in London) with 126 matches abroad.
Today Casillas will play against the three-color team and Spain will record a new record of 127 international matches.
Xavier Hernández, player of Barcelona Football Club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition last week from UEFA, along with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the mid-stormer of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol is also approaching the number one hundred with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side forward Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the forward Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there, only five games were played: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The one with the least games.
Less than 30 games are played by Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
The team plays less than 30 games, including Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even come close to the 20's.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, Víctor Bolívar has only one in Costa Rica and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is realized"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
More than 20 years were expected, but the band assures that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bass player and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium from 7.30 p.m. together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the interview, the full copy of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realized for us.
This is just the second time we have played in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I have only been to Costa Rica once for a holiday. It is such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted. They experience the days before the concert intensively.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry to have taken so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've played in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on some huge shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are excited about the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for surfing. Together with Mexico, these are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we also set ourselves no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes a different song, so the decision we're going to play is not easy.
If we record two or three songs that we haven’t played for a long time, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they might be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think that's why it's also for the audience.
With this tour you are celebrating your twenty-year history.
When you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagined playing in a great rock band for more than 20 years. It looks like a dream.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are excited about producing music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be any better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then a band comes out of a city, but it is unusual for five or ten groups to come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are still looking forward to being friends with them all and it honors us to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I think that we are all lucky to be alive and besides, we take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn’t get any better.
Your relationship to fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to fall into this game with huge crowds of people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came for the music, it reminds you that you have to watch the music and what it has brought into being without being obsessed with being a famous rock star. We never cared about that anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
For three years we were a band that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built up the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why the band chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band the best. Therefore, we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live.
Why do you always change Yellow Ledbetter's lyrics when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he can think of.
Who were you influenced by as a bass player?
Of so many+
The first to come up with it are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fad?
I don't think we all feel very attached to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think about the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think it’s great, because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are doing better music now than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a little frivolous, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they have something positive in themselves.
The tears came to me when I heard Ed playing them. They are very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, when you lose a family member or a friend - that influences your artistic work and your music and these two songs clearly embody this for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his family doctor informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years in prison for violation of human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is operated and controlled four times.
Alejandro Aguinaga, congressman and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days in the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish for this because he considered him innocent.
He was operated four times on tongue cancer and he lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition, there are other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía detention centre since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the Peruvian Army's death squad, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the President of Uruguay, this will be the highlight of his busy schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the Uruguayan collective living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", announced the presidentship of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón's support for the incident with France when French head of government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that still act as tax havens, which Uruguay rejected and prompted a request from his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and industrialised countries. Since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the implementation of tax information exchange agreements in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not adopted all international tax cooperation standards.
Since 2004, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay at business level, which has contributed to a growing trade in goods between the two countries.
The purr-bearded installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
For 25 years Super Mario has fought tirelessly for the rescue of Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which comes this month to the counters of all the world, has been tailored from the beginning to the characteristics of the portable console Nintende 3DS, with which can be played three-dimensionally without a special glasses.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, responsible for the Nintendo-specialized press in Spain, at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game developed for this console from the very beginning" , because until now successful articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adaptations of already existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman underlined that although it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "affordable" video game that allowed for a fast, fluid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "light" to capture the less-spiced users.
After that, the experts can spin a "second round" over the different levels of games that are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, in order to overcome the obstacles without becoming victims of the "optical effects", they must always play three-dimensionally.
This trip of Super Mario into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the Saga and repeats the recipe for success of recent editions: The purr-bearded installer must overcome dangerously-picked platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news in the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would allow the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to take responsibility in the United States for the US $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
Thus the trial of the US application for extradition of Portillo ends, so that it can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that he had not interfered with court decisions during his government and had accepted all extradition requests he had been notified of.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is being extradited for murder and assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's action is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited when his legal situation is clarified in Guatemale and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for embezzling 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his reign. This trial preceded extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organisation was set up to avoid the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social assistance organisation Trinijove have led to important results: in this quarter century, 6000 young people threatened with social exclusion were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are over a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event was held yesterday in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was set up in 1986 in the district of Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems at risk of marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by many leaders of institutions and institutions who worked with the association during these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives from different directions during election campaigns demonstrated the impartiality of Trinijove's work.
Besides the president of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former socialist minister of education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green city councillor Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and Jaume Lanaspa, Director General of the Social Works of La Caixa Savings Bank.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was born in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is "a good basis".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulties.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does," he explained.
Occupied house where giant parties were held was cleared
The owners of the house had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without any resistance.
Everything points to the fact that the nightmares of the neighbors of house No. 51 on the street Balmes have found an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building, which they had illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge festivals, which had driven the neighborhood to despair. The evacuation took place by judicial order without police intervention.
After the eviction, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be checked," confirmed the house manager.
The squatters, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took with them the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. Moreover, they had painted the walls and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had decreased by 80% since the beginning of the occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the squatters made their unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure place had been reported by the neighbors for disturbance of rest, while according to her statement the noise did not originate from the visitors of the disco, but from the squatters and in particular from the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and which according to the angry neighbors became more and more in recent weeks.
The discotheque's manager explained that the harassment had been so severe that she agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that she had received more complaints from her neighbours in recent weeks.
Last week, the chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in Barcelona's City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, called for the building to be cleared immediately and the problems of civil coexistence and of the urban area to be tackled.
He explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before the summer, but that the squatters had penetrated all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments in the last few months. In some of them there had even been theft.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against the anti-social acts in the building."
Yesterday another building in the Nou Barris district was evacuated by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., the police approached Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people entering the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the disputes over fees, the architects agree to the tender.
The urban tender for the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona anew.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its defamation on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers with New York Central Park.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became the upper limit of Barcelona again in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in the north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
The role model was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the yogi bear.
This was the time when the city issued a huge invitation to tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that's the way it is, or someone's planning to put gates in the country.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, Park or Berg?
The call is not only from an organisational point of view, but also in view of a reflection on the city the topic of discussion in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is already almost a recurring topic, which two members of this old settled caste, who meet in the elevator, can fall back on.
And that is exactly the fact that offers the material for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it and some university professors who applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, it is "necessary" to speak about the "front of the mountain" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, the one about the green apples, has not been conducted.
"One should assume the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Tore of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": it must not be imagined as "access to a park, but as a limitation of areas in which action must be taken."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in urban planning, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Risks arising from the "uncertainty that the design of a public space today entails" after the experience of the 1980s, who had their "swan song" in the field of the forum.
The first fear is one's own limitation to what can be built up.
"Limiting something always means setting the next step", i.e. crossing it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the present [referring to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who adheres more closely to the question, says that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "fall on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration that it has given its committee the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountains to the city is the escort letter, which allows architects to take part in the debate, although he expresses his "doubt" about whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams created ("just the right thing," he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, since in the terms of the tender a global view of Collserola is missing: "There were 16 competitions in the cross-section," he says, "on the axis of the mountain-sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area in its entirety."
This has led, at least in his case, to his participation in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, which creates a soft transition between town and green areas.
Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the representative of Casino Red freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial being conducted against him for alleged extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the representative of Casino Red has given him to the Second Criminal Court of the district, which is leading the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás, who allegedly forced him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration would approve the secret operation of the betting house.
After the lawsuit, the prosecution opened a criminal case against the brother of the Panist mayor, who was arrested for 30 days on September 2nd.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He remained there 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after Ministerio Público's official rejected the crimes of bribery and organised crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Detention Centre because he allegedly bribed the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. However, he stayed only a few hours in the media security wing, as there were threats of murder against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an inmate of the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, Jorge Yánez, secretary of the District's Second Criminal Court, sent him a prison order stating that, after almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to make Jonás guilty of paying the House's representatives 1.5 million pesos in exchange for opening it.
This Monday, the representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina to punish the mayor's brother, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the court-affiliated Ministerio Público, asked García Gómez whether he had corrected the damage and who had declared his forgiveness to the owner of the betting house. However, the lawyer held the name back.
In accordance with Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is free to speak, and in the following, no objections can be lodged against the trial and no compensation is required.
After hearing the representative of the competition house at 3:50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison to tell Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the court order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details of the aircraft accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transporte - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident, in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people were killed, indicate that the helicopter with all its intact structure has crashed directly against the ground without the pilot could have initiated an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before take-off that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller blades were in contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, with the helicopter losing the fuselage, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it met all the requirements for transporting the personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found in the field where the machine had run down.
"In the search no aircraft parts were found in other places, the impact concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to get the results as soon as possible, but this could take several months, perhaps even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, General Director of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Relief Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter had flown from the Estado Mayor Presidencial at cruising speed and that the aircraft had fallen to a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of impact."
At a press conference, the head of SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of visual flight. This means that the crew must have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at take-off. During the continuing flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some low-hanging clouds arose.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with better visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley because of the clouds.
Impact point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar record of the helicopter match. There may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or any deviation from the flight route prior to the impact.
Dispersal of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter was impacted from the straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered remains of the aircraft suggests that the helicopter had hit the ground with its intact structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft do not indicate fire or explosion at the scene of the accident.
The latest results indicate several ground contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is sloping and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter was probably broken.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a minute search in an area that went beyond the restricted area at the scene of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the intact aircraft structure had bounced against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol for finding the gene for obesity
The Mexican Social Security Institute is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is leading a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth" with which the genetic markers are to be found in connection with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was set up.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate programme at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports grounds of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are carried out every Saturday from 8.00 am.
He stressed that the investigation began on the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and continued on the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) since 8 October.
Once the target of 500 to 600 investigators has been reached, the study will be continued on the sports field of Independencia (south of the capital district) and completed on the one of Morelos (north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn about the factors and role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors for Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global diabetes day, he said that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 should fill out nutrition-related questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and family history in order to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He also pointed out that on the aforementioned Saturdays, the subjects were measured (weight, size, waist size), their blood pressure and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (try to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out in the light of health staff's concern about the alarming weight gain for young people.
"The health surveys conducted in 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years the proportion of obese boys had increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent. Obesity had also increased dramatically," stressed the specialist of the IMSS.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of Mexico's population differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that a Mexican (e) was 65 percent Indian-American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African, on average, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess of energy (calories) that we have taken, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants in the study was a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin wrinkles in the neck and inner arm (akanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information will be kept confidential and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors will explain all the results of the measurements to the parents and suggest changes in their lifestyle that are appropriate for the prevention of illnesses.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors that are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, i.e. an increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.), along with a high intake of fat and protein, as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM, develops polymer-modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs from the road surface were to be observed, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200,000 potholes when the rainy season breaks out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (Mexico Valley City Area), Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warned and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt surface would be adequately damaged, the number of potholes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his presentation "Tapholes from a Technical Perspective", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing polymer-modified asphalt to produce a mixture similar to that of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Mr. Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road surface and thus avoid the occurrence of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of oil - is a hydrocarbon compound of which one part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphaltenes - and the other part a low - the so-called Malthene. Together they give the road surface its characteristic viscous elastic behaviour.
Elastic behaviour of the asphalt means that at high temperatures of almost 180°C it behaves like a liquid, at 120°C it is very viscous and at 50°C almost firm, while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," said the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher noted that the majority of the streets in Mexico City had a flexible pavement composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which contained asphalt.
Between the top layers lay a layer of asphalt, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer had been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move on to it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"On top of the wear layer," he explained, "a last layer is laid out, the so-called bearing layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they have to produce friction.
That this road surface receives and distributes the most forces, the bearing layer also requires an adequate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to be taken into account, especially water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes wet, water penetrates the layer and is difficult to escape again. This causes all layers of the road surface to soften and consequently the occurrence of potholes.
When a pothole is created," he said, "the cover layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but is a process that should be maintained by appropriate maintenance programs at the first signs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause of the occurrence of potholes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be proportional to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that a great deal of research was still to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries, and with which the potholes could be repaired easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What was the candidate del Valle missing to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that had the effect that Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14th disenfranchisement.
Once again Valle del Cauca went empty in the award of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with being on the winning podium, a silver crown and the tape that identifies her as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department already comes to 14 mistitles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in their hands. Among the proclaimed misses are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many are asking today is: What was missing?
Because the result is the decline of a great favourite who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. It was not for nothing that she had been elected Queen of the Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had also received, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor that is considered crucial for the jury's decision to appoint her First Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "Which book has influenced you most and why?" that Martín Murillo Gómez had asked her by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I pretty much believe in literature, I think it's a way of civilizing, in the end I think that the book that was the most influential for my childhood is 'The Little Prince', a rather deep-going book.
At the moment I am reading 'guilt and atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian woman, a beautiful book called 'passion'.
An answer that met with little love, firstly because of the concept of 'civilizing' and secondly because it had not explained in concrete terms how each book she mentioned had influenced her.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what needs to happen.
And for all people, please read 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle has burned out.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the favourite who had all the incidents and had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy competition Easter, public vote on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates jealous, which stressed the queen, which could not shine on stage."
And you could see that at her first performance in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at her two lifts at the coronation party.
Although she performed safely with both of them, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition does not eventually become Queen".
In addition, Valle went out of the way of the press at the end - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jurie about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will have its reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty explained that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, on the fact that she had already worked on projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of derriere and fibrosis, which was noticed in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The trainer of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there would be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the stomach, which was frankly hardly noticeable to me, pushed her score the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the woman from Valle del Cauca’s mistake was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to do them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay."
Because of this prize, which was awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, after the appearance in the bathing suit, a cruel prediction was made, which was supposed to come true at night. It was whispered that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina will begin her reign as of today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia on the nomination of the National Beauty Competition at one of the international competitions.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who had escaped the crown despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena.
Thus was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopeist from Cali went down in history as the man who identified Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4th, a Lophoscopeist from the Criminal Investigation Unit (CTI) from Cali, who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia), admitted: "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopeists in the CTI department, Eliazar González was on standby this week, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities in Chocó, where he often had to go into the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was to identify were located.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
During the week of the attack against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big awaited him.
Friday night he flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one of the men who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world could be. Therefore, he should take the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached with the examiner the place where the body was located, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was not in the least similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a plant ladle and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: It was Alfonso Cano.
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was actually the head of the FARC.
Searching for Traces
For a dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the tribute given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
The dactyloscopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopeists not only identify corpses, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many offenders submit false identification papers or have none.
We'll take their fingerprints and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house during a theft, because the thief had supported himself with his hand right here when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
The fingerprints can also be used to relieve or burden murder suspects.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspect, and in fact a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, he is nevertheless associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A Dactyloscopician of the CTI explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents are taken from the object."
When they appear, a plant ladle or band is used to take them with you.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the civil status office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identity papers," explained the expert from the CTI.
He said that not everything was as depicted in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "indignants" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents on Zuccotti Square.
Most of them followed the eviction order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged the authorities of New York this Tuesday when they again tried to enter Manhattan Square with a judicial order after being cleared from the square at dawn and trying to occupy another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to gain access with a judicial order allowing the "indignants" to re-camp at this point. Meanwhile, another part of the movement adhered to the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where nine arrests took place.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will gather in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the Ocupy Wall Street movement.
Bray explained that the response of the "indignants" to the clearing of their camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order forbidding the forced clearance of the square and allowing the protesters to camp.
In addition, the "indignants" occupied a new park, which is located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, and is property of Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but after that the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not give exact figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he had also seen several journalists with handcuffs among them.
The organization affirms that hundreds of people have gathered at this place, where a delegation of religious leaders has also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square (a private property site) remains closed pending a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday to analyse the legality of the eviction that took place at dawn.
Some of the demonstrators driven from the square carried photocopies of this court order and distributed them. They even gave them to some policemen who were guarding the square, resulting in "some small clashes," as Bray reported, who had reported that some police had beaten demonstrators.
The judicial order forbids the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street from the square as well as the application of "laws passed after the occupation and prohibit the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that due to this judicial order the reopening of the square to the public and the demonstrators had been lifted. He pointed out to the demonstrators that the city laws did not allow them to set up again with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the eviction of Zuccotti Square at dawn, where almost 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators "prone against the law."
Bloomberg stated that he had given the order to clear the place because it had "turned into a place where people did not come to protest, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm others", because "some businesses had received threats" and the residents "feared for their quality of life".
"The clearing at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of North American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting press freedom."
Occupy Wall Street officials informed that they were thinking about organizing "great actions" for Thursday, along with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been going on since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas Show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Canadian television Christmas show.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities will appear on December 1 in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
Today, CTV distributed pictures of the television program in which Anderson - also for the distribution on the Internet of a self-made porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap, which is supposed to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently worked as a moderator on Charlie Sheen's show "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as a child of Jesus.
CTV's Christmas program not only relies on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far away from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé had called the North American Kim Kardashian "whore".
Japan Reborn After the Earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still recovering from the destructive earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst catastrophe Japan had experienced during World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government estimated the damage to property at $300,000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of time, data on gross domestic product from July to September were finally used to complete this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% compared to the annual rate.
The figure measured in the second quarter - the business year in Japan starts in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained in part by the machine sales for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the fall of 0.9% for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the real change in the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynisian impulses that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has been awakened by the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by growing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - has fled into one of the "currencies of refuge" of investors fleeing from the eurozone's debt crisis and the gloomy forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that weighs like a gravestone on the export companies' accounts.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the Yen.
While the markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"One must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the Yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy yesterday.
The prospects are really not very uplifting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States showed clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, showed that the biggest economic powers would have put a brake on it.
For it sank by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average of 100 after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens gives rise to doubt again
Papadimos says the austerity measures will be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the increased risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece is also further lost in the maze that is emerging from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is a reaction to the pressure from Brussels rather than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly being proved by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days he had agreed to appoint were perhaps too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured him that he would support the new austerity measures and would in no way withdraw his demand for new elections on the scheduled date, 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform the disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not dispel doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but to nothing else."
The conservative leader went one step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism that needs to unlock the 8000 million that Athens desperately needs, and made it clear that he would not endorse any commitment to meet the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand must not be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "did not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the Troika would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed for the payment of the sixth section" in the amount of 8000 million euros, although there is still no final date.
The Greek ball still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "predominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades Spain has become the world's second donor of this instrument for international cooperation. His "being" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity on the basis of trust in people".
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the fifth World Summit on microcredit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular, the target of the number of people who have to live with income of less than one dollar a day, i.e. below the "poverty limit".
Spain "continues to work" on the extension of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it is carrying out this task responsibly", said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will start from the summit, which will last until Thursday, "will guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "face many challenges."
The summit on microcredit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for launching "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen stated that it was intended that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty line.
In Spain and the rest of the world, the concept of microcredit goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia considers to be an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financial instrument as an "admirable idealist committed to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about the local loan strategy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings at Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We have observed a continuous development," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project brought her yesterday's assessment as the "Head of the Family" in Valladolid and as the "Proponent of the Poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her lecture by encouraging those present to take part in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to tie development aid to times of economic booms because it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez felt that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty", and that the governments of the industrialised countries now had to work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success", "marginized" people "always standing in front of closed doors" to give "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU) on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig was without real difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was originally not foreseen in the programme, but was established in the autumn, in particular in order to satisfy those activists who consider government policy on the Greeks to be too lax today and possibly Italy tomorrow.
The European Commission's proposal for a presidency proposed by the Bureau was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The standing ovation, which lasted for several minutes, which was initially valid for Angela Merkel and several hours later Wolfgang Schäuble due to their intervention decrees, left no doubt on the part of the three European finance ministers.
The Chancellor's main idea - as well as the request - is the following: the answer to the crisis is "no less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in a modification of the Lisbon Treaty, which reinforces the control of the European Union as regards the countries' budgetary policies in the euro area, but could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote" to give Europe a face".
However, this is definitely one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which were clearly supported by Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is not likely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone has been set.
Similarly, the delegates, in an overwhelming majority, rejected the proposal of weighting each country on the ECB Executive Board according to the weighting of individual economies, which would obviously lead to a strengthening of Germany's position.
The Chancellor, who is concerned about calming the climate within her party, has therefore reinforced the points of reference for Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or European countries in difficulty, who would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
As far as the European request devotes a paragraph to the significance of the "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that two centuries ago Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in sick reports?
After the family benefits, UMP and the government are now starting to report the illness.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, in order to visit a family allowance fund and present a speech on the theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to put the economy in a tough test, but which on the other hand is no less the harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to concentrate on workers' health reports.
First of all with budgetary objectives: the government aims to introduce a fourth day of waiting before taking into account a report of illness among employees in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the salary of four days without permission from the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure, which according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos" threatens to provoke anger, but would help to contribute 280 million euros.
And this would be accompanied by another measure of a more symbolic character: to grant the civil servants an unpaid leave in the event of illness (to date, unlike the three days of leave in the private sector, there is no waiting period for them).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority are also rekindling the subject of fraud, this time aimed at the abuse associated with absence of work.
"Controls will be much more important, and they will also have to be remunerated if required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November, in front of the RTL station's microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this notification on the reality of fraudulent activities in the area of sickness reports seems to be somewhat disproportionate.
Indeed, since 2002, this has been the subject of permanent observation and political offensives that have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer sick more frequently than people elsewhere in Europe.
First, however, let us stick to the national figures.
According to the State Sickness Fund CNAM, more than 237 million euros of daily severance payments were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of Health Care, daily severance payments in 2008 amounted to 5 % of health expenditure, amounting to 11.3 billion euros.
This figure was 46% for maternity leave, accidents at work and 54% for sick leave, i.e. €6.2 billion.
And so 2.5% of health expenditure.
According to a study carried out by the Alma Consulting Group, in 2010, only 14.5 days of sick leave were granted to the French on average compared to the 17.8 days in 2009.
A mean that covers up certain differences: another one, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40.000 surveyed French workers stated that they had not taken a single day of illness.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of the health reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared with its European neighbours, therefore, French workers no longer tend to be incapacitated than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (illness or otherwise) oscillated, ranging from 10% to 11% in France to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in the event of illness is a very small proportion in terms of undeclared work.
In terms of fraud, only a small amount is achieved.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that there are systmatic controls in cases of illness that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public University for the Training of Technicians and Engineers) found that under 1.5 million controls, 13% of the 285,000 short-term medical reports realized were "unjustified or too long" in 37,050 cases.
In the case of more than 45 days of systematic control of illness reporting cases, less than 1.2 million 11% of "unadapted or unjustified" cases were reported, i.e. 132,000.
Thus, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reported to several million workers who have filed a complaint.
A figure which represents only a weak measure against, for example, those of undeclared work.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of a factual report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the deframation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needed a new adjustment programme to intercept its economy.
This had been announced on Monday, 14 November, by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament, adding that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to carry out this task.
"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of government in his first public speech in opening the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro-summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the Eurozone was "at stake", he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's government deficit "by the 9%" of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new austerity measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent to the measures already approved concerning an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but had sent forward that his party would not be prepared for an additional austerity measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a congress of his New Democracy party.
He had agreed to the targets of reducing the budget deficit and debt, as well as fighting waste, but he was hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without the written guarantee of all parties to support the planned measures, had replied to Antonio Samaras that his word was sufficient and he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalised, according to a panel of experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, reports the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, even beyond cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal to die.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, linked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the penal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia, where this choice is made, in patients considered capable of making such a decision.
As a starting point, the experts cite a recently published survey of the independent society EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the subject of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to analgesics, so the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada tell us.
And despite the Canadian majority desire to die at home, 68.6% of them ultimately die in the hospital.
From a country-wide perspective, the rate is highest in Quebec at 86% of hospital deaths.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not intend to make any changes to the penal law on euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would result in abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanying suicide by uncompetent or unwilling persons.
On the contrary, there are many more cases of such violations, particularly in countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Even accompanied suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians support euthanasia
Let us bear in mind that, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already declared their support for euthanasia, since they believe that it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact that euthanasia is legalised does not mean that they convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
With regard to those who have already committed an accompanying suicide, 41% of the respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or cessation of treatments in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the withdrawal of the funds for which a legally valid rejection has been made should not be considered criminal.
The Panel also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the end-of-life loss of funds without fear of criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, even beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the remedies already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, the Panel calls for pain relief or life-enhancing measures to be considered at least, as they did not serve to reduce physical pain and refer to the same procedures as euthanasia.
Reservations from other experts
Some experts in the field of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has called the attitude of the report signing experts among other things "extreme", since this sets no limits to euthanasia practice for the sick in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation in which everyone who is tired and older than 18 years of age asks another person to help him commit suicide," said Rashamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place individual responsibility above all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there are "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she described as the "Pro-Euthanasia Manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular doubts the reporting on the absence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and associated suicide are legalised, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the authorities of the foreign ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria's Bashar al-Assad, which, however, resists it thanks to Russia's support and rejects a "complot" directed against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before Syria was excluded by the Arab League, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, despite Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbours, taking a position in favor of President Assad’s resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the acting Arab Prime Minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "depose his power in Syria" in which about forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"If Bashar had his country's interest in the heart, he would resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, Syria's neighbour, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, lamented that the Turkish mediation attempts aimed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must leave," he said, alluding to Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey is taking a steadily harsher attitude.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "enhancement of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have set an ever-increasing tone in the face of repression in Syria," observes Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Department of State.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the Dar'a region in southern Syria have died, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH announced.
According to this NGO, two other civilians had died in the besieged city of Homs during "fire changes and heavy bomb attacks around Jobar".
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless considered that the country "taxes towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has reacted emphatically to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considers to be a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not give in," he added, under the assurance that "the plots forged against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé also spoke out in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from the regime's repression, which encases themselves after him in his "paranoia".
An extra-scheduled new League meeting is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis plan adopted on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, probable withdrawal of the military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described the Arab League's decision yesterday as "uncorrect" in order to avoid supporting possible sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, future head of the Italian government, has demanded a little more time from the markets in order to form his staff and implement a program that "victims" demand in order to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to appoint a cabinet to the parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme involving a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, MEP of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had to wait for Mario Monti to give Parliament a vote of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by Mr Monti of a list of deletions, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of the stock market and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government program, he stressed, under the remark that it would be "certain that the markets will show themselves stupid and discreet".
His appointment by the President was welcomed at the beginning by the markets, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The current Prime Minister should set up a staff made up of mainly technocrats, although he had stressed that he would also like to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive the proof of confidence of the parliament by Friday.
Since taking up his role, Mr Monti has committed himself to working urgently in the spirit of the objective of making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson for Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change even in the light of the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budget balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has in particular requested new tough measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, head of the Italian chiefs, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic recovery, since a country with no growth whatsoever cannot respect deficit indicators".
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epoch change" in Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" and "another Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown here would be the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy will now have to pay 200 billion euros for state bonds until April 2012.
Russian scientist helps Iranian nuclear energy program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-grade detonator, confirmed Monday an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Agency for Nuclear Safety (AIEA) and other documents originating from this UN agency to identify this scientist.
AIEA last week reported its "serious concern" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, apparently had worked for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
He is said to have left the centre in 1989 or 1991 to set up a company in Kiev that produces "nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Prior to his return to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA referred to "strong indications that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive system" had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only highly skilled in this technique, but also, as one member of the agency reported, had worked his entire professional career on this technology directly on the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin via indispensable."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racially or religiously motivated violent crimes have either declined slightly or increased only slightly in the same period, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, whereas there was a 13% increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes directed against Jews and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" had risen to 6,628 cases in a very weak scale, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a slowdown in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," stressed the human rights organization Human Rights First."The rise in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had for a long time stressed that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of the law against human rights," added Paul Legendre, a leader of the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, assessing that this could be done by improving the police attitude towards "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" is presented in American federal law as a legacy from the epoch of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been passed after Martin Luther King's death to punish acts of violence directed against race, skin color, religion or descent and now also includes crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter transforms the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to enable its users, in particular, to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, making the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new "Activity" tab and another "Name" allow better readable live tracking of the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") are tracked and who track your messages.
This makes it possible to find out whether they allow their messages to be tracked, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested on a small percentage of users before its general Internet distribution on Monday "in August", said Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner in front of the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, endowed with something esotheric-looking wording (RT for the referenced repetition of another person's contribution). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users discussed this innovation via the Internet with the help of certain "tweets".
"This is useless, intrusive and is too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The "Activity" function will help me to better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entry of a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution
The government of the large Social Democratic/Christian Democratic coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also avoid any degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top credit rating (AAA).
It was the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian public debt is at 74.6%, far above the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had not fallen to AA+, we would have to pay an additional three billion euros each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister.
Austria also makes a request at the Brussels summit of the euro area Member States on 26 October: the Heads of State or Government would have called for the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 as well as a return to the public balance of accounts in the Constitution or by adopting an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government for this purpose is similar to the "German model" since Germany had been the first European country to have incorporated such a "rule" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017, the state's structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas regional states and municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The objective is to eliminate budgetary debt under the 60% criterion established by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Strong yen
Noda threatens a new intervention in the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that if the Yen continued to rise, Japanese authority would intervene again in the currency markets.
"Should we find excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen," we will intervene just as we did the last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen again jumped close to the historic levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31st.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold yen against dollars to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is about to set a new record value since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has risen regularly, doped by purchases of investors who see the yen as a "destiny value" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was quoted around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese motto harms the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the cost of the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast)," says M. Noda, who fears that this inflation of the Yen can already kill the weak upswing in the bud.
With growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - the third world economic power has again gained traction for the first time this year thanks to the jump in exports and the consumption of households "sealed" by the catastrophe.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the inflation of the yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
For its part, Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to dispel the Yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, has, however, informed that the BoJ has already initiated "appropriate measures", thereby making it clear that no additional currency easing is to be expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to clear the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of cover it had spent on various purchases of financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
Euro-zone:
Fast rates of interest up, stock markets are pulling back
The contagion risk of the debt crisis is constantly undermining European key figures.
Despite the new heads of government taking office in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are drifting into negative areas this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions in government bond yields in the eurozone in difficulty, global equity markets continue to release part of their recent profits.
"Capital investors are nervous and are only too well aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which for its part suffers from the renewed fear of market participants regarding the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis would continue, had closed with a baisse of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe, and trade is on a limited range of variations as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone is damaging the single currency, which continues its bailout on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for one and a half months.
Around 10 o'clock the European Valuta was worth 1.3570 dolls, so it gave in by 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it has declined after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered in Congress on Monday, approved a request that specifically provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The interest rates on loans from Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the return on Italian bonds reached 6.85% for 10 years, while that of the Spanish titles reached 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel investor fears.
The future Italian head of government, Mario Monti, called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, which was threatened by paralysis due to the debt burden.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Eurozone summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the visir of the markets, as the parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread of interest rates between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new historical high.
Looking forward to growth in the euro-zone
Statistically, France recorded economic growth driven by household consumption of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office (INSEE) revised the figures for the second quarter with a reduction of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In reality, it is the fourth quarter that worries economic experts the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first projection of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., while the EU Commission warns against the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
Availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to have an election meeting to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, an enormous proportion of the world's population should not have to renounce a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources must be mitigated in order to continue to produce electricity constantly, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to fight against climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to forego nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which submits its decision to the need to find a substitute source for substitution, nor in Switzerland, which just intends to build nuclear power plants of the last generation.
The UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
After Fukushima, the United States has decided to add another unit to their park by restarting the Three Mile Island plant, which was closed after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model, which is oriented towards renewable energy sources, is sometimes presented as a model, reality contradicts the discourse.
The Berlin election will take the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, in particular on Russia, due to increased use of imported gas, and an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will already be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives cause for reflection.
Denmark is, on the one hand, the European leader in wind energy, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, and, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
As the price of energy in the globalised economy is a key element of competitiveness and a guarantee of stability for industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage due to the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong increase in the price of energy, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys have shown that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are just as unwilling to pay, as it shows resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Let us bear in mind that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125,000 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a plethora of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France decided to withdraw from nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual EUR 6 billion in exports of capital goods and nuclear energy would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would commission an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the decline of his producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one has to admit that there is no more a miracle tool for generating electricity than a devil's work.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy demonstrate the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a safety authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent checks on existing plants, such as at the construction site in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the safety concept.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, namely in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, without consequences for man and the environment.
At Chernobyl, the drama was provoked by reactor construction and infinite human error.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented proportions that caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it did after the previous two.
As a result of this approach and a cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a design that enables it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power itself.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party leaders dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had titled itself.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students by the authorities had shaped the weekly shows, the Interior Minister had casually (see Libération of 23 May) announced that France "had no need for talent, bricklayers or waiters from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right hand side, the tone of Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", on the left hand side by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990 that "France cannot absorb all the world's poverty".
The only difference is the degree of generosity
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was divided in 2005 from both right and left.
Both camps perceived immigrants as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that one is willing to admit to the immigrants.
Francois Hollande confines himself in his programme to banalities, which point out that development in partnership allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the elections, but it is economically costly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present to us in a recent work summarising the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Limiting immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to replace the local workers, especially the less skilled ones, by putting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than domestic wage-earners, since they are mainly engaged in occupations in sectors which are unencumbered in terms of employment.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that are not attractive to local wage earners, the more skilled among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where education is not aligned with labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, this complementarity also brings about a positive effect of immigration migration on wages and the domestic labour market.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants would result in an inclusive, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas introduced by immigrants and economic growth is beneficial (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, on average around 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that a person immigrating to Germany at the age of 30 will, on average, contribute a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over his lifetime.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring about the missing intersections "with the teeth".
However, these said teeth, which were supposed to deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now it remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had let the entire 20th century pass over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some had believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy triumph over its enemies once and for all.
One knows since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a characteristic of the mental attitude.
The general right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can become just as well an "oppression instrument", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot expressed it at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, education, economic and social community spirit, jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is just as serious and first and foremost a political and democratic crisis.
The change of attitude of the Greek True-False referendum would have had a double enlightening character in this respect: one that of the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also that of the disturbing feeling of their impossibility, of their inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to press for the success of the national referendum, which has been organised according to needs and in wrong order.
A free pass for the European sovereign or a blindfolded leap into the void of nationalistic withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, out of full law, settled and steady, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - we do not know where to end the list any more - because there is only one crisis, and it prevails in Europe.
It is all Europe that is bowing to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated at international level.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - and it is all Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every one of the nations attached to it.
The urgency is to give the leadership of the European project back to the people's sovereignty.
For it is all about whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and create a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis is a condition for decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legality without surely leading us to ruin.
After a long time of fighting this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone today is pushing European economic governance to do so.
Agreed.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it proposes to the citizens - would be a new folly and a further dead end.
We must embark on a new stage in European integration.
In order to create the republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not suffice here.
This teaching remains valid.
We must be an economically more integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" smart cards become common goods
The World Chip Card Fair opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 was supposed to end with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is contactless technology, which allows payments on public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless smart cards worldwide were to be sold this year!
Their market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment, after having been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
Consumer markets, however, are making steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move at a higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out bank cards equipped with contactless chips to their customers in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first stage on the way to the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
To date, a tiny percentage of devices have been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
"You're in delay."
"But they should at least experience a real upward trend next year."
"In 2012, we expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also declared yesterday that it was preparing for the launch of an offer that would allow its customers contactless payment by mobile phone.
Terrorist Front understands itself, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-awaited relationship between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seems to have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now acquired "certainty".
"The way in which both organizations operate and the relations between the secret services indicate clear cooperation," he said without going into any further detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January revealed interfaces.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped by supporters of the Aqmi in a restaurant in Niamey, are said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their abductors during an operation carried out by the French Special Forces.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble at the scene of the operation.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the telephone calls led to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but there is no doubt that we need to wait for clearer evidence before we can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem".
"It's possible, though."
"It has been known for years that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from outside and that this is becoming increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo mitigates.
In recent months, these "support services" have become increasingly visible in their course, as have the speeches and operational modes of Boko Harem, which now point to the involvement of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives bearing the same signature as those used by Aqmi.
The international community to begin with Washington has since then put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed long regarded the group as a community of Illuminati, which does not need to be given special attention.
Fast success
Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri near a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a disgrace" - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this destitute region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict observance of the Sharia, while the activists attached to it are fighting against the godless central government.
The activists first target churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram were particularly active in their intensified attacks against the Commissioners.
However, Abuja's reaction is as usual indifferent.
The army surrounds the city. 800 people are killed.
The imprisoned Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming increasingly radical and leaving its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to an assassination in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was blamed for a suicide attack that took place in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations became the primary international target.
Since then, the formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has troubled all security experts.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Harem and showed himself ready to "communicate all the indications".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and assistance to Israel.
Can a crisis-stricken America lead a complex world with simple, not to say simple, ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates like this, the voters could almost get that impression.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their colleagues have repeatedly announced their thundering statements and statements regarding foreign policy, a traditional republican focus.
Slogans about China, Iran, and Israel aid fall – often in no way underpinned.
Mitt Romney, who was the highest on the agenda for the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and accuse them of "currency manipulation" - a leading issue in an America that is highly irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
Dumbly run, if this is to imply the start of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost cut off the air in terms of his emotionally flattering behaviour.
He had called for a tangible but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman is not answered because he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also commended military blows against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear programme were to fail.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"When Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
In addition, he promised Israel increased military assistance and accused Obama of remaining guilty of obligations to this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second-highest-placed candidate, in turn shows a shameful lack of record.
Recently, he called for the Chinese military threat to be countered, as Beijing "attempts to develop a nuclear power" - and in doing so seemed to ignore the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and demands military blows against Iran, says he is ready to take the American army into service in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama’s 2009 ban on resorting to torture against suspected terrorists was also endorsed by Cain, Perry and the candidacy of Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an extra-political heavyweight.
In opposition to the current presidential opponents, Reagan also had simple ideas and despite all this won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama was himself an amateur and had to pour water into his wine, as far as anti-terrorism was concerned.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
This hostility, however, is not quite so casual.
The population rather appreciates the positive balance of National Security under Obama, which Bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama is more likely to surprise by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to bring its leadership back to life.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with glory and glory.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under sea level, last Tuesday on the Baltic Sea coast under orchestral sound and gourmet buffet.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte symbolically turned the valve control, which transports the Russian gas to the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline is expected to deliver 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year to Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1,224 km in length that connects the Saint Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of French total consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already let the eventuality of building a third line sound on your own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous building looks like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will enable direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: it is now more difficult for them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was not afraid to compare the Nord-Stream pipeline with a "new German-Andean pact" linked to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically very sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
This, however, is at the expense of a reduction in European energy, as the project has made a break between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to achieve its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which have strong gas consumption and whose gas reserves are running out.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically," François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out the extent to which the large gas contracts are important from the political and economic side.
All this explains the broad smile of the numerous Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding the gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line is made of steel with concrete sheathing, which is intended to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at about 200 m depth.
During their construction, minefields dating from World War II had to be avoided.
"About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect fauna and flora.
The line is a long line of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted by anything over the entire length: neither by valves, nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have refrained from doing so, as the Swedes had little desire to see a Russian state company permanently settling at the level of their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we close the gas passage in less than one minute," Jens Müller specified.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is not considered likely by the designers, since the welds were estimated to be resistant to one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot controlled for external observation purposes from a seagoing ship and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, with a diameter of one metre, is inserted into the inside of the pipe and moved by the gas pressure.
After three complete days of movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on possible deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to function for fifty years without even having to undergo the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is easily guaranteed by pressure.
This amounts to 200 bar at the entrance point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have combined their forces to realize this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated (each 15.5%), as are the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (each 9%).
These five companies have formed a corporate group called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company under a renewable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the volume of gas transported will be," Jens Müller explained.
The financing of gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
Total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are prepared to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas pipeline is exposed on a sandy, pine-wooded coastline near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas outlet gate.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other parameters of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Launched by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, by candlelight with the hours spent writing.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognisable, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the eggshell sides, as over time aged.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as it is known today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's specialist consultant at the time, is commissioned with the market launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old production technique called Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton rack, which is used, for example, for upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was in great demand among writers and travellers.
"Moleskine revived an old and almost forgotten object, which until the 20th century was regarded as an icon of avant-garde artists," explains Maria Sebregondi, now a brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established itself with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook inspires businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early days, now employs over 100 people and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in the city centres and is committed to asserting its identity.
"We have followed the zeitgeist and its new writing needs, which exist despite the upswing of e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine company: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, at the Locarno Film Festival, the company also launched a cover with leopard patterns.
Moleskine profited from its success and cultural zeitgeist and managed to diversify its products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer covers... The brand has the entire range of articles.
A success that brings envy to the plan: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought up by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of the Moleskine company.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th week of work for the disabled".
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice the average: 19% against 9% unemployment of the total population.
Disheartening?
"No, according to Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, which organizes the "Week of Work for the Disabled".
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still a great deal to be done."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for disabled unemployed people before they get a job.
It is more common for older people: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them have no Abitur and only 10,000 disabled people are among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the disabled, compared with 38% of the total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter the labour market and make it "the core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
Remains the unspoken, the attitudes that are certainly but slowly evolving.
A study carried out in April by the Association IMS-Entreprendre for the journal La Cité stated that the managers surveyed had "a weak level of knowledge regarding disabled people", which was "overrepresented" by "persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually deprived persons".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was laid down in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, dating from 2008, indicate a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, General Director of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that are not respecting this law.
Proof: The number of "paying" establishments has decreased, as has the sum of the paid-up amounts between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which provides for increases in contributions, put a lot of pressure on companies," Pierre Blanc said.
"But this improvement also expresses a real insight, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of establishments between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, while enterprises with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a lucky thing"
Even before they stood up to the "Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45 clock), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed their pleasure, which brought them the friendly game.
It would be too far-reaching to claim that there had been a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the audience podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have liked to make peace.
Five months after the spirited gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," says Liller, a native of Liller.
As for the contrast between his portrayal in club and national team, "It's a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille I am all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought in Friday night against Romania regarding the match against France, to finally "shin"".
However, without neglecting the note of "pleasure".
He has been cheering on the French national team since the age of seven, and led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This inevitably contributes to strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter even more.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
"We just ran into each other."
"To play against them is great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, made a good-natured sound of "Stolz".
"The pride to play a gala match."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in his capacity as "neighbor" - that France"has again become a team of very high level", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a hell of a good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the aircraft with the Blues (the French national team) ... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
"We're planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will notice this in the upcoming games." The game against France involved.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism to the return match against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
Both teams lacked the objectivity of the game.
"At the end of this 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, that means, in fact, only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play and to dump an opponent, namely Bosnia.
In view of the play-out (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to put on the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk, as we have not scored an away goal."
At home, however, in their brightly radiating Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will be able to beat themselves in front of an audience that is likely to be just as hot as the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very tight", said the optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but are completely convinced that we can win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be part of the 2012 European Championship", but the successor of Carlos Queiroz relatived.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
A tie can already be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk as we have not scored an away goal," Bento regrets.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese would want to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to "allow them no time to think."
A good idea, provided it is put into practice this time.
