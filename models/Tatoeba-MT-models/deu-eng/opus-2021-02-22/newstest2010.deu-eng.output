Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
American President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma and the medal and a check of 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House will arrive tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the Northwegian metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he pays a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organisations.
The presidential couple then planned a meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its climax with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prestigious prize.
He received the award as the fourth US president, but only as the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when he takes over the price.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he will accept the prize as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
A few days ago, he reinforced the war effort by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forgets to emphasize.
At the ceremony Obama also received the Gol Medal, the Diploma and the cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The program of events will then include a banquet with the President and his wife, at which, in addition to Norway's King and Queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very reserved from the beginning to the price.
For example, he said that he felt that he did not quite deserve the price.
He also repeated several times that the price is not only for him, but for all those who aspire to the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this was "a request to act" for him.
Nature conservationist accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the citizens' association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of extortion.
In several cases he filed appeals against some construction proceedings last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from the investors in his favor, said the Leitmeritz police spokesman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz-Naturschutzgemeinschaft is Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he is in prison and he is facing a prison term of up to three years.
The sorting garbage containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague people can sort the beverage packaging, in the southern Moravian villages you can find the sorting containers at every step.
What about Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage cans.
I do not want to say that waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Councillors do not care enough about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is located in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all by the number of garbage cans for such waste.
Have you ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket, for example?
That's art, and above all, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far by chance is Moravian Square opposite the hit goose.
Mr Onderka should not be annoyed by his colleagues, but that seems to me far too little.
Apart from the fact that the separation of waste is also in other parts no honey slick.
Whole rows of my friends would rather not sort the garbage.
Out of laziness.
Because it's too far for them to get to the garbage cans.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles after the celebration.
But on Konicova Street, I didn't see any tins of paint in sight.
Fortunately, I got to the right place when driving a tram.
The garbage almost went over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us all over the Republic, rather than buying a few more bins and offering sorting more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The Paroubek budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government's view, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, sickness benefits and construction savings.
Nor for the sovereign debt interest or for the international court disputes.
This causes even more problems to those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the salary increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money for the sensitive expenses, old-age pensions or for the sickness allowance. "This is just a postponement of the problems in the future, mining," says Janota.
The loans pay higher and higher interest rates, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, where to get, the treasury is empty.
If social benefits or costs for the state enterprise are not reduced, the tax should be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party has now given more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for their children.
In order to get the pensions or the sickness benefit, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people need not be afraid, they get this money.
But at the price that the state is still more indebted - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state treasury, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will increase more and more rapidly, along with costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money for the compensation, then it will no longer be enough to increase the VAT only slightly or to reduce the maternity allowance, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
As a result of the transfer of money in favour of some electoral groups, another five billion will be missing next year for the development of motorways and railways.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be reprojected and possibly discounted.
Mostly received, which is also not free.
This means delay or cessation of thirty large buildings, and the creation of European money is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it resolves the drain of money Salomonically - it attacks the CEZ stock dividends, where the state owns the majority, and from these the money is then distributed into the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never safe and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, the budget of CEZ amounted to 18 billion.
Every year, the dividends are paid for environmental damage, the pension account is filled up and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit to the Nieveau of 5.7 percent GDP, according to the rules of the EU.
But this does not end the carnival of the upheavals.
Nearly three billion fell the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crime or for expenses for court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can cope without this money is not certain.
It's pure gambling.
If we lose an international legal dispute, we'll have to pay for it anyway, Janota explains.
The minister must then save money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing for the already begun two billion project "State Treasury", which is intended to enable on-line monitoring for what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, warned Janota.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
For the future, Americans expect a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single key.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to press just one button, and from Windows Mobile will change within seconds Android.
This is precisely what the American company VMware wants to present, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for computers.
We enable you to run two user profiles on your mobile phone at the same time.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware pointed out in an interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
The market will come in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory running parallel to the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working together with the European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and the customer is expected to receive the devices within 2012.
Snow shortage on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Scneeless slopes are not only a concern for the Krkonoše residents.
The lack of snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore in Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are visited frequently.
People go through the offers, find out the prices, but now they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if in our opinion this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
Who wants the New Year's Eve stay in the Spindle Mill exactly according to his ideas, should no longer hesitate with the order.
Those who prefer saving and in which the quality of the stay comes only in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindlermühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for New Year's Day.
I think they will try to sell them for a while, but then they too will have to give in and go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, appreciated Jandura.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not sold out yet.
In our offer about half of the places is still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert, mentioned.
The Vrchlabi tourist office can also offer New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains, but there are less free places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely and a little better than last year, the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou manage to occupy.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas, we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also occupied by the central parking lot in Janske Lazne by 80 percent for the New Year's Eve stays.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne at Christmas.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by January, for which we are already about 60 percent occupied.
February is a bit weaker by now, but at the moment when the snow comes, interest in stays in the Giant Mountains certainly increases, the director of Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, mentioned.
The Krkonoše hotel owners are now waiting for a larger snow shearing.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, a warming will come again, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
It is almost strange with which student eagerness Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghanistan question, which he himself considered to be the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it off three years ago via the copy paper from the Bush Iraq scenario.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward Way" without fidgeting.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea of sending out fresh contingents of troops in Iraq, plagued by the civil war, as "irresponsible and in its consequences a carastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only possible and very successful one, so far, that the news about Iraq no longer speaks at all.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, for objectively he left his successor with a much more appreciative starting point than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
He was again asked by the military to increase the contingent of troops, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite his subordination habits, strongly criticized the timid shooters in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but didn't come up with a better idea and so he cheated on the general wenist for 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the pledge for another 5,000, even though he originally expected at least 10,000.
His plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this process within three years is highly problematic in the whole Obama strategy. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the fratricidal war of recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by contraindication - nobody can be relied on and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if formally established correctly, remain only bogus buildings, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the ambiguity of the conditions that complicate Pakistan and Iran's influence even further.
The building of a "active state" which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama’s strategy puzzled by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and now it is on the brink of the explosion.
Believe in the fact that the little soldiers who have broken into the war cry about the "early homecoming" create a miracle here, can only a really romantic soul, which cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will accept this as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is running out.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu Kush foothills.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the United States will face a very serious question as to whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question has to be answered during the period when America is moving to the victory withdrawal from Afghanistan after Obama.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic change in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that three more years remain until the presidential election, and thus there is still enough time for him to resort to another strategy that would turn out to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive cash bonuses
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive any bonus bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which reacts to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of money, but they can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from managers in the event of excessive risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of the efforts to combine Wall Street's premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is aware of the wider direction in which it has to go, said the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs set itself the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
According to the Reuters agency, the total amount of premium bonuses over the course of this year will probably exceed 20 billion dollars even in spite of the measure announced today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries since the start of the financial crisis.
On Wednesday, Britain reported that it intended to impose a single tax of 50 percent on bankers’ bonuses exceeding £25,000.
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all disciplines, except physics.
Today in Stockholm, five record women from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf took over this year's Nobel Prizes in the specialist categories and for literature.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, was among them.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of Chromosons.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for the clarification of the ribosome structure and function.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman was awarded a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, have won this prize for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, Nobel Medal and certificate of purchase of the money prize.
It is worth ten million Swedish kroner in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the money prize will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he recognized the controversies of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his journey, and also at the head of the country that is waging two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the struggle for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives the Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, on Friday morning, who is thinking about his whereabouts in the government because he disagrees with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form that was approved by the Parliament on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the remaining Janota in the cabinet will be the themes of the Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticises the budget.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also further deepens the crisis in public finances.
The President's Spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, on Monday about his further stay in office.
According to the Budget Act, which is now being signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
In Parliament, however, the left-wing party proposals on money circulation were voted on Wednesday and the money for the state officials' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers were increased.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democrats that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The left party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and right-wing party, on the other hand, have therefore developed a sharp domestic political dispute, for which the question mark arises about the further work of the Fischer official cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, is practically liquidating the package of austerity measures that were enforced by the fishermen's government in the autumn, and that, in their understanding, is intended to put an end to public debt.
Klaus, who can but does not have to sign the bill on the state budget, said today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected the "serious problem", which is "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a wider consensus among political parties.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolanek stated that the budget was horrifying and that the government should weigh its further existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Necas told the CTK that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, obviously no longer works.
Premier Fischer described similar words in the editorial office as "strong pronouncements".
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was horrifying, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows the world much of the country, of its struggle and victories despite some criticisms that the leading role was cast by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, race and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, presents in his life story the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by ninety-one-year-old Mandela to present him in the Eastwood movie.
Matt Damon plays another meaningful role.
I told him, "If I play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby", was already the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which he finally became a slave owner, a fictional US president, and also God in "Evan Allmighty", but rarely someone who is still alive and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active work in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was freed in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how he spoke
The film portrays a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to unite the country. Mandela knows that his people still remain racially and economically divided, even after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to agree on the Rugby players, who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team will rise to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked on it for several years to bring the Mandela story to the movie screen.
He had no other purpose than to play this role in order to bring it closer to reality as closely as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it is transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
It's important to me to have become another person.
Matt Damon portrays in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team in which the white players have dominated.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell that it opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his evaluation in the following words: "That was a very good story, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret over Norway dissolved: Russians tested a rocket
About Norway a special light effect of unknown origin could be observed.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was not successful again and the rocket called the "Bulava", which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality as well as the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on the ground during the rocket test also had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has mostly not been started at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers they already write about "Bulava" as about a "rocket that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly, but lights up
This already 13th attempt, went normal at the beginning.
Technical damage to the rocket occurred only at the end of the flight.
Probably the engine exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time "Bulava" started from the atomic submarine Dmitry Donsky, which sailed under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the launch of the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over northern routes was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, since the first moment, the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian rocket.
This time, the generality has kept its guard against it and claims that it is not possible to speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was made without errors, the administration of the Ministry of Defence considers only six out of thirteen unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore satisfies the generality with optimism and so it is further claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defensive player Vjacislav Fetisov presents himself again at 51 years in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder helps his team CSKA Moscow in need, and probably already in the Friday duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas got hurt, we urgently need another defensive player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other fellow players, listed Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary striker Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, winning 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
He won two Olympic gold medals, seven World Championship titles in the Soviet Union's dress and also won the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also scored in the NHL, where he twice topped the Stanley Cup in the Detroit Dressup.
He has been a member of the ice hockey star room since 2001.
Hyundai gave in to the unions. All overtime will be cancelled
The management of the Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai agreed with the union to cancel all overtime.
Because of often ordered overtime, the union announced its readiness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman for the Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not abandon our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two work shifts would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The employees also receive this in retrospect for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime supplement or they can take a replacement holiday on 28 December and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek explained.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the fare and lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and burning point with regard to demands and complaints of trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk pointed out.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work 2 overtime hours almost every day after the eight-hour shift.
From the signing of the agreement, the unions' willingness to strike will be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the Automobilfabrik and the trade unionists will take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they will be ready to cancel the strike.
The situation in the automobile factory worsened last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of continuous overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
On the other hand, the management held that the employees had to make the overtime to comply with the automotive supply requirement.
The unionists also demanded in their Monday strike readiness proclamation that the employees who had interrupted the production last Wednesday are not subject to any sanctions.
In the area of overtime, the unions demand that overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, they are calling for the payment of 5000 kroner this year.
The Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Serial production started in the company in November last year.
By this September approximately 80,000 vehicles were produced here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in ́stamped ́ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works in viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not have the same effect on common virus variants as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot yet be cured.
However, the patient can prolong his life and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of viral reproduction also results in the development of resistance viruses, against which no drugs are effective anymore.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, the VSCHT (Chemisch-technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances referred to as metalocarborans act on the protein that is responsible for the reproduction of the HIV virus.
The metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus proliferation in a different way than any medicine used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new ́improved ́ compounds, which were prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-faceted cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms, coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Steadfast and Persistent Virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus split caused by HIV protease, no mature virus particles would emerge.
If we turn off the HIV protease, we also eliminate the proliferation of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The impact of this range of substances against HIV protease was tested in the test tube, including their resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as with the clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants, against which the used drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formations, makes metalocarboranes interesting compounds for further research into the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fighting over budget. ODS went off to Fischer, who resists
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "grey" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its further existence.
The Prime Minister called the statement of the ODS "strong pronouncements".
It's supposed to take time for the analysis.
Deputy Chairman of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament when it comes to fighting the rising deficit, or whether he intends to remain in office through the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, as Necas pointed out.
Parliament adopted the 2010 budget on Wednesday, but with proposals for amendments to the Left Party on more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants’ salaries, for maintaining social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democrats that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic was to operate with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, so it has complied with the government's wish, because the revised budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisional. Frase not clear
Disappointment and futility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, talked about his disappointment and a sense of futility, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign if the amendments were adopted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota has registered with the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
In doing so, he indicated that he was considering continuing to remain in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the budget negotiation.
According to Necas, the nominees of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who had enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government to what extent Fischer is in favour of the further struggle with the budget deficit.
The Prime Minister should also state clearly that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those concerning sickness benefits and pensions or the amendment to the Civil Service Act.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is up to the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek pointed out in a text from the USA.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in a deputy position who are committed to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides not to fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he should rely on the left majority that is currently in Parliament".
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that is the case, then I will deal with it, said the Minister of Defence Martin Bartak, nominated by the citizens' democrats, to the journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon to attend the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister explicitly asked the members of the citizens' democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, so he then responded to the question whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party leader in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
Even when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the next few months it would be mainly about bolshevization of Parliament and destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will travel for approximately the same fare.
The Czech Railway will end or restrict some less busy express and local trains from 13 December, while other services will be strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most tariffs, including base and customer fares, are not changed.
Several connections to the capital are available, for example, to the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, and the railway uses Pendolino trains for this route.
The fast train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also run on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz) is planning the largest reduction, a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
There are also two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and a few days a week the operation of some high-speed trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to change trains in Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, which can be opened thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Central Station.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run at a time interval of two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers have not been able to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's regional railway bill: increase of 200 million
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, and the railway will receive four billion kroner in the next year to cover the so-called loss of liquidity, just like this year. The local trains will supply the districts, paying a total of eight billion kroner next year, with the state shooting three billion kroner.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech kroner more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the high-speed trains, the railway has newly concluded a ten-year contract, until now the contract has only been concluded for one year.
The railways praise the system, perhaps because of this they have not resorted to price increases for the vast majority of tickets.
Changes can only be made with one-day CD Net and with cheap eLiska Internet tickets.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven rod, until now it was uniform for travel between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine millitants arrest more than 50 people and the children were released.
Millitante today kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
This was mentioned by the AFP agency, which initially informed only 65 people who had been kidnapped.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millitants allegedly used the hostages as living shields to escape the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to release the rest of the hostage.
According to the agency AFP, the millitants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), this is the weapons faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the law of standing was imposed on the recent massacre of 57 people.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which coincided with the election to the governorship, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Filipino province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
The island of Mindanao is also home to Muslim separatists.
But those who resumed the peace negotiations with the Filipino government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will be shown in the American cinemas "Invictus: the Unbeaten", which includes part of the life story of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly selected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African champion in rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
With the cinema launch of the film, reactions from critics as well as the public are also loud.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize together with de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it comes to the cinemas at a time when, on the one hand, South Africa culminates in preparations for the World Cup, but at the same time the media shakes the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are consistently positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the leading roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, in his own words, is still proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I can - as they say - receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandela's personality and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects everyone, he added.
Dressed by the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book template of the British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people portrays the South African defender of human rights in his first presidential term.
In the course of the film Morgan Freeman tries to bring together two racial groups and, since year and day, mutually demarcated populations and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the World Cup field in his role in the South African National Rugbydress, which South Africa won at that time.
For entering the lawn in dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations fourteen years ago, predominantly from the white audience and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may be able to unite people into one people, led rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only black in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa is improving will only become apparent.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, as revealed by the rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain, for example in a recent interview with LN.
The championship will start on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million kroner
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the district fire brigade Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened in the fire.
Originally the fire department wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishing agents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer inner short circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the safety operation of the management system according to the company spokesperson, Pavla Mandova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will only be quantifiable after the fire.
According to Mandova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
For over 10 years nothing similar has happened in the company Ceps, mistakes of this kind are rare, they added.
According to the spokesperson of CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the power supply was not interrupted, the fire of the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as the sole operator of the line system, the electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switchgears with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred to distribution system and line line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura charges three heads of the CSSD for defamation.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is today indicting three social-democratic leaders for slander.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint is related to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, but we have submitted the offer only about the extent as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech Railways, because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways that were completed last week.
We have no choice but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the Student Agency Society, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he argued that he had evidence from all districts that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the charge to be a continuation of Jancura's medial show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company and for his own person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that in this matter too it will become clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses lying and untrue arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million kroner in advertising, which will point to the adverse step taken by the districts.
He told the radio journal that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and continue it after New Year.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed on regional rail services with the Czech Railways and did not tender for the contract at a cost of 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such behaviour is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, he was already threatened by a member of the CSSD because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts.
The only threat was if we didn't do without it, that we could also lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, said today Jancura to the radio journal.
Vaccination against pneumococci free and voluntary
Imfung against pneumococci changes the usual from January.
It is said to be the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But even now voices have been voiced that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
culminating the preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci.
The medical institute already sets the maximum prices of the vaccines that health insurance companies have to pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated for free against pneumococci born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a dose of vaccine.
Those who have already started vaccination in the past year or earlier must also pay for further repeated vaccination themselves.
The first dose should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci.
The parents paid 1600 kroner and more for one dose.
Vaccination of the youngest children requires four doses.
On the whole, the experts estimate that health insurance spends 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year on the doses.
However, they save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
Until now, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all area vaccinations of the children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections cause up to 28 children up to 10 years of age to die in hospitals every year.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococci was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January this is to be paid by the insurance companies and voluntary.
For example, Rudolf Kalovsky, head of the Nahlas Association of Citizens, mentioned that the mandatory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we had voluntary vaccination.
That's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to achieve at least that.
I believe that this is the way we have to go now, led Kalovsky.
The Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment we are not considering this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, the doctors claim.
The chairman of the association of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabronochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think about reducing the number of revaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one," says Cabronochova, however.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococci from next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in that this is the first area vaccination paid by the health insurance companies and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, thus saving them for further treatment, Cabrnochova explains.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is a concern of the practical pediatricians, which concerns the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors should receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
However, some MEPs feared that insurance companies would be able to "exploit the money from health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for the insurance companies to pay them.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabronochova.
US artist son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal 20 million dollars worth of paintings from his father's museum.
According to Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught in his vehicle with trailers while loading 90 paintings.
They say Frank Frazetta junior and another man used an excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures like Conan der Barbar and Tarzan.
According to the Associated Press news agency, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior might have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum by all means to bring all the paintings into a camp."
The agency announced that Frank Frazetta Senior denied any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending freezes announced in the pre-budget report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling had "spent" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing the decisions out until after the election.
The Chancellor also came under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social security and a 1 percent cap on public wage settlements for 2011.
Social security
Trade unions have protested that low-wage earners are being punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned of impending "problems".
The increase in social security - to about £3 billion a year - has upset the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than 20,000 pounds sterling a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE PREVIOUS ETALY REPORT
Increase in social security by a further 0.5 % from April 2011
This year the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
1 percent increase in corporation tax for small enterprises rejected
Tax rebates for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase of public pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be £90 per year poorer and someone with £40,000 per year will be £190 poorer, while a person with £10,000 per year income will be £110 richer.
Ministers said their deficit halving target for 2013 meant "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional tax burden would be on the 5% of top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax increases and spending freezes would be "a drop in the ocean" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are large figures. They will bring us the deficit halving and this is also absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party’s predictions of future economic growth – which affects the size of new debt and the speed of deficit ablation – were questioned after the Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - much more than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April – while debt would be £3 billion higher than previously forecast.
"Missed opportunity"
Conservatives who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of the Labour "debt crisis" said that the planned indebtedness of £789 billion over the next six years would be unsustainable.
They added that ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to repay this and "cynical" shy away from difficult decisions until after the election – which must take place by June 2010 at the latest.
"They didn't say anything about what they're going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their chance to do so, and they let them pass by."
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police are protected from future cuts, unlike the Conservative proposals, which see deficit capping coming faster and sooner.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by the tax increases and spending freezes is not used to cover next year's expenditure, to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand".
The BBC political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements – such as the above inflation adjustment for some disability pensions next April – the Chancellor of the Exchequer would suspend the charge of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra help when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler Etat"
Although ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only come into effect in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Investigations said that the figures of the Chancellor of the Exchequer would mean strong reductions in many areas, possibly in the future also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It just shifts the pain to later," said his director Robert Chote.
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, accountant at the auditing firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow preliminary budget report, and the markets see it."
FBI Investigates US Citizens Arrests in Pakistan
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Punjab province, the American Embassy in Pakistan informed the BBC.
The FBI said they're investigating if these are the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Department of State said they're also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be Pakistani, one is Egyptian, and the other has Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are accused of and under what circumstances they are being held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed about the arrests and was in touch with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if it's actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington announced that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had previously been interested in the house and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
The news agency Reuters reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US "must work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty Condemns "Missions" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, the human rights situation in Iran is still as bad as it has been in the past 20 years.
The report details "abuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the biggest street protests since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest leader, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election results.
"They often slapped me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in the neck, on my head... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty shared.
Beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in the prison in August and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape charges, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained in a container in a detention centre in Kahrizak with 75 others for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's reactions to it, but so Amnesty, the mandates and power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people were arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slope has been set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to transform a landmark in Bristol into a competitive runway.
The ski slope of this parking event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short ski jump at the beginning of a 100 meter long slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It's a great view with all the lights of the city glistening below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best tricks or tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted in favour of a construction ban for minarets and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated — and integrated — into one of the most declaredly secularized societies in Europe.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French Don't Love Headscarves" (2006), an elegant and highly argued study of an issue that divided and occupied the country for a decade and a half and whose effects can still be perceived today.
Bowen's latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it, "Islamic freedom".
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or town hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, that make up daily life, quite unlike the political dramas that occupy the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They do not have all the arguments on their side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Bowen questioned are mostly divided with their Salafi counterparts – advocates of purist Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia – which nowadays show a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) feel truly committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn had to make their historical compromise with secular Republicanism.
He is more likely to recognize a "increase of the value screws" than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The most desolate view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes it melts with alarming speed and takes life with it that nowhere else can survive.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have recently entered open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, paints a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear, in "On Thin Ice".
Experienced in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proved themselves in hunting the polar bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign to the sea, who only fought with the rifle butt of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have one millionth of the life span of a wild animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore became all green from the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and snowmobile-propelled Inuit use powerful assault rifles to hunt down their prey.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of Arctic science and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
However, this is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century for the first time revealed the whirling of the pack ice.
Undersea boats in the Cold War the shifting ridges during the descent.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale application of measuring probes on icebergs, but much is still achieved by intrepid people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the strange, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by the saltwater channel compressed during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic miracles in the ice, all are threatened when the summer ice once passes, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... could be the us"
Marine infantrymen were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths in Arlington
The Chief Private De'Angello Robinson travelled by bus for seven hours to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other naval infantrymen who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they have followed.
In a few months, from wherever we are brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd wish someone would do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to place wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip every year, stop in different cities along the way to perform events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other countries.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the tombs at the Arlington Cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, at graves at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at the Memorial to United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this is her way of giving back to those who made sacrifices.
She said that this is a small contribution on how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the vast lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War as a goal, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held hands while they carried the fresh pine branches to the greying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends held together in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others bent down to small black-and-white maps, which had been put into the damp mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son's grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio to visit the burial site of Marine Infranterie sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been around for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
US government contractor arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the State Department on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the US International Development Authority and the World Bank.
Consular officials from the U.S. representation of interests in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although according to Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the charge of "hazard".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro brother's communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy places great value on the fact that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought after products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year; they are used primarily for sending text messages, as a 15-minute telephone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet usage on the island is extremely restricted.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesperson for the U.S. interest representation in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivarco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, who recently published a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, Same Cuba", an allusion to the appointment of Raul Castro as leader of the country, replacing the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often arrested, sentenced and detained within one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, especially at the time when both countries are moving towards one another for more willingness to dialogue.
Pakistani government officials uncover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers and said that they hoped this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said that they had been looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had tracked them down because one of them had made positive comments on terrorist attacks on the YouTube Internet video page.
After their arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, which is home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence, who was briefed on the matter, said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the Al-Qaeda leaders that the men were not part of a CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest that have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and kept trying to get the right recommendations to get access to the Al Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani prison authorities.
The case of the five men - who continue to be in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and possibly even more importantly in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has made it a matter of utmost urgency to place human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as porters who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are subjected to a special test by A Qaeda, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be tremendously attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to whom they allow access, because the U.S. intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to get someone into these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators call for climate "action" in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded bolder action on climate protection from the negotiators in the city's Bella Congress Centre.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates were more likely to run out of about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosive devices near some government buildings in the city centre.
One day, when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists walked through the city with banners saying in English "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish saying "The Earth says "Enough".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that her travels to Peru, her mother's country of birth, made her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country has to deal with due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That is part of the motivation why I decided to take part in the great demonstration - to pass the floor and appeal to the world leaders to reach a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothes lit several explosive devices near the main channel in Copenhagen, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flares, but then followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of TV screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest apparently did not reach the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of at all."
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it depends on the individual's perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disturb the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent breed gap
The diplomas of mathematics were last week welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the country's high-performance schools, the evidence shows that the fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) figures is the persistent gap between African American and white students, both at local and national level.
The average score of the white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) in the last two years, but that of their African-American peers rose by only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African-American eighth-graders basically remained the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap separating white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was captured in this district was 60 points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have achieved has increased over this period of time, the difference has hardly decreased with now 58 points.
Some district educators expressed concern last week that the results celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were largely driven by white students who are already powerful children anyway.
This suggests that we have raised the overall ranking by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates educational equality in Washington D.C.
I am not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points, said Democratic Washington City Councillor Kwame R. Brown, who has a fourth grade daughter in Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the exam scores is that the city's middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What frightens me, however, is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy we need to use for our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-performance students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and middle school, who have not mastered basic reading skills at the beginning of their school career and who are significantly behind their peers of the same age.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games and lifelike experiences from kindergarten to sixth grade, was brought to Washington under former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to ensure that the best measures are taken by students who are below grades, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the extra money and resources for the low-performance schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who is investigating urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could have political repercussions on this important item on the agenda.
The weak point is, of course, as with other city school inspectors, that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighbourhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements in closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
One must increase the school year to approximately 200 days in order to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year on 185 days a year, which he regarded as "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than the future
The coach reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, steps out and blinks a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents hardly finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was recovered in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eighth graders of the group who explore Gettysburg, where tuition costs 38,690 dollars a year, was more of an awe-inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I will be here soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for science.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when the low professor-to-student ratio of the school was reported to her.
The college in Pennsylvania was the seventh one the kids visited on their three-day tour and now they have taken up the intended message completely: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to get into the middle class.
In reality, one in five of these "second generation" of Hispanic Americans completes college – which is a remarkable achievement as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without graduating from high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who study powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for school and a drive to success inherent in them.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counselling programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like her to get to college, especially if these efforts persist over a long period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied Hispanic American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from preschool to high school.
The federal program that Graciela's college tour funded is a useful example.
It's known as GEAR UP - Turning up a gear - and providing more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch college prep programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue running until they've graduated high school.
According to the US Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom went to college.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to persuade major oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions closed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts signed by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has made a shortcoming.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil multinationals in opening up the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war, and instead of US companies, Asians and Europeans are giving way, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which were underlined by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability caused by the withdrawal of the US military, have probably prevented American oil companies from doing so, analysts said, to engage more strongly in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
US companies have been disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to have contracts with the Department.
Larger US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have had close relations with the Iraqi Department of Oil and have had technical advice in recent years, have run out.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman for the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the greats of the global economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can compete with its competitors and will fulfil its obligations to Iraq.
Companies pre-selected for bid submission submitted bids, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of Al Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan
In an obvious U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top Al Qaeda planner is said to have been killed this week, reported representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism campaign on Friday.
This, if confirmed, would be the second fatal attack on a high-ranking terrorist organization this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region, were killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the rockets were fired by a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a government representative of a Pakistani civilian intelligence agency from Miran Shah said by telephone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the site and quickly took everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US counter-terrorism movement cited indeterminate evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as the leading Al Qaeda military planner who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous and pointed to the delicate nature of US airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
If one assumes its central role as given, this also included the planning of attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and implemented them in operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali had quickly ascended to the Al Qaeda hierarchy and had the best connections to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second official, but this does not in any way reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al-Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September when Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed in a similar attack.
The rate of attacks by CIA drones has decreased from an average of six operations per month to two, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website run by a non-profit organization.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The leading UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from office in March, ending a stormy term of office clouded by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
Eide's departure occurred when the Obama administration decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concern that the US military withdrawal timetable, which is scheduled to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their armed forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces, sending the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The military increase must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign, but only fulfilled an agreement made in March 2008 with his family to remain in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to the UN
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon now forward so that he has time to provide for a replacement.
What I said was that he'd better start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I got here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has started to search for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eids rejected all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - who was fired - "have undoubtedly harmed the mission because there has already been a great deal of scepticism about international interference in the election."
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries to donate to the Afghan mission, saying that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at restricting his forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN recruitment arrangements have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I could only hire one person.
This is disastrous and must not go on like this.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in talks on his nuclear plans.
During a seven-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of approximately 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq and played down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good choices, he said in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that lie on my soul is, if we have learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, the war's own unpredictability."
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected by nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer tremendously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined the European leaders in warning that Iran will have to face "credible" consequences if it does not comply with the demands of the UN Security Council and its Nuclear Surveillance Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology is to be gained only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume talks to restrict its nuclear programme and would forego a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since that time -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
Gates said that Iran simply let the international community stand by in terms of some of the proposals that it had already agreed to in early October, frankly bringing together the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way that they never did in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran.
President Obama has set the 31 Dec as the deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "pressive sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian delegation to the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday "fundamental and unfundamental claims" by some Security Council members on Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are ready to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq for meetings with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, especially in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent delays in US plans to reduce US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel Kurdish concern about the impending withdrawal of troops. US representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A Change of Course in Ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters giving them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "One baby more means one grave more."
They learned these lessons so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change the course and encourage young couples to have more than one child, due to the low birth rate and the ageing population this summer, their answer was immediate and definitive: "No way."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a personnel manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously fat, spoiled single children, who are affectionately called "little emperors", a population crisis in the country is looming.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN
Department of Population Issues, while the number of population groups aged 60 and over is expected to increase from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people accounted for almost 22 percent of reported residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples of childbearing age have to have babies to "help reduce the ratio of ageing populations and alleviate the labour shortage of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A Gradual Relaxation
Established in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial order introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Married couples who violate this policy have to face enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese state representatives have attributed it to this policy that the critical use of natural land resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of politics.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to abort.
Many couples had also had sex selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards one-child policies.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007, the tone of many tough slogans was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University's Department of Population Research, said that government officials have recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with one partner as an only child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters instructing families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines describing in detail who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent out municipal employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and put leaflets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice to those who have more than one child.
The response was not very encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outdoor areas of Shanghai said that an upswing can be seen in the applications of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, the urban districts do not report any change.
The municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000 still receives only four to five applications per month as an example.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the expected number of births in the city in 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee of Caolu Township in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want to have children anymore.
They want to give their first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that they would be legally allowed to do so.
But, like many Chinese people, they have only a minor health and life insurance policy from the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge one-child politics as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we're being robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the HR manager, said she only wanted a child because she was also an only child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and don't really want this."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it bluntly.
For middle-class parents with a double career, through which the birth rate decreases, he said, it revolves around being successful and for that one has to be selfish.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places huge demands on the time of parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the room question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life plan -- "If the child is 9 months old, you have to have a CV ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group designs emission reduction plan
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations -- has once again set a focus on Friday with the publication of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrial nations shouldering the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, has both identified the remaining obstacles and shown the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that will run out of time, with more than 100 top politicians from all over the world arriving in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent about the money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also provides a range of options for key issues, including how industrialised and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of global temperature rise that policy makers would support.
The process is given great flexibility, said John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what UN leaders, Yvo de Boer, called "the big picture".
It shows the outline of a possible agreement in which developed countries would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent in the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given a boost to the talks on Friday through its commitment to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from mastering floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday nevertheless brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the talks last week.
The US climate special representative Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if these are not financed by developed countries.
This train announced that the Obama administration was driving a tougher line with China than representatives of the Bush administration less than two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging economies standing up and taking action, says Stern, who also complained that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his statement an hour after the statement of the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei, which said that the leading American climate negotiator either lacked "reason" or it was "highly irresponsible" of him that he said earlier this week that the United States would not financially help China to cope with global warming.
The fact that the future economic march of the major world powers is at stake has opened fault lines both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle is about saving individual economies as well as saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting for their commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the great powers were fighting for who should bear the costs of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have become more aggressive in calling the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions to account for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, according to Ulate, who is also working as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change stated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leaders say that the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, presented a 24-page draft treaty early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states "puts political pressure on the entire political process" partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks received a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues had to be resolved before the leaders arrived to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister, escaped their planes and raced through the Bella Center corridors to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to stake claims that will be negotiated over the next week.
The pure extent of the meeting -- 13,000 people go in and out every day at the convention center, guitar-playing activists do night shows, making fun of the countries that they think are betraying and selling, and contract drafts are hand-to-hand instead of email -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Politics of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Great Britain's first 225 km/h fast train redefines Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5:13 a whistle will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and cover 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin commuter service from London.
It hopes that the new service will eventually link Britain to an international rail network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter cities, work time would be radically reduced, and the switch from aircraft and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage could still pull the brakes on British high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will hand over the report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
This will give it a detailed map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to connect London to the West Midlands will pass by urban areas and places where environmental impacts are disputed with a five-metre travel margin.
In open terrain, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger high-speed rail network leading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a Y-shaped route where a single high-speed line would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would divide in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," said a railroad insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to cover the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to a little over an hour today.
The drafts would allow trains to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, making the UK rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first line was planned in such a way that trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can travel on it for 400 metres.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be in operation on the London-Birmingham line.
This, in turn, would mean that a terminal would be needed in London where 20,000 passengers per hour could be handled.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be upgraded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be taken after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
Trains would first have to switch from high-speed lines to existing lines in the north of Birmingham, which would mean that the journey time between London and Scotland would continue to be over three hours.
This is regarded as a crucial crux to ensure a change from aircraft to rail, a measure of direction for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay for a conservative's 75,000 pound mortgage
Alan Duncan, the Conservative leader of the House of Commons, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had built in his home in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron because he complained that members of the House of Commons had to live on lean rations, has increased his mortgage by £75,000 in order to have an oak timber timber timber extension built on his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
Those in charge of the House of Commons approved the applications at that time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is carrying out a review of the expenses of the House of Commons members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could not have been "more clean or understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-story house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control center of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he built a conservatory called "Orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked by the Standards and Privileges Committee to comment on increased borrowing during a recent study of his previous mortgage contracts.
The committee acquitted him last month after examining his expenditures from breaking the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of £271,406 ($300,000) from his London house to his constituency house, which he bought in 1991, a year before his election as a Member of Parliament.
Documents published this week show that Duncan received about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) a month as mortgage interest by March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the total increase was used to finance the borrowing of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it is still standing.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month this May.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him following the spending scandal saying that members of parliament would live "from lean rations".
"In essence, working for the state means living on lean rations and being treated like S*****e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden, and I have claimed a small portion of it, in proportion to what is right.
And I could have claimed the whole damn sum, but I don't."
The MP, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May because of his spending, when it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before he had clarified with the Fees Office that this could be regarded "as an exaggerated demand".
As a protest in Duncan's lawn, an activist dug a hole in the form of a pound sign after it had become known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was questioned about the raised mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This had been approved by both the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg to increase the value."
He added: "There is no debate about dodging and sleeping or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer."
Come all you believers to admire Brighton's beach hut Advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new content of life for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that inspires spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts with Christmas carols for each December day as a theme.
The event started on 1 December and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free mulled wine and traditional mince pies filled with dried fruit pastries.
The so far selected Christmas carols are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer cleric of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
As a church, why do we expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and organize exciting celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and lively place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, where the police have made several hundreds of arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers, have marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the climate conference, the increasing mobilisation in the world for the climate contributes, as demonstrated by these demonstrations, that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed by, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Anti-disturbing police officers intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that between 600 and 700 people, according to your estimation mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, were arrested in eastern France, in April, by these extremely violent splinter groups, which have already made themselves famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were arrested "without distinction", and has underlined that about a hundred of them "still were held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and sitting position.
The rather peaceful move has gone from Parliament to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers, for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators came from the major European cities with their legs and trains, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans were present.
About 3,000 people, most of them with sky-blue raincoats, made a first casserole in Copenhagen in the morning, following the call of Earth's friends to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we are going on the streets to demand a reparation of the ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organizations.
MEP José Bové, the figure of globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, has given the starting shot for the demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, about 50,000 people have taken to the streets.
In Manila there were several hundreds of people, mostly students who marched in red and hoisted bandanas where you boasted the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, marches of several hundred demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseilles (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, denouncing Georgia that this is a "strike".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "strike".
Some 131,000 people were called upon to participate in the first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian War for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory that was recognized by Russia.
The polling stations are closed at 17 GMT.
Voter turnout was about 58% a few hours before the polling station was closed, according to the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under total Russian occupation, his press spokesperson, Manana Manjgaladze, has declared.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia that is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-93 conflict, with several thousands of people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to vote in a polling station in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian president and the head of government, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the conduct of the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to the support of Moscow, especially with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, for its part, which was represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready for action, have arrested about 700 people on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which receives delegates from 193 countries who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the centre and did not try to penetrate.
A stage was set up to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of demonstrators, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to smash windows, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Anti-unrest policemen have circled you immediately and have intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that between 600 and 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
Towards evening, a policeman suffered an injury from a paving stone on his chin during the incidents, in which, according to the police, about twenty people were arrested for the time being. Four vehicles were burning near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said Henrik Jakobsen, spokesman for the police, while the helicopters of the police were circling in the air.
Most demonstrators who arrived by train or by their own vehicle from German cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the sky-blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to form a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are taking to the streets to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," said Lidy Nacpil, an activist from the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say any more: we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that dry up, there are rivers through which you can walk, which was never the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalisation movement has approached environmental organisations.
French MEP José Bové, critic of globalisation, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who are addressing the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, about 50,000 people have taken to the streets, according to the organisers.
In Manila, a few hundred people, in the majority of them students, dressed in red with bandanas, have made advertisements for solar energy in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital.
Hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in Hong Kong and Djakarta in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people joined forces during the demonstrations organized by the "Network of 350", in particular in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerge from the school reform of the Lycéen.
In an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", the National Minister of Education Luc Chatel explained that the subjects of geography and history emerge stronger from the school reform of the Lycées, even if they are not taught in the terminals (12th school year).
"The pupils of the Première (11th school year) now have the same programme every four hours per week," confirms Mr Chatel.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but by and large a concentration of "the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific one," he continued. He underlined: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who have been outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lycees."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) were critical of the government's plan to abolish compulsory education in history and geography at Terminale S (12th school year with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also criticized this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied that there was no question of restricting the philosophy of Terminale S.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for Tuesday's protest against the project, which they believe will be the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that they would undergo a subject-related aptitude test in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and an admission test at the end of the year, which would examine their teaching skills.
In addition, they do internships during the year in the M2 and then teach one year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He continued: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance exam, you will reach even more hours you have spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The minister finally declared that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed again that he wanted to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
A journalist from the AFP noted that Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, in which experts turn to the public for fifteen minutes each with filmed contributions.
One wants to do something to reach the people and to make them feel like they want to learn more, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, said on the sidelines of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students gave to the fish in the basin of the school.
"About twenty participants were selected among the experts, even after their charisma," he explains.
"We can talk about global warming for hours, but the key objectives can also be set out in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke freely in front of about 50 people only with the help of foils.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he said, hoping that the audience will understand that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos filmed by these conferences will be available online on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Late payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
The prison officials' unions called for a general day of action on Friday in order to ensure that the premiums and overtime paid by January for budget reasons are paid before Christmas holidays.
The Second Union of Penitentiaires ("FO-Pénitentiaire"), called on those workers who were not on duty to demonstrate in front of the penitentiary on Tuesday morning and to block it in order to draw attention to the "theft of what was theirs".
The 3rd Union of Penitentiaires (CGT-Pénitentiaire) called for "to unite for a strong mobilization in the various prisons" on which the non-payment of overtime, night allowances and Sunday and holiday allowances incurred in October is branded as "indecent and unacceptable".
The first union of prison officials, the Autonomous Federal Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The administration of the prison and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime increased sharply in 2009 and not all of them were included in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
In the evening, the Ministry of Justice announced that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the prison officials' unions guaranteeing that payment would be made next month.
"I am well aware of the efforts of the staff to maintain and modernise our prison system," the Minister of Justice said in this letter.
"I have instructed the administration of the prison to take immediate action so that such a situation, which was caused by a lack of assessment of overtime, will not be repeated in the future," added Ms Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore low, except for the management staff, which benefits from high service and target premiums, explains UFAP/UNSA, for which the "budget constraints" must be held.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade union FO in Marseille indignantly announces, "to boycott all meetings and convocations" until new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and public holidays, when the hours of October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime", threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being assigned to us without more staff being hired, the attempt to enrich the staff's funds is more than inappropriate," said the CGT union of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, states the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that he is always giving Christmas better gifts than he himself is getting.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has told TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he is always giving out better gifts than he gets himself.
On a special broadcast on Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be part of the game.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," Michelle Obama confirms, adding that the dog also gets a gift, of course.
Michelle Obama firmly rejected her husband’s claims on the quality of gifts. “I gave you beautiful gifts last year,” she teases the president.
"So please," he enunciated, scathingly, pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour broadcast in an informal atmosphere with the well-known TV presenter, whom Barack Obama had so vehemently supported during his election campaign, the President and his wife also spoke about gifts that they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten gears and also a basketball that his father, whom he very rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father once visited us at Christmas and brought me a basketball game," said the president.
"Only much later in my life did I understand that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll's house," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL confirmed that he was put into artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated on in Los Angeles for serious "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was again operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors found "damages due to the operation of a herniated disc" which he had suffered in Paris on 26 November, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damages would have required a new operation.
Nevertheless, the singer's production company wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical report would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
Only after 48 hours, however, did one have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of AFP, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources it appears" that after his first operation in Paris "no drainage" was laid.
The rocker had been operated on in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a herniated disc.
The procedure, scheduled for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday evening.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the surgery.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, thought to RTL on Thursday that his friend is going through a "deep valley". However, he assured that one does not have to worry about the rock musician, since he is "a good fighter".
"He called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was bullshit to sit on a plane for 12 hours after such an operation," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacted well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection was contained".
Mr. Camus also explained that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he felt no particular concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the singer's health had increased since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general astonishment, it was said that Johnny Hallyday had a "small colon cancer surgery," resulting in a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists have not escaped the fact that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the people surrounding him had to refuse to return to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Shortway: First place for Bousquet over his favourite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on Thursday about his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short circuit in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a real record flood was expected.
One record was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m layers of gentlemen.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to reach for the world record in the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two king distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman maintained himself in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere on an international level.
Bousquet defeated Croat Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater things and in this case I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which started in 1999 in the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination has not paid off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, twice world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has prevailed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann explained.
USA : Grave plate at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman tombstone, which appeared with the French writer Emile Zola of all people, was estimated at $1.5 million on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the IIIth century AD and has always been valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysus are depicted in a sophistic architecture decor surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," explained Florent Heintz, Vice President of the Sotheby's Auction of Roman and Egyptian Antiquities, opposite the AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered the most so far," says Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous Borghese family collection, after which she appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom at her Paris hotel and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
While searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's exit attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic territory incompatible after this escort by the coup government had rejected as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place during the night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, explained the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authorities, the plane, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transfer M. Zelayas, had returned to its place of departure.
The coup government wanted to force M. Zelaya to "abandon" and ask for political asylum for him abroad under escort.
However, the overthrown president refused, as he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcome incumbent head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered another failure by trying to get me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to abdicate," said M. Zelaya to Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has often spoken out since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here well and gladly for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the overthrown president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under stops of some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for escort, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, since it does not include a request for asylum, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of the Interior of the Putsch government, declared to the Honduran Radio HRN.
I do not seek asylum in any country at all, had answered Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had pointed out, would only take place as president of the Honduran people.
On Wednesday, the rumors of M. Zelaya's departure had mobilized the supporters of the overthrown president, who had gone to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, and the military there had stepped up its efforts.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international norms.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28, the day of the referendum he organized in preparation for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
He had returned from his exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be imprisoned for treason, which he is accused of by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
Putsch President Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organising a presidential election on 29 November to replace M. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo had been recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, but had been rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, the Kogress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street upswing, US trade balance nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed with a high on Thursday, the figures on the American trade balance testify to a price recovery of the shares of the United States and their partners: the Dow Jones increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor ́s 500 was written with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There is good news from various industries, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial said.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market only focuses on "half-full glasses", she moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on the figures of the American trade balance "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States’ trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October compared to September.
The analysts, on the other hand, expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of the Business Research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States rose last week, contrary to all expectations, and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average number of new jobseekers had "falled to the low point of the year during the last four weeks," stressed Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3.482% compared to 3.432% on Tuesday night, the profitability of the bonds to 30 years to 4.492% compared to 4.408% on the eve.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans in power whistle "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, several hundreds of Cuban partisan women gathered in Havana for the purpose of World Human Rights Day have been tricked out by political prisoners and have also thwarted another rally, for which a dozen dissidents have been temporarily arrested.
Around forty "women in white", wives or close-ups of political prisoners, were whistled out on the open street by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on their way to the center of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Merchants!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Fidel and Raul live!" chanted the authorized partisans with a raised fist to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "guarantee their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" took place in Havana on the evening before, during which there were no casualties or arrests.
A reporter from the AFP confirmed that a dozen dissidents, who also went to the demonstration on Thursday in the face of International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civilian police in the district of Vedado.
According to this journalist, the police forced the dissidents booed by the guerrillas of the government to enter civilian vehicles under force.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As a candidate for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Women in White" organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of "requesting the release of all political prisoners", whose number is around 200 according to the dissident list, Laura Pollan, one of the leaders, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a prison term of 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, 53 of whom are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities regard the opponents of the regime as "merchants" or "agents" in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstrations taking place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "contra-revolutionarys".
Cuba, led by a united party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of denigrating rights and freedoms, in particular those of freedom of expression.
Insanity kills eighty-year-olds with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A maniac armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old on Friday against late afternoon during the main business hours in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (skin-de-his) and injured five more people.
According to the first information from the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old with two knives in or in front of a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, according to police reports, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, died in the hospital of the consequences of his injuries, according to a member of the Alliance Police Syndicate.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he has a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in his thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were sent to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of his life, as, according to police sources, vital organs have apparently been affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in "shock condition" according to a police source.
The armed man, who according to the police seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, immediately escaped to the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passers-by, apparently by chance: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old, the latter of them heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher's knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, explained on site Arnaud Pressé, a leader of the Syndicate Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine region.
According to the AFP witnesses, several passers-by, including young people, have tried to tame the madman.
I saw a guy in his thirties with a green vest.
Three youths tried to intervene.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, reported Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A horde fell on him, he added, including a city police officer who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61, two city police officers, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were stabbed, according to police reports.
The event took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passers-by came to me to tell me there's an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put her in first aid position and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, was injured by cuts.
Armed forces of the state police finally arrested the man who did not carry identification papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office has commissioned the district department of the Hauts-de Seine Criminal Police Department (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source doesn't rule out him being admitted to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, there were six police officers to tame him at the Clichy Police Commissariat, where he had been taken away.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" like "all mental confusions of this kind, in which the forces are released during the course of the incident".
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls for a new stop to prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly demanded that the prosecution of his client, who is currently in court at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral violation of more than 30 years ago, be dropped in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) on Thursday.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", denounced three judges of the Court of Appeal in the second district of California gross procedural errors at the time of the trial in 1977.
I demand immediate remission, said M. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was charged with the case at the time of the trial, "let it run down your back cold."
According to him, Judge Rittenband, who had died in the meantime, had discussed his verdict with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to be in prison, which was a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and coveted), especially by the prosecutor David Wells.
At the end of September, M. Wells had finally declared that the authors of the documentary had "lied".
If the Court of Justice refuses to close the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel would ask for a trial to enable him to present the evidence for his reasoning.
For its part, the prosecution has repeated the evidence already explained at first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the annulment of the facts charged to the accused cannot be seriously considered unless Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the USA in 1978, even before the announcement of the sentence for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He has not travelled to the United States since that time.
The Los Angeles County Deputy Prosecutor, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that escape is a way out?, asks Mrs. Asayma.
In their opinion, "the filmmaker asks the court for a favor and thus despises his authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even pointed out "that there are other escape alternatives".
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the termination of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded that the criminal proceedings be lifted again.
She recalled that her client would no longer endure being harassed by every resurgence of Affaire Polanski and added: "No one in this room can say that this trial was just.
Thirty-two years is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September on the occasion of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed down by the rise in the dollar and closes without price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed off on Friday in a market torn between better indicators than the US and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures available at closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
"Honestly, the market is quite quiet," Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management noted.
"It remains strictly limited, the volume of trade has become very small and I think this will continue until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than envisaged, which "contributed to improving the market view to the solidity of the recovery of the economy", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and much more than planned.
Furthermore, American consumer confidence improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to index previews by the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes were slowed down by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level against the euro for the last two months, pushing ''the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation down'", said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
The 10-year Treasury bond yield rose by 3.540% on Wednesday evening, compared with 3.482%, and that of the 30-year bond rose to 4.497%, compared with 4.492% of the previous day.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month's round trip through South Africa, the 112 candidates to the title of Miss World will cross the last hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world, and this in front of a billion TV viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which is being held for the second time in a row in the Johannesburg area, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a veritable vortex of pleasure.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, were simply exceptional.
I have seen many things and had a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition takes place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday, from 5 p.m. (3 p.m. Central European Time) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the miss is now concentrating on the contest.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
Of course, it's every woman's dream to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I would like to come home with the crown, throws Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defile in traditional costumes and not to forget in swimsuit.
The performance is presented by a TV presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the South African ex-beauty queen, Michelle McLean, and a member of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that the world knows how to receive with an unsurpassable warmth and pride, says Julia Morley, Chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, did a safari to visit the famous township in Soweto, but this time they did so by bike and local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, is undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (South West) for the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to promote this event a little more.
I'm wrong about people I'm probably never gonna get close to.
I will certainly come back to the 2010 World Cup, Miss Italy enthusiastically promised Alice Taticchi.
According to his son David, the news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive"
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive," his son David assured him on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he got off the plane, in which he arrived from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m. CET).
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured him that he would "fastly" go to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on a disc incident on November 26th.
The singer "was put into an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and perform his treatment," the press said.
Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma by the doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following a disc surgery on November 26th.
The singer had to undergo surgery again during the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes caused by the last operation.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event on Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer from the AFP noted.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic and Traumatological Surgery at Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer has severely burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer on 26 November at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had done the purest massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said that they were indignant, Mr. Camus explained.
I've heard about the possibility of a trial being initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "traveled far too quickly and with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I made a personal phone call with this doctor who assured me that he saw this journey as completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I have already had two intervertebral disc surgeries behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital "without drainage, without anything" after the operation.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artist's environment.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a cerebral hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted of tax evasion and fraud several times because of failed operations and not to be forgotten.
Me Olivier Metzner, attorney of the Medical Association, has described him as "a man without scruples", who is "regularly" responsible to the board of directors and "everything else is recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention was "perfect" and that the post-operative investigations were "normal".
The operation "does not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been running since this summer, seems to be in question.
It is clear that it is a bit too short for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens), said Mr. Camus.
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) party alliance becomes energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre party not to use its seal anymore.
The party alliance, which is supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem party, reacted violently on Friday to an attempt to take over the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, by the chairman of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and called on him, under threat of legal prosecution, to no longer use this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal because he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political legacy after he had handed the hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In order to strengthen his efforts, he had received the support of the MP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now NC), who claims the property of the UDF trademark, since he was the first to apply for this trademark in 2004 at the "Institut national de la proprieté industrielle".
However, the office of the UDF party alliance supervised by François Bayrous' friends broke the silence and clearly indicated that they did not allow themselves to be expropriated and, under threat of legal prosecution, set a deadline for the Minister and the MP to stop using this seal and to transfer the property rights of the trademark to it.
In recent days, you have made numerous statements that you would propose to your political movement to +take the UDF seal+, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You probably also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today's UDF +, printed on your political material as well as on the home page of your website.
As you know, you are not entitled to the use of this seal, the UDF office explained and urged the party NC to "immediately remove the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (their) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the property rights of the trademark to its legal entitled parties".
If you refuse to do so, we will bring a lawsuit against you to ensure respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends "have made the choice" to leave it in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had done in 2002 to found the UMP party.
According to the signatories, the Nouveau centre party has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 approved the three-year membership of the MoDem Party and the establishment of a branch to defend "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "at the time when he applied for the brand name, he had been no longer a member of the UDF for three years" but of the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of deposit of the acronym UDF to carry this out for himself.
You also point out that this recklessness is the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the strategy of the NC: "It seems more dignified to us in politics as well as in life to make a name for yourself, rather than trying to get out of anonymity by, fraudulently, appropriating a name in which you have no legal claims".
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier condemned for exploitation of weakness
On Friday, the Nanterre Court of Justice decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he has exploited a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to steal part of their property.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photographs, will have to answer for the exploitation of weakness in court on 15 and 16 April 2010, a crime punishable by a maximum imprisonment of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are torn apart and at the same time the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal are in their hands.
However, the 15th Trial Chamber also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is conducted jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to submit to such an investigation, especially not under the conditions submitted by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will present a report before 10 March 2010 in which you will make clear whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to go through these tests.
I will talk to her, explained the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very pleased with the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady, whom one must protect, he affirmed.
For two years now, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has initiated a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of having exploited her mother's weakness for years in order to steal donations of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always disproved that she had been manipulated by the photographer, whom she regards as a long-time friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit initiated by Ms Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' plaidoyers led to a large family debacle on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer relied on three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she distrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyer's husband.
According to her lawyer Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please tell my daughter that I have written to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
I have never been able to speak to Françoise since her marriage."
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office is again of the opinion that the applicant had no right to react in this way, especially because in recent days a guardian judge has refused to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not protected and has no guardian.
Nobody has the right to act in their place," said the prosecutor's representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court of First Instance has now decided to give a judgment after the procedure for the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager revolution or the end of the Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in terms of its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumer prior to the marketing revolution: It is intended for the personnel to join "values" destined to impose the best as it used to be on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By putting the customer at the center of companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products separately factors preferences of customers again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially those of R&Eand, which is even more crucial, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) demands "a proactive approach and a forward-looking view from all parties involved"; it claims from the employees a commitment to which the instructions of authoritarian management completely contradict.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution, which would consist in placing the employees in the center of the company's concerns on an equal footing with the customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its wage earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I've been able to see that, given a new situation, after many detours, the whole structure finally comes to do, as a matter of priority, what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a much simplified idea of human behavior.
Their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic from the major engineering schools.
Through intellectual comfort, they adopt the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the American "neurosciences" and unknowingly widely spread by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "sic" to engage employees, a recent Le Figaro.fr survey by Ipsos encourages executives in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for wage earners, commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it clearly appears to be a means of realizing part of their dreams, ambition and intentions.
At the moment only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take on this concept of motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a given doxa that allows them to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their human resource management in the right place again.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is favourable for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The Oslo speech: the "just war" brings praise to Obama from the right
The American Right welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo on Friday evening and was pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who mocked the awarding of the prize to Obama on October 9 applauded the President's speech this time, following the example of the former Vice-Presidentship candidate in the 2008 elections, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the face of the Republican Party's right wing in the USA Today newspaper, and added that she herself raised the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs published in the same way.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of force in Oslo on Thursday; a way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, believed that the President had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I thought that the speech was really very good, ex-president of the House of Representatives exclaimed, who particularly acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, I felt that this speech was entirely historical, Ginrich explained, who was interviewed in the radio show "The Takeaway".
The previous MP, who is regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left" reminding the members of the Nobel Committee that they "are not free and cannot give a price for peace if the use of force would not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has given "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "cosmopolitan" as "he always does", he has "speaked like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live like in a security bubble that they have not created themselves and for whose protection they do not do much", says Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a hawk of the Bush era, described the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "boring, tedious and inspirative."
To the left of the president, democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the recourse to the armed forces.
If you pack the war under the guise of justice, you can easily justify the massacre of the innocent, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, continues to praise the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama prematurely, called the speech "Monumental Work" even for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "offers a roadmap for managing international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California daily excites.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time."
Drivers: Three marathons for an agreement to secure the supply for Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the unions of the Road Association and the TLF - the only employers' organization that remained until the end - reached an agreement on Friday evening that would put an end to the strike order and the impending severe shortage of supplies at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "welcomed" the agreement which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators parted early on Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement quickly in the late morning.
And even though the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting furiously.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. to the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was not signed until 18:00 p.m.
The conflict "had caused a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year", said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
"That's not much, but we'll start small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now being instructed not to block the supply centres.
"However, there will probably always be some unruly people who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF president Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke about "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and the maintenance of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will in particular make it possible to address the issue of 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of employers' taxes of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the bill for the adjusted finances for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government demands "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated to this organisation and then, if extended by the Minister of Labour, to the entire profession.
This will be the case "in no time", Bussereau assures.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
FNTR denounced "fraudy trade" because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for some of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to upset the goose eaters on the approaching Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre association, the agreement threatens "to dig a grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disorders this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disruptions to the RER A line, France's largest high-speed rail network for the Greater Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued at the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second day of the strike between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris Passenger Transport Administration) kept the strikers waiting for their demands for wage increases.
There were no trains on this important shopping weekend before Christmas between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one in two trains was operational and only one in four trains outside the central line.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced the passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is trying to connect the large shops with traffic technology".
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The section of the RATP connects Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains operated on schedule at peak hours, and almost none during the low-traffic period.
As on Thursday, there was no human commotion on the platforms, as the residents of the Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, mainly because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29) explained that he had got up extra "one and a half hours earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to take care of passengers by staff and administrative staff, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left via Saint-Lazare station to ensure connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday there were again general meetings of the strikers, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the leaders on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career paths, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they are demanding a long-due wage supplement.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself put its pay supplement proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership "is not able to solve a problem, whereas this was also possible for the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting would be scheduled for Monday to "comprehensively examine working conditions".
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leader who, until now, refused any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after calming the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to spread to the RER B line after a preliminary announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage supplement of 120 (Ussa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants), and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, where millions of travellers travel every day.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a wage supplement of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision followed immediately by furious demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government enormously difficult, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "place for activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", according to the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes being required to impose the dissolution. Furthermore, he pointed out that 37 of the party’s leaders, including the chairman Ahmet Türk and the parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political action for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the waiver of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the Party's property.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Before the verdict, the party leaders said that parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than sit like non-partisan parliamentarians.
The decision was followed by a trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "wisdoms" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is regarded by Ankara and numerous other countries as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court intercedes with the government, which seeks to meet the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, in order to make the support of the PKK by the Kurds run out and to put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP affirm that a resolution could lead to a re-emergence of tensions in South-East Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the prison conditions of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP premises in the megacity of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
The police used tear gas grenades and water cannons when the demonstrators started throwing molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court's decision "will deepen despair even further".
"Turkey cannot resolve this (Kurdish, editorial note) question on the basis of a party's ban," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose the closure of the parties on principle.
This does not solve the problems," said Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously get ready for a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
Snowfall may come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
It is so that its employees can try and learn to master the entire vehicle technology.
According to meteorologists, it could be the first time this weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES will proceed according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows all over Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes are driven off with large stray vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include major roads and thoroughfares such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire brigade accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with gradients, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
If necessary, the approximately 1040 kilometres would have to be sprinkled in a maximum of three hours with moist salt that adheres better.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning, "so that the routes are free until the traffic starts".
It'll be difficult if it doesn't snow until 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the stray vehicles".
Only after that, if it doesn't continue to snow, are access roads and access roads, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning the footmen of the FES set off, danger points and crossings are cleared as a priority.
The FES is usually not able to take care of all bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges, says Brauburger, from 10 to 4.30 p.m.
Since there is quick smoothness on this, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the spreader is on the way.
If necessary, the police will also call him.
The cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: the two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-large animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be anything special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body traits, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
About 215 million years ago, the animal lived in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for triassic deposits, team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History reports.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
In the course of the excavation, they collected the remains of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino's early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, mostly only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current doctrine, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these primordial dinos is usually controversial.
For example, the experts discuss when the lizards split into their three main development lines: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the four-legged sauropods known as "long necks" and their relatives, and the plants-eating Ornithischia (bird-basin dinosaurs), which included the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus, for example.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropode.
He has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air bags, as did the descendants of the Theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, birds' breathing is more efficient than mammals' breathing.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropode with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the giant sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight bones, the common ancestor of both groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
According to this, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America over all parts of the world, which then formed a single land mass as a supercontinent of Pangäa.
This is supported by the fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not very closely related theropods.
The researchers argue that the three cannot be descended from a common immigrant ancestor.
We believe there were at least three migratory waves to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, a distorted picture could arise, because in South America many primitive dinosaur fossils have simply been preserved, while on other continents hardly anything can be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile trunk to the dominant land vertebrates of the Earth's Middle Ages is still puzzling.
During the Triassic the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flight dinosaurs and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while the relationship on the border from the Triassic to the Jura died out.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs happened to survive, but the other reptiles didn't.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals to bloom, which had also developed in the Triassic, and since then, a shadow existence has lasted: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors of the University of Toronto are on it, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are present, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of Frankfurt's Goethe University is causing waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, but also from universities all over Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarityd with the protesting students on Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police operation initiated by the Presidium.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike cleared last week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories ruled, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command."
The eviction was an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the denigitimization and criminalization of protest" and distracts from the content.
The Presidium had withdrawn from the necessary discourse.
The lecturers demand the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage to property, they say.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the Verdi union and the German Trade Union Confederation also solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi Landes Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
However, Hessen's science minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the university president and the police.
We're grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbadener Landtag.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand vandalism, according to CDU member Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Left saw this differently.
The CDU uses painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, one had cleared.
The Left has tabled a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a heavily guarded site for secret military research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from Moscow center, is considered as the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production sites for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have established contacts with the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol on closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd headed the Russian delegation, and Edwin Schwarz, the planning officer for Frankfurt, signed.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized companies of the scientific research focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to win contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the major companies Sitronics and Rossijskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for armament research.
Selenograd (literally "Grünstadt") received its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgart brake block
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
Right. S21 is much more than the lowering of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of Baden-Württemberg's capital for a decade into unholy construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 originated from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headyards with tracks ending in the middle of the city were then regarded as 19th-century traffic-related fossils, which looked like brake blocks of modern rail transport, as it once took enormous time to span locomotives from behind to front.
Drive in, hold on, keep going - that's how it should go.
And that's why the head railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station located halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - that's why the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian big cities it is almost priceless to implement the lowering.
However, head stations no longer have an entry and exit problem since there are modern turn-over trains with railcars and steering cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 and the new ICE line to Ulm are now being tackled.
National and local politicians have enforced it.
The railways are taking part, also because the risks of the largest single infrastructure project of the Republic of taxpayers and not the state-owned corporation are borne.
The project can still be reasonably justified in terms of urban planning.
New urban space is created, which - if one believes the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The through station and the line extension are intended for passenger transport, to which - typical 80s - huge growth was attributed.
At that time there was not yet the competition of cheap aircraft.
However, modern transport policy must first of all be aimed at strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport by truck.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy gradients.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
A good six billion euros will be buried in Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that ten to 15 billion are realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade, money will be missing from other nodes and constrictions on the net.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, slow motion trains have been built on the route.
It would be urgently necessary to press the tube correctly here.
But S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rhine Valley line becomes the bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbadener Landtag whether it will go against the verdict of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban in revision.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page VGH ruling examined legally, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
On those days, the VGH in Kassel had stated in writing that, in the event of the construction of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport, the country would have to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The registration of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as provided by the state government, is not compatible with the legal protection of the population against nightly noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it will go against the verdict in revision.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the representatives of the government to renounce a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this was to be regarded as a "word break".
It's damn hard to keep your word, Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, alluding to the FDP election slogan, "We keep our word."
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's accusation that the state government was trying to get to their night flights with "right-wing twisting and trickery".
An exact legal examination needs its time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition portrays it, his faction's statements on the night flight ban had never been.
US banks pay back help
The crisis-ridden U.S. major banks are stripping off their state shackles.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America repaid the aid from the Tarp bank rescue fund in the amount of a total of 45 billion dollars (a good 30 billion euros) in one go.
According to a report by the US broadcaster CNBC, the Citigroup is also planning to repay the state aid.
The institutions want to remove the restrictions associated with the acceptance of the money – such as the limit on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had received over $19 billion of fresh money from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the sum out of her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by branch sales.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis explicitly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday night: the injection of money had helped over a very difficult time.
At the height of the financial crisis, the money house had faced up to the takeover of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also intends to raise money on the capital market to exempt itself from its liabilities to the State.
Already on Thursday, the US bank could announce a 20 billion dollar increase in its capital, reports CNBC, citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesman did not want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid.
Fast choice
It all went faster than I thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors pushed the acting editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the panel wanted to vote on the personality.
Peter Frey, director of the ZDF Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin, was a favourite.
However, there was no confirmation from the station - officially, in order not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it may have played a role not to further damage ZDF director Markus Schächter if this proposal is not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The result of the vote was not yet determined at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had failed on the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's election was a bitter defeat for Schachter, but one that could be expected.
The majority of the Union on the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election that they did not want to confirm Brender in office.
The resistance against the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had been organized.
With the argument that, under Brender, the news broadcasts of ZDF had lost ratings, he refused another term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election there were therefore protests in which the political influence on ZDF was scourged.
Finally, even 35 constitutionalists had intervened in the debate, who considered Koch’s actions unconstitutional.
It didn't do any good.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance studies.
He then worked at Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, initially to "heute-journal".
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 director of the ZDF foreign policy; since then director of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit following the election of Brender, who was voted Journalist of the Year on Wednesday by the industry journal Medium Magazin.
Koch's counterpart on the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also excluded an excerpt from the supervisory boards of ZDF by party politicians.
Brender's likely successor, Peter Frey, had recommended a wise move to the Board of Directors by strongly criticising the board immediately after the election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, both Schächter and the board of directors were able to nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing their face, without suspecting that they would take up office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is anyway attributed to the left-liberals.
Studying Is Disturbed
Partial success for the students: After a year of the educational strike, the ministers of culture of the countries finally took part on Thursday: At a meeting of the Ministers of Culture and the Rectors of Higher Education, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the examination burden: In principle, each study module should only complete with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of the students is to be checked and "a realistic and justifiable measure" guaranteed.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries undertook to make common structural requirements for Bachelor's and Master's programmes more flexible.
Moreover, there should be no derogating country rules.
Fewer tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Minister of Culture and University Rectors have borne the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of exams in some cases drastically: "Each module usually concludes with only one exam", says a 30-page paper, which is to partially regulate the admission of courses of study.
With the "significant reduction of the examination burden", the accreditation council chairman Reinhold Grimm said, a "misdevelopment should be stopped, which significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, "studyability" is to be in future "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content should be "strictly checked" whether "unnecessary limitations of students in the choice of
This is not the case in the United States.
The students would have "a claim to maintain room for manoeuvre, to enable and promote their own initiative".
The rules should apply to the admission of new courses, but also to the examination of existing ones.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – which means, however, that it will take until 2015 until all courses of study have been reviewed.
This is the responsibility of ten accreditation agencies nationwide, which are under the responsibility of the Accreditation Council set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Culture "emphasized" the countries' efforts to influence the agencies so that the quantity of material is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed on appropriate measures with the state ministries.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has committed additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
From this money, the universities are to set up tutor programmes and strengthen student advice as well as examination and foreign offices.
The country and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce an amendment to the Higher Education Act into the parliament.
After this, only one test is required to complete a study model.
The aim is to make study design more flexible, to ensure recognition of qualifications at other universities and to facilitate access to the Master's degree.
By the end of next year, all courses of study in the country are to be checked for their feasibility.
The government and opposition had once again argued about the conditions of study in the country on Thursday.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso University Groups demanded that the shaping of education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
After the educational strikes at the latest, the students as affected should now also "talk a word".
The future academics received support from the President of the Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture with which the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
The trade union for education and science (GEW) did not go far enough with the decisions taken in Bonn as a whole: it demands a legal claim that allows every graduate with a Bachelor's degree to access a further Master's degree course.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that sufficient master's degree courses with the best possible study conditions are available for the current generation of Bachelor students tomorrow, says GEW board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to recruit significantly more lecturers.
However, the ministers of culture did not comment on a freer access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and from there is almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he addresses the arrival experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic space.
Born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, Werner Söllner first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, he caused a considerable extra-literary sensation during a meeting in Munich, which was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of its securitate acts".
Söllner left a statement in which he admitted his cooperation as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the participants, Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun creepingly, first in 1971.
I'm, concluded Söllner, "so someone who hasn't stood up enough to intimidate the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize ceremony for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary examination of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that identifies the abysses and defamation of a political system based on surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can tell from previous knowledge, not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
In his Securitate file IM Walter played a role, said the literary scholar Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and pointed to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He had "cut it out" in all the difficult points for him at the time, says Markel.
It was a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, but it is not surprising that a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service was committed.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate-Spitzel, had written by Herta Müller already in July in the time after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
The people affected, one might suspect, will have speculated and in some cases probably also known which clear name was hidden behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike in this country, the handling of the legacy of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
Systematic education has been defrauded and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the processing of the Securitate files (CNSAS) was established in 1999 by the Birthler authorities, but the publication of the files has been slow since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very strong was confirmed by an interview following the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which a former Securitate chief from Timesvar spoke disparagingly about the prize winner.
She has a psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself here quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the Söllner case, as is so often the case with concealed guilt, is linked to inevitable questions.
Why now? Who has been harmed? The prudent reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more by the urge to know rather than by blame and shame.
It is more than a footnote to the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday.
Saturation Supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there was just a neatly dressed fieldman coming from a very nice Christmas party, at which a sporting goods manufacturer had distributed Goodies, when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the outfitter, rose a quarter of an hour after midnight into a called C-Class. ̈
The man with the distinctive baldness had himself chauffeured because of the still foreign city.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - after all alcohol was not in the game, and drunk with luck the 55-year-old was just as little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work continues.
Or really get going.
In the words of the Swiss, who had just signed three days earlier: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 victory against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is coming up on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat in Mainz the royal class performance in the league everyday life.
And to put aside the weaknesses revealed again after the fast three gates by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Draw
The eighth final of the Champions League (in games 16./17. + 23./24 February/ in games 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy of the Babbel successor's brilliant debut remained restrained.
Not only with the supposed healer, who had imparted confidence, commitment and joy to the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time.
I approached the players and told them to reflect on their strengths, and I stopped them from being braver, Soul Clamper Gross explained the so simple-sounding recipe for success, which had no effect under therapist Babbel.
He has sparked a certain magic, Babbel's supporter Jens Lehmann admitted, "when a new impulse comes in football, things sometimes happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, thanks to his dynamism, immediately became the best player on the pitch after weeks of injury break, tried to describe the established "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working methods of the new superior: "He is a man who penetrates and demands discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel it had obviously been lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns sports executive Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs first and foremost Constance.
Like Gross, players and managers also protected themselves from overestimating the victory against a completely overburdened defense of the Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen the evil awakening came at 0:4, Khedira gave thought to.
And sports executive Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal was achieved, the other was still a long way off.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt did not feel like celebrating on his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were revived in the form of a TV interview by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, which was broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, hero countered the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had shown the board leadership weakness and decided to change coaches on pressure from pulverizing fans.
Lehmann also considered that his day off after playing had been cancelled as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmann's statements were "influenced by pure egoism", Heldt keilt back and announced consequences for the final man.
I don't think they're gonna be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
However, they agreed with everyone else that without the preparatory work by the replaced coach team, the playful and combative strong performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a big part in the success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
World Championship Fight in Heavyweight
Hitty duel in Bern: Again and again challenger Kevin Johnson provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to version of the WBC.
The judge's verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains boxing world champion in heavyweight.
The 38-year-old champion after version of the WBC team defeated the US-American Kevin Johnson unanimously after points (120-108, 120-108, 119-109) during the night of Saturday in Bern.
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout everybody expected didn't work out.
Klitschko expanded his record to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give himself beaten due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Berner Arena, the 2.02 meter Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
However, the eleven-centimeter-small Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly escaped the beatings of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights to the finish line.
Overall, passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to make ends meet.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve laps with Klitschko.
The challenger had caused some fuss before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right."
In weighing, the champion was then provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years of time out, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and retrieved "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to surrender without a fight.
This year he defeated Chris Arreola from the United States and Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba.
I got only one blow in this fight and I am physically very well in shape, Klitschko had established a quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the VBO and IBF associations.
The belt of the WBA, however, is worn by the British David Haye, who was able to dethrone Nikolai Valuev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight planned for September against Vitali Klitschko in the summer.
He is said to be planning to fight Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin has described defence minister Guttenberg as a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and Left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the Kunduz air raid, the opposition has assumed defense minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The minister had said "knowingly the untruth" about the deadly bombardment on two tanker trains from September, said Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Tagesschau".
It's commonly called lying.
The order to kill had been issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had, which Mr Guttenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it had become known that the attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about killing two Taliban leaders.
According to NATO, up to 142 people had been killed or injured in the US air raid requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
On Saturday, the Greens, the SPD and the Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately to the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Federal Government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellor's Office, the Bundeswehr and the Intelligence Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
He said that the Chancellery had no influence on concrete deployments by the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the Ministry's presentation of the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have correctly and completely informed about the background of the tank truck attack.
Officially, it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the background of the two top officials, they reported that they had even referred to several reports from the Ministry of Defense, including a two-page document by the commanding Colonel Klein and a field fighter report.
Wichert is said to have asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He has not yet received an answer, they say.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the committee of inquiry of the Bundestag, which wants to constitute itself next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in awake condition and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
The boundaries between imagination and reality become blurred not only in the mentally ill and in the drug rush.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything's fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we are allowed to indulge uninhibited in the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience dreamlike conditions in growth, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicted in the modern Western world, at least as a weirdo.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the case of the mentally ill or in the drug rush.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, delusion and reality blur.
Dream-like altered waking consciousness states can occur in various forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusion.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of Rapture, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal messenger substances of the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction of different brain parts is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him
The connection between delusion and dream has been occupied by philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle saw hallucinations as a form of the dream in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great similarity of madness with dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, delusions, illusions of such."
It's autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky.
Gravity has no power over him, he's floating on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil-figures with blood-red, distorted faces, teeth-fleshing.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices roar out of walls and radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, knots them into a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He gets on a speaker and puts the noose around his neck.
Jump.
The noose is loosening.
This should be a lesson to you, the voices screaming in drum-peel-shattering choir, "go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years ago, the first is almost 20 years old.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medications for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The illusions are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, sufferers can usually no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they get into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, megalomania, relationship or persecution.
Voice listening is particularly common - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected person is no longer able to separate important things from unimportant things, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician of the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the centre of the event, everything has a meaning directed at it.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he is overwhelmed by the events, like in a dream, and he cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenic patients therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
They are not usually able to compare reality, the illusions are cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Once in a lifetime to have experienced a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, remains fundamentally preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place within a real framework.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers are still puzzled.
Exceptions can lead to a short-term loss of reality in every human being, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development by a mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, for example, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery how the disorder of the neural system comes about, which is not manifesting for many years at first.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brains run hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get them, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether false images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a question of viewpoint.
For ten years, Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and delusions, and last year he evaluated his findings in the book "The Irreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are among the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of astoundingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease and cranial brain trauma.
Surprisingly, even the brain of healthy people is hallucinated under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memory contents that are normally held back.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain is running hot or even when stimulation is missing.
Drugs can cause this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also excitement, stress, heartbreak or other mental states of exception.
In recent studies, up to a third of those surveyed claimed to have experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the Gymnasium there.
A normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the pictures and voices.
During the break it can happen that a shaky boy with long, dark hair appeals to it.
When it answers him, the classmates look surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this boy and the other illusions are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are usually frightening
Often the illusions are also a burden.
When she is sitting in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher is introducing a new classmate in her eyes and ears, while he is explaining mathematical equations for all the others, both hearingly and visibly, on the board.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which is far too rare and far too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees are the faces or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell her about it, they think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed her Abitur last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she made contact with the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from excitement, he is most likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suppose the brain is then underworked and provides its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls Papa has not been her biological father since she could think.
Since the same brain areas are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations, which also process real impressions and noises, it is difficult for people like Sarah K. to distinguish between illusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, which is why they work so real."
Even nightly dream pictures treat caste as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their delusions as unreal.
Therefore, Kasten advises his patients to value hallucinations as a special ability.
Border State between Dream and Hallucination
Unfortunately, in our overly mind-centered world, imaginary experiences are mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful illness, but it also contains positive, creative - delusion is also a work of art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroid experience form, a special form of dream-like altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the experiencer considers real and which he cannot distinguish from the state of waking even in hindsight.
The oneironoid state of consciousness arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with loss of self and world, for example, by persistent, complete immobility of movement, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline between dream and hallucination.
Since overcoming a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, but the real situation is visualized in imagination.
An intensive form of sense and meaning in a situation that is in itself unbearable, which enables us humans to create our own ability not to sink into a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve operation followed by a heart transplant, while his body in the intensive care unit is doomed to motionlessness.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who make drugs from blood.
Moved by a Greek on a motorcycle to his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the firn snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He is fully absorbed in the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in memory.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental travels are still overly clear to me after years and in minor details.
Clearer and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience bursts the horizon of our other life-worldly experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug rush show how fragile our inner images of outer reality are in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist caste, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
Snowfall may come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publisher Kallen is an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children in the long term, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding company should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told the SPIEGEL.
We have arranged the details for this as a precaution.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only after that.
The question is also whether they are able to do so.
You can't put 7500 employees in front of your children if they are not adequately qualified.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he would withdraw from the Board of Directors from January, and Paul-Bernhard Kallen had been appointed his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member of Burda since 1999.
At first, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury division, responsibility for the company's assets came into play, and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's retirement, also for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the head of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years", according to Burda.
The holding company should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family, Burda said.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe from the downfall: "This always concerned families who were infected by a capital addiction that had completely speculated and thought that they could rise to become a very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had "never dreamed of world power," Burda said.
I do not see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play in the world league with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least that's what El Corte Inglés has planned to do, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), where everything revolves around personal care.
In the wellness area, located on the eighth floor, one finds among other prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide a depilation with laser; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner and at the same time have a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to set up your own "beauty party" with eight friends and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has these kinds of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touchscreen that is opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to perform your workouts properly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm up and stretching exercises) are enough to train the body muscles.
And if you want to stop by the hair salon after you have trained your body, Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments for regaining the beauty of your hair, shine and health for your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. in the evening 365 days a year.
The most diverse cleavage
Christmas is getting closer and closer and therefore it is again a good opportunity to copy the looks of the stars and bring their festive dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated cleavage. You can only advise against it.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa has created the "LIVE office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements regarding mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVILE project is being developed to promote electric cars and to summarise the opinions and actions of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (La Generalitat).
The aim of this framework agreement is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, those related to energy and, in particular, to its efficiency.
However, it is by no means the only initiative that Endesa participates in with regard to the promotion of electric cars.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of calm".
At the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the Prime Minister, Zapatero recalled the measures the government has taken to support the automotive sector during the year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, today we would have a panorama of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the Global Plan for the Automotive Industry (PIA), has allocated EUR 800 million to projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The head of government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's efforts to boost demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, which is being applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows for an average reduction of 6% in the exhaust emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased "by 40 percent" in November.
On 20,000 quadrameter classic vehicles
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Classic Motor Show, an exhibition for experts and fans of the world of engines.
This fair will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pabellón de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
On an exhibition space of 20,000 square meters, 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will present their brands.
You can not only admire classic motorcycles and vehicles, but you will also find all imaginable articles in connection with the world of engines at ClassicAuto Madrid.
For example, exhibitors can find accessories, spare parts, components, fabric accessories, accessories, publications, miniature cars, etc. at the trade fair.
Hundreds of items from the world of classic engines that will delight collectors and lovers.
Among the companies that will participate in this fair are among others Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, vehicle sales; Juan Lumbreras, restorations; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of automobiles, specializing in Mercedes Benz.
Skill tests in the outside area
In addition, the sales activities at this fair are complemented by parallel events: meetings, sports vehicle exhibitions, skill tests, events and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a specially designed race track in the outside area of the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmental Sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sport is compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start-up system of the engine, named i-Stop, in the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 stands out by its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can find that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
The steering wheel is also excellent.
Further looking at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, one can see that Mazda is on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the spectacular colors red and blue.
This style reminds us in part of the style of the Honda Civics.
That is why it can easily be said that both Mazda 3 and Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers the appropriate comfort more than ever so that four adults can travel comfortably by car.
All this is accompanied by a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start system is currently only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed gear shift.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out through its fineness, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with gasoline engine because of its great comfort in gear shifting and its low consumption, even if Mazda's diesel models are the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test run is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
From the serial equipment stands out above all the assistant for the lane change (RVM), which eliminates the blind angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning system, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth as well as the chromed 17-inch rims.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the package Premium, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learnable Bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, because of its handling and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is its slightly high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the model Luxury and 23,270 euros for the tested model Sportive.
However, in return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us the highest driving fun every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red teppich of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, radiated more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is very limited, a device with which one can read only his e-mails, without a possibility to see certain attachments or to surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is still of particular interest to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very low flat rate, for example only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the success of this, the company has launched two new devices: one intended only for Twitter, the other with a life-long free data service, in contrast to the Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American counterpart, but has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to do without all the data in order to be able to read their emails once you have crossed the country border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with Flatrate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and good glasses to read all the fine print.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs across Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have Wifi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariffs means that telephone providers have to think slowly but surely and start to consider different ways in which they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and further inquiries on the Internet.
Without contract and without hooks.
This is an Internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, when you buy it, and not month after month.
And that is exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a possibility to buy with lifelong internet access as the Peek already offers in the USA.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my e-mails with the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to be able to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is without a doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already when Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him at his second most important moment in his life, without a doubt: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow - the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and she wore something large-shaped embroidered or a necklace.
It even went so far that it seemed at first sight that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric they are made of.
At the inauguration, she wore a lace dress and a patterned velvet dress in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: green shoes with semi-high heels for the first time and a changeable model for the second time, but golden.
Also the hairstyle was different every time: The hair was put up as a hair wreath on this occasion, the previous one she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study "Fruitability and career of women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged between 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market as limited due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to start a family and in the number of children, depending on whether women work or not and, if so, what kind of occupation they do.
Those of them who do not do any other work outside the house, work only half-day or have no fixed employment contract are more likely to be mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with fixed employment, especially in the public sector, postpone the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"Women in the 35-49 age group with a fixed job only receive their first child on average 3.7 years after moving together, a figure which increases to 4.1 years for women with a fixed job who have taken longer to achieve this and who have brought about their moving together and the first child much later.
In addition, the type of work has a great influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar on conceptional readiness," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they only have a primary or higher education, were, on average, mothers for the first time with 25.1 or 32.1 respectively.
There is also another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women with the main degree already get married and have their first child before their first permanent employment, the women with a middle or high school degree do exactly the other way around and first look for a permanent employment and get married after that and then get their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to his envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The leading actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will thus become another famous figurehead as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (spectator colleague of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion they had all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of this year.
The poker game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicente presents in "Poker of the Aces" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) to the three x-rays of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear-inspiring genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks an affinity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicente does not save on horrors or enlightenments.
Besides the fact that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual instinct, just as I have always felt, without having found words for it: joy in contrast to the unholy fate, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between fainting and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was cast into her spell by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted of coming to heaven on the detour of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8000 summits in the world literature, you have to climb up the north wall, on the wall where the best climbers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny guy.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a landowner of the county and again other times he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams bear witness to a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the insane cry that was screamed out from a bridge from that personality in Munich, so that his echo echoed deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary way. He made this on a journey on which he fled from himself and begged posterity with a speech full of violence before the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and begged: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I can finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spencer are engraved: 'the sleep after the effort,/ after the storm of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after a full life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband accepted it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying on her between the azaleas or the birds were singing in Greek.
There is no other case known where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent was much greater than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to instill Joyce in Baroja?
What, then, did Benet intend to do if he did not bring Baroiah to Faulkner’s weapons?
What was Cela doing, besides destroying the glory of that man, so that he could stand himself on this podium?"
Cowardly Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age ran beside her and our dog, our dog is a hybrid, which we took out of the shelter and weighs only six kilos, and then they gave him two kicks out of the blue and seriously injured him.
Our indignation cannot be put into words, because it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun should be with a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course carried out on a leash.
In addition, there is the suffocation that a woman who went for a leisurely walk got when she wanted to reprove these persons due to the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he may also do the same with a woman, a child, an older gentleman, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog cried all day long.
Of course, we have filed a complaint in a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether this will do anything at all and to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation at what happened led us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must happen in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among the younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of her commitment to road safety, which "includes far more than just the design and manufacture of products that are becoming more and more secure with each day", and further affirmed that, with other educational and informative actions, they also contribute to getting closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign for the promotion of helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will in a first phase distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, they are always committed to one of their main objectives being the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks is increasing again
After almost two years, the car market for vans finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in relation to 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase after 22 consecutive months, with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the manufacturer association Anfac and the car dealer association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are currently only available with great caution, as the reference data used for the comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly bad year of sale with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total registrations for these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures for the previous financial year.
A total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold since January, but this figure includes all the vehicles that make up the van market: derivatives of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter vans/carts.
Furthermore, there are still the same storm clouds in the sky, which most affect the demand, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, most of the sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100 % of all cases make the purchase with a third party financing.
For example, to these restrictions, which are the result of the banks' closed-off money tap, one has to include other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a car of the Plan 2000E has helped little.
However, this plan is not only for private individuals, but also for the self-employed and small businesses, if they want to buy a van up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday Ganvam recalled that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The Car Dealers Association predicts a similar year for 2010 to the previous one, for which it anticipates a sales loss (for passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock braking system and as it is now happening with the stability control ESP, the auxiliary systems for braking in emergency situations must become mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, and for the remaining vehicles a waiting period until the end of February 2011 has been set.
The aim of the measure adopted by the European Union is to improve the protection of pedestrians, but its operation can also help prevent many rear-end accidents.
The task of the emergency braking assist is to apply more pressure to the brakes in the event of a critical braking manoeuvre, which the system detects on the brake pedal based on the braking strength carried out by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers involved in an accident did not even get to step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system and thus reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during the braking process.
According to an EU study, every year up to 1,100 fatal accidents that cause damage to pedestrians could be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assist.
There would be even fewer accidents - one in four accidents is expected to be prevented with personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, the system will help him increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is inevitable, the brake assist exercises the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were already informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that it needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europe, wants to ensure that the parties concerned give their agreement on every single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM assures that it will make a decision regarding the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports car, which has the backing of the Russian group Converg, is gaining more and more support.
In the absence of an agreement with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, which now only weighs 1,275 kilos.
In order to do this, they first dispensed with the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent-mounted roof with manual drive, thus saving 21 kilos alone; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model such as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by the removal of the air conditioning again 13; moreover, the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 liters, thus saving another 7 kilos; by the installation of sporty Bacquet seats again 12 and with the light 19-inch rims again five saved.
Then they had also achieved another six kilos less by renunciation of the CDR-30 audio system and the missing kilo by replacing the door handles by handles made of fabric.
Although it is also available with the PDK double clutch transmission, the test drive was carried out with a 6-speed manual transmission, mainly on the smaller highways of California, on mountain routes that were really very curvy.
With his driving behavior you can only give him the touch perfectly.
The reduction of his weight did not mean that he would no longer be so safe on the road.
It is rather the opposite: for a long time we have not tested such a small and light model, but at the same time it gives you a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles during a low gear in the required time, until we give him the orders to race, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again ...
He does everything he is told. The car does everything we suggest to him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 Boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and you can even increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used at the Panamera for the first time.
Acceleration is unimaginably brutal, whether standing out or accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the road where we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the potholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire track, even though we found ice at dawn and roll split in the morning on some of these curves.
To sum up, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pass, as it is usually rather rare and in it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bosom friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Cocoon cosmetic line and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same stiff neck as her bags of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many failed players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an outstanding triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra and thus comes to the first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight triples the best of his team (29 in the evaluation).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large amount of commitment and teamwork, even if they had to wait for their victory until the bitter end.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed decisively to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the blue-reds, who from the beginning took the lead on the scoreboard.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, one could already guess that they had come to the field with well-heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the team from Álava decided to play an inside game by Barac and the game of Eliyahu, which was received with whistles and applause on his return to the team, which is his home to extend their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of Splitter already suggests that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage during the break, the game was not decided yet and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that not everyone wins on their playing field, and thanks to the constantly attacking "Hand of Elías" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the fact that the "yellows" turned the rudder (50-49).
More Disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured, but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with accuracy to get air back and one of them suddenly got the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that the scoreboard showed a calming distance of (54-67), which the host at the end of the third quarter could beautify with (57-67).
The Alavesen were put out in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had honestly earned in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, the best of their team did not and tried to give their team strength again by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and even though Splitter was dropped off the grid due to fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended itself well and although the Israelis caught up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injury prevented Unicaja from being ostracized
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to give up the lead in the group B of the Euroliga to him, and this was in a game characterized by the failures by the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the inner game, which made the victory easier for the Greeks.
The team from Malaga was not afraid of the mood in the Hall of Peace and Friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their game in the first quarter, the Andalusians could start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the ereins Unicaja, even though the local team with an indoor match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to score 22-20 in their favor in the 13th minute, the minute when due to an action it almost came to a fight between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and therefore both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to warm up and its superiority on both sides of the game, while the departure of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-caused mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces in the Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and the Lithuanian foreman Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which despite its 19 losses proved superior and even managed to compensate for the difference in the game played in Malaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn made the lead within the group wavering.
Unicaja tried to ignore the many failures and departures of Scotsman Robert Archibald, who had been injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja in the 31st minute, thanks to the lead and the triple of Cook and the use of Lewis, some hope came back to 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, because the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, could not be braked.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to give up defeat and had to give up the lead toOlympiacos.
How much should you earn because of your profile on Facebook?
Thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, Facebook users can now experience their salary, which they should earn because of their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users can use a form on Facebook to enter their profession, work experience, age and the city in which they work.
Just a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish employee "feels poorly paid on average", explains the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, as opposed to the 24,000 euros earned by a Spaniard.
As a result, a truck driver has a net annual salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros net each year; followed by the work of a salesman with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President who has been removed from office must leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010 at the latest, when his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knew that before that date he had to leave the embassy in which he had found asylum since September 21st.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, as his mandate expires on that day and he has to find a new accommodation."
The station also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the scheduled date: "My point of view is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as the winner), Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he sought refuge in Brazil.
This failed, however, due to Zelaya's refusal to recognize the status of an asylum seeker, which the "de facto" government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the most tempting days since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned in the markets, which is not surprising in any case, as this is their natural state, in an environment where brokers are making decisions about a future that is inherently uncertain.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to leave liquidity free at zero interest rates so that banks would buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost finished and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are starting to spread some sand into the gear, as the BCE näc has already done with its annual auction, which is taking place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even if they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to nationalize the private risks and the public debt increased again.
The focus is now on quality and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred haven for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the eurozone countries in terms of Germany.
Spain has so far been hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision downwards regarding the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain degree of uncertainty does not harm to silence those defenders of moral risk who had once again tried to raise awareness among those responsible for global economic policy, for what they had caused, as they had slowed down the devastating effects of limiting credit to job losses when they were supposed to have decided a new day for thanking.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the Emirs in order to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was already foreseen earlier.
A government that hides the sovereign debt, elections and a new government that pulls in the same direction.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-fulfilment of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a euro member country to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to involve its citizens in the need for exceptional measures in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, as expected, we are ahead of an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some debauchery on too high amounts, that would now lie within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
If, however, European differences were to decrease and Spanish people were to increase further, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local early indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and correct their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which are once again coming up with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long service life despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, even though at the moment "be careful while driving" is announced.
Related branches
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear yesterday before Parliament's subcommittee, where the strategy on energy supply for Spain will be debated in the next two decades.
After his appearance, which was followed by Rafael Villaseca, president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Galán gave the press some key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, by 2020 Spain will have to invest 50 billion euros and a further 60 billion from that date until 2030, under the condition that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that it is no longer necessary to invest in increasing energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international networks.
From 2020, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to absorb carbon dioxide and, of course, in particular, renewable energies.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the condition, of course, by other "supporting energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft budget for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has called for, did not want to say anything about this law, such as creating incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, despite some "individual" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called them, this direction is clearly taken.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that decisions on investments should already be taken, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework will have to be created in order to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" from Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground airport services, Swissport Switzerland, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, for which no figures have yet been announced, will last for five years.
On the other hand, yesterday Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to study energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for his first highway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first highway in Australia, a market on which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction involved is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in Brisbane, Australia, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The municipality wants the construction completed at the end of 2014.
After the administration decided on a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) in order to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and the toll station administration.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly European construction companies, competing in the final phase.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second is based in Italy, one of the best civil engineering specialists.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure and the French Bouygues group, is competing against the Acciona team.
The third and final consortium, which is in the short term, is called LBRJV, made up of the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises massive construction and privatisation, but has a hurdle to overcome, as one can only gain access by buying a local construction company.
A strategy that the mentioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, have followed, and which still has to be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona places great importance on this geographical area for the sector, in which it is already well known because of its activity as energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage the Adelaide desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention now is to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The purpose of the underground toll line, which is supported by the Brisbane Infrastructure Office and is called Northern Link, is to connect the western highway in Toowong with the Kelvin Grove bypass (see map) over a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels. This is the largest way to reduce congestion on the Brisbane roads.
The timetable issued by the city administration provides for the award of summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll line is to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, construction work is expected to continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government is contributing 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to the financing.
For Hochtief Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia is repeatedly awarding substantial contracts to Hochtief, which signed a contract yesterday with the government totalling 154 million.
The subsidiary ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cable through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create fast Internet access for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the 27-storey construction project of the King George Tower in Brisbane, Australia. Construction work has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
Initial investment amounts to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its subsidiary Alpine, FCC has secured the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometres long for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it was awarded the contract for the construction of the extension of the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnelling.
Construction work is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and its implementation will last over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising budget from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore over a sum of approximately three million euros annually, the railway company informed.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected from among 16 agencies that presented sch to this competition advertised by Renfe, of which 4 came into the final round, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be commissioned with the design and production of the campaigns.
Punishment of 63 million for France Télécom because of the slowing down of the competition.
France Télécom has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France for anticompetitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the fringes of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, as the authority that oversees the competition is of the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore relapsed.
Use Trading
On the other hand, the French company’s subsidiary followed the example of other telephone providers and opened an application trading site on the Internet to increase revenue from transactions not resulting from the telephone connection.
In principle, this application website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 until this Siete will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
Since the start of the season, Madrid and Barça have earned 476.4 million in the Champions League.
The Champions League has developed since its creation in 1992 into a source of income for football clubs.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since won 476.4 million, giving them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have made the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning UEFA Champions League not only brings fame with it. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5,362.5 million euros to 105 teams (of which 12 are Spanish) who have participated in this event since it was founded in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is in third place in Europe, which has earned the most money through its participation and the only one besides the AC Milan that has won the trophy three times.
The current Catalan champion and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 took fifth place.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also received the most money by participating in the past Champoins League.
And even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that were able to obtain money through the Champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, as opposed to four bie Italy, three with England and two with Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure that UEFA is applying.
In this financial year, the organization, chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenue of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualifying preliminary round (among them the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who fought for participation received 3.8 million through their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400.000 per team). The clubs that have come to the eighth finals receive three million each; the four that have come to the quarter finals, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, compared to the second, who receives 5.2 million.
Thus a football club gets at least 7.1 million and at most 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça, on the other hand, earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are earmarked.
This money is distributed proportionally to the value of each television market.
The Spanish belongs to the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year's champion receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place, and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
Yesterday the Nueva Rumasa Group leaked details of the offer of shares to purchase a ceiling of 25 to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which will be paid out for ten years and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this postponement.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at EUR 1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz Group shall give shareholders a period of 15 days to notify their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV confirmed that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the Authority.
On completion, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to remain on the brink of possible offers of purchase and the legal squabbles of his ex-managers, the Jesús and Jaime Salazar brothers announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit.
A decision by which she becomes the first woman to hold a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created post, directly under the chairman of the Group.
This is anything but free from polemics because the company is involved in a court battle on suspicion of diversion of more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will postpone further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the Salazar loan, the ex-advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) came before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their purpose.
CNMV approves the public exclusion notice submitted by the investment company Mer of Paternina
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion notice submitted by the investment company Mer for Federico Paternina last October 9.
The supervisory authority stated that it had approved this invitation to tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions complied with the laws in force and that the content of the explanatory supplement submitted could therefore be considered "sufficient" following the amendments made last December 2.
CNMV has also indicated that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,08 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, which is 8.95 % of the capital of the company, consisting of EUR 6,142,786 in shares admitted to the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, it was also announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the closing of the tender and whose price was fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws in force.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of storms and accidents not only the car workshops earn
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed to the workshops, where an expert assesses the damage caused and the cost of the repair.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100 % of the experts use this type of system.
Service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from manufacturers in order to process them afterwards and to offer them to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American Solera group, is the market leader; 80% of all expert opinions are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing with the tool market for peer review and reporting are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, to the point that in the last five years even more versions, variants and motorisations have been introduced to the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car enters the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a laborious task, because each and every one of the thousand vehicle parts has to be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the process is proceeding rapidly.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle park on the roads, it is over 99%.
For the purpose of the documentation work and the production of databases, Audatex has eight distributed centres worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics specialists) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus to offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the price or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about a leader about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex offers this offer not in Spain, but in the United States.
When looking through the products Audatex offers, it is easy to get an overview of the kind of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, the star of which is AudaPlus, a standard solution for assessing accidents for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
Apart from the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid depending on the intended use, i.e. for each report.
It will be the most expensive for customers who rarely use it, maximum ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that produces thousands of expert reports negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly line, using the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is an open service on the Internet for the specialist market, with which you can offer for vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or obtaining information about the differences by brand and model.
It can be used, for example, to investigate how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes among other Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and delivers the same kind of digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT expert guide is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 reviewers and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased by 20% annually in the last three years and in 2008 sales amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they began to go on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is carried out in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Total revenues in the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) total 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of EUR 19.1 million, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Auctioning of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a flatfom on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and added value, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is exclusively aimed at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, reviewers, car rental companies, workshops, scrap yards and car dealers, who must register before doing their business.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the site has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
3,000 ads are managed every day and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been deregistered may no longer drive on the roads, but certain parts which have not been damaged may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars with historical value may be re-registered, even if they have been cancelled after difficult administrative procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives an estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creation and creation of an estimate.
The ease of use of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince the older specialists, who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of working hours, surcharges or discounts, and after that he can have the estimate printed out and passed on to his customer.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for evaluation like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
Currently, Audatex is working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that auto mechanics have been waiting for a long time, for example, since they can select a door and then turn the picture completely around to look at the inside.
