The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm a #PRS_ORG# major, so it's not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should add to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel and reorder the order for the better price or is there another option of credit?
In principle, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Let's take a look, let's help, let's bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be themselves enough child, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for a short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can see for yourself whether this fits your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and accompany K2 for hours of sleep.
Legally, it's probably questionable.
Maybe that's why the psychologist's statement comes.
Because if something really happened like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a thriller a few years ago and although I can still remember almost the whole story, the title partout doesn't want to come up with any more maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and therapy.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by pouring himself over with food and going into the enclosure to his predators.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation, falls to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is assigned anonymously before each suicide to go to the place of the suicide and document and place the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately the patients are afraid to face up to it in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out of the window another drives to death on purpose)
This face fear is described in the book as "the fight".
In the end, there's a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the rough story I am quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author.
If this plot is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, dear, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
I need to contact my husband first.
This may take some time.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference referred back ?
Child, 4 j., splinter under the thumb nail

Trying to pull it with a tweezer.
Very hard to grasp.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotive of track gauges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" loudspeaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multi-protocol decoder.
It controls the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 driving steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders register fully automatically at a suitable digital center.
It controls all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values on the main track can be read with suitable centrals.
For centers that can program only the CVs of 1-255 there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving steps at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the activation of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic login to mfx® compatible centers.
The LokSound 5 decoder detects the Märklin® brake lines as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Brakes with DCC brake modules or with DC voltage are also possible.
In addition, it also stops at a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC-train automatic allows automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC circuits.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to advance booster vaccination
New Omikron cases are getting politics and science in the UK.
All qualifying adults in England are therefore to receive a vaccination offer by the New Year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress with the Corona booster vaccinations in view of rapidly increasing Omikron numbers than previously intended.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said to his compatriots on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message.
To date, the target date has been at the end of January.
The British Government would also provide support to speed up vaccination campaigns in the areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, one is faced with an emergency, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, said Johnson.
The good news was that the level of protection could be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
"Get a boost now!" Johnson said.
On Sunday 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded by the purchase price at the time of collection?
I'm in favour of everyone introducing themselves to pronouns.
I sent out an application.
Today came the invitation to a conversation by e-mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not a "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I Googled him, and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can someone help me, please?
** I am a foreigner and I don't want to kick an official over my feet.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves to pronouns.
Got a total of five books on it.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work
Evidently, the chair had an obvious lack of sales.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Only tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
==References====External links==
14 days no more.
Therefore, I always bought the last books from the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge me that.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I'm going to write something detailed about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about the soul.
I (21) come more frequently into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims do not let themselves be helped or think we could not help them.
It is quite clear to me that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of tearing the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But this never makes it easier.
Please, remember, you're worth living without violence, that's so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the worth of the series on "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two season?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby-debacle of the MHP giants Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was dependable.
Again nothing: For the second time in less than three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the match, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim at the beginning of October with a look back at the trophy defeat: "We still have some anger in our stomach".
After the match, however, it did not settle - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
Even more so than the naked result disappointed the way of the performance.
A statistic that expresses the whole dilemma is called: The three-way ratio was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) at 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer was given by John Patrick: "We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife, and we didn't do what we trained."
It's moving the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "To win a great game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the lucky coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people before."
Only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they were at their expense.
Not least because of BBL-Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and steered the game of his team.
"The best gamemaker I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team even the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed all along the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already been 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there isn't much time to go into trouble.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
we used to have another mail address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I checked in a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We were legally informed again and wrote them back to us about it.
We were originally in touch half a year ago.
Always as if peeled out of the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Good day, good luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it won't happen.
The planned concert was moved to May 2022 - "on official instructions" to contain the Corona virus.
Other of his performances planned during the Advent season must also be cancelled, as it is called on the website of the singer, who is now 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to make up for their deadlines, which had already been laid in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot and enjoyed singing as a teenager.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the palace orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has received many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place on the charts, just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013).
He made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly combed back and considered etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer to think away from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, good luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

It still doesn't work I can only crave the cover sheet but can't scroll.
Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants certainty that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
A colourful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz did not rule out conversations with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rental right.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rental mirror.
I'm going to talk to the Minister of Justice to get this done as quickly as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step in the payment.

At least 100 dead by tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have moved through the US.
There could be more than 100 deaths in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there remind us of a war zone.
During the night on Saturday, several tornadoes in the United States have caused severe devastation and may have claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave behind an approximately 320-kilometer-long snag of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
His governor Andy Beshear said, after a visit to the disaster area, that wherever the tornado ran through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, with official figures rising every hour.
Hi, I just saw that she sold out showcase #NAME#.
That's too bad.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely taken out of the range?
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
When will you be in touch?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order !
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an Artike via the contact form or gave up a return and wanted to ask if this was received or processed, as I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees cash premiums for vaccination.
Thus, they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - according to the German model - is also intended to increase the readiness for Corona vaccinations.
He moved into a company he was blaspheming about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously did not sew himself in his old place and sought something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant.
I'm making a screen shot.

Help with first own campaign
Boron to the grunt!
For a group of 4 friends, I'm running the Adventure Over the Griffin Pass and I want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual file conceived and now I am writing the entry-level adventure and stumble already at the first encounter over my own feet.
The premiere is that the heroes are to bring a cart of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There the further action is to develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of Goblins are supposed to ambush the hero and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: Convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger at an early stage, whatever the players think of.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and sabres
If not noticed, the Goblins lurk the hero in a hollow path and flank to each three left and right arches armed to me the vehicle, while two with spears stop the vehicle.
If it comes to battle and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village school, a half-elf.
The cart's gone, of course.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the help of the hero in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much to enter the adventure?
The Goblins group will play a decisive role later, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will certainly take many of your ideas to heart and now have more confidence in my narratives.
I broke up the lamp again.
And put it back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd still like to send her back
If you can then let the return tickets come, then I can pack the lamp and take it to the #PRS_ORG#.

Is everything then picked up again or just the storage space part?
I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get some air with this post.
First of all, today in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was cancelled in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the schedule was far behind the schedule due to the delayed start and the start accident, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
But it seems that for legal reasons the F1 has to take precedence and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has finished the race.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then in the F1 there was again an ignorance of the rules with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that one can change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, they both came to the decision that Verstappen was allowed to change the tyres when there were corresponding radio messages on this subject to Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for verstappen.
I believe that such basic rules should be understood simply by commenting on the F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first guesswork, which is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the topic rules.
Generally speaking, Roos does not like the artificial comment style, but admits that the taste is a matter of taste.
But I really like Heiko Water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant absurdities, both of which simply make it seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (also unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest into the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising is simply overwhelming at Sky, in the final round Sky is the only channel that goes into the advertising, as you can listen to at F1TV because only the German soundtrack without comment has to get along directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do.
Also, these two stations do less advertising in the training than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Although Glock and Baumgartner must be praised for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repetitions.
All in all, Sky is really the worst German channel to broadcast the F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job in the four races, except for advertising.
So anyway, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
On this one: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The First Lady told me that it would be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them already showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for your support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via airlifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
See the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the benefits in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire systems with them.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable, so that you can connect several outflowers.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump can also be used to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find it in our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest to call shell or something like that.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated design and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an Auströmer or similar...and it can start.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and should be installed outside.
If the fan pump sits deeper than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent once water would run backwards that the water from the basin runs through the pump...
Should the fan pump be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify here in ebay the processing time with 3 days, so is packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent a little, so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be like that, not everyone understands all the employees who also work in the forwarding industry...of course, no Corona stops here.
Please do not judge equally badly, just because the delivery is delayed, that is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course, you like to scold these services, even if we say at the moment... they're having a hell of a hard time
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
how long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Can you order your legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers made a short trip into space.
On Saturday they were transported by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
Take-off and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the state of Texas.
Under bright blue skies, Bezos himself received the newly elected astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit when he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometres.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named after Blue Origin's rocket system, and 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan, were honorary guests of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not tell them how much they paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard on his assignments and do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would like to return to space immediately, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometres high
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during flight, reached a height of about 100 kilometres above the earth, sometimes with zero gravity, before the reusable object landed again with a brake from large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometres above Earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-out flight from Blue Origin: the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board himself, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second was the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as Captain Kirk in Star Trek, as well as former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing forward the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject rather exciting in itself and also standing in the laboratory does not bother me (already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I was already informed about career prospects before studying, but I also thought at the time that I would like to and will definitely study until graduation.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially with regard to my career prospects.
On the one hand (study check etc) you always hear great job opportunities and the job is totally wanted, on the other hand you hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly badly paid jobs.
That's why I'd really be interested in:
1) What are you working as right now?
2) Are you satisfied with your work / salary?
3) What did you study/what training did you do?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really insecure right now and maybe I'm thinking about quitting my studies in 2022 and getting an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have experiences, write them also like times :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's only now that a post is in it.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in the company.
As it seems, there is also the before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, the majority of people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So there was a long 4-day weekend in the house last week.
So what went on last week?
Stress everywhere.
A lot of e-mails that absolutely had to get out before the driveway, order here order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that can't be?
Or because people really want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed out on Wednesday, but I was also very annoyed.
What's this self-gage about holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we are not allowed to treat them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite self-sufficient.
My question is simple: are only we, the Swiss?
Is that our Reformed-evangelical kind?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no presents yet.
"The beautiful, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will prepare herself for the feast by baking and making cookies with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
But she still has a lot to do until the contemplative days: "For the first time I don't have any presents, I have to start now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth flow of the Mauser and the plumage formation.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of the damage to plumage caused by bird husbandry is due solely to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is required for the formation of a perfect plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Much of the animal losses that occur during the mouse are due to a lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids is explicitly considered and balanced in most plant feed.
No additional vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft feed.
Thank you so much, I found it.
Still not working
East German manual model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the remodeling proposal of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968, used with playing tracks and wrong parts see photos, function good, The series E 95 is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn Society (DRG), which has been designed for traction heavy coal whole trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are working
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to carry 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at 45 km/h cruising speed on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG designated the Siemens Schuckertwerke with the electrical part by supplying the mechanical part as 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with AEG drive.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and found themselves in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahn repair plant Dessau the reprocessing of all six locomotives was established.
[4] As the central German network was being electrified, there was an increasing demand for locomotives for the heavy freight train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were reworked in 1959, with the other machines being used as spare parts dispensers.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 in larger quantities were preferred.
It was only when it was foreseeable that the reprocessing number could not be further increased in the E 94 that the E 95 came to the focus of the reprocessing.
[4]The locomotives were first stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren Railway Works.
They came to the Halle P.
They were used in their own circulation plan mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal valley in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic with increasing age.
So it happened more often that shooters remained stuck during switching operations.
Then the attendant with hammer and wooden wedge on this locomotive had to release the shooter again during the journey.
Damages to the traction motors occurred more often and led to months of breakdowns in the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of the electrical operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn could dispense with old locomotives and most splinter types, so that the E 95 were put out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only once, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility of the cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were shut down in mid-1969, they were the last to be followed by the E 95 01, which quit service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system on the main station in Halle.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth maintaining as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive was first reworked outside with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] It has since been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is managed by the museum.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional Bw Halle P community have been working on the operational reprocessing of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time for an exhibition at the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior painting, with the transformers being checked and five traction motors operating.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian mountain railway and the branching off off-roads, where they proved themselves because of their reliable drive and the low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were converted to the Central German network in Leipzig.
The main application area was initially Silesia
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, function good, optical rework on the locomotive is necessary in own work, dusted in, with playing traces, cellar smell !!!, very rare manual model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may contain labels and traces of storage.
Yes the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet.Unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The middle bar does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I get new ones sent.
When will they be sent out?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones of the shape, they were only too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
The main purpose of these measures is to:
With me, they're not flat
Could I have these sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Home fire with two easily injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, estimated damage has occurred in the six-digit euro area, as reported by the police on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reported to have been hospitalized on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume deliberate firing.
The police officer Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the investigation.
But then she arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To defuse fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021
Biontech chief Uğur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
A friend's illness had caused him to do so, Şahin told him.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he receives vaccination against the coronavirus.
In the social media, there was false information that I had allegedly not been vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post in the network "LinkedIn" on Friday.
"For several months now, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me on which I am being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he had rejected this, because communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply sad when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a serious Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with Deutsche Welle circulates, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle himself clarified.
"I am currently not permitted by law to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time.
There was a prioritisation in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech boss has been vaccinated three times according to suitable data.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had paralysed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for about 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the lights went out on 41,000 affected residents in several communities.
The provider Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power units had been in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers of THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, Head of Primary Technology, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few days to complete, as the West Netz-Monteure could only temporarily restart some lines, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
The fire that broke out on Friday at 7.15 p.m., according to Westnetz, has severely damaged parts of the 10,000 volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There, elaborate cleaning and repair work were necessary.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level had been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday 6 p.m. more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth would have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually added from 9.30 p.m.
Since 11.15 p.m., the last affected by the failure would also have electricity.
More than 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were in operation.
After setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday noon, the authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is now important that citizens in their neighbourhood take care of elderly or single people and report to the local fire department units when help is needed," said District Councillor Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The main focus of the installation and operation of emergency power units was on the residents of old people's homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places were established in schools for those people who were unable to provide themselves or who require electricity-dependent medical equipment or who are dependent on medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay them in euros?
It is the day blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy
But I can't mount the underframe on the tabletop.
It is custom #NAME#.
There are three of them.
We wanted those with tabletops diameter of #NUMBERS#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push it into each other and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back, otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy to receive a feedback
Yeah, that's really easier!
That's how we do it!
Will you send me the return slip by e-mail?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Do you want me to do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that.

To ensure that the paint application becomes even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water of dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you put the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later not visible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke next to stroke.
A slight overlap of the paint layers ensures a uniform surface later.
Avoid wiping quickly back and forth with the brush.
This creates unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could go through later.
Metal tones and metallic colours come to the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal clasps can occur when mixed with normal colours.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you build them up.
The models achieve true-to-original appearance by means of the decals or decals.
From emblems on airplanes to ship names to trims and license plates for car models: the Decals give the model the finishing touch.
Attach the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still well to be reached.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or glued more easily before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a calm hand when glued on.
Cut out each decal required individually and arrange it for you.
Decals are also called water slide images, because you briefly moisten their back with water until the carrier paper gets dark through the wetness.
Then you push the picture only a small piece of paper and place the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you have previously moistened).
While holding the Decal on the model with a tool, pull the carrier paper off sideways.
Attention: Always check if the picture is right before you push it completely off the paper so that it does not stick to the finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Swallow excess water with a household towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look for something else then I don't have to read the book anymore and have to unsubscribe and log in and reload the book and look for the place where I have read.
ON Saturday I have already communicated with you.
Can I get it by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
Okay, thanks anyway!
I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But can I get that back without any problems?
Child care at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello, everybody.
we were in child care for some time, now when it comes to the settlement with the PKV, this suddenly goes across.
In turn:
We had applied for the Kinderwunschbahndlung in advance at the PKV and got the commitment over 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and did 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet calculate them with the PKV.
We again applied for the PKV to take over the costs and were granted another 3 further attempts.
After some further attempts (we have carried out more experiments than promised, logically calculate the most expensive ones with the PKV) we submitted the invoices with the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV only wants to refund 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second wish for children was a new insurance case.
However, according to the General Terms and Conditions, "the insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 trials will be refunded) or we (there are 5 trials to refund)?
* Would the PKV have had to point out to us in the pledges that with a birth the further attempts will expire?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here were to give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to get them back best
All right.
We won't order anything from them.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost good customers.
They are welcome to forward this to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague said to me that the repayment was initiated and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back.
I can't help it that the dresser arrives at me completely disturbed
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear that the repayment was initiated and I have still not received any repayment via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not gonna do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, I'm not able to get another kind of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget movies
What a low budget movie is exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What bothers you?
And what don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you very much.
Sincerely,
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll give up again soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
"Half victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can proclaim a "half victory" in conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU had not resolved the confrontation sustainably, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) explained.
This floating state - Belarus is not very small, but the EU feels that it is the winner - is probably going on for a while.
The handling of the people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
It appears that there is a "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not turning its back on it decisively, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion within the Union.
"It obviously cannot prevail if a Member State heads up to do its thing," as Poland is currently doing, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex to access the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, says Bossong: A principle agreement on asylum policy is being made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Re-attempt to cross borders
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested at night on Sunday and returned to the border, said a spokesman for the authority on Sunday.
In the incident near Czeremsza, the Polish officials were stoned by migrants.
According to the report, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
A total of 52 border guards registered attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of having lured her into Minsk with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania closed border sections according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to people's countries of origin to prevent their departures.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has put its market power in the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with harsh bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk also had to take internal political costs into account.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared to have the security apparatus regularly squeezing thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After Abu Dhabi's controversial Formula 1 finale, Mercedes filed an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken him illegally.
A second objection was filed against the evaluation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had raced to his first Formula One title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars driving before him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report to you again.
thanks for the support
Free entry for members: Europa-Park organizes SC-Freiburg-Fantag
The Europa-Park, named for the Europa-Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park informs, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau and members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coasters glowed red and white through the jerseys that day.
Foxes, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," says the park.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the cooperation between the Bundesliga and the amusement park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it was again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans who have fun together in the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the night sounds at her front door.
yesterday I gave up the contact form for the return of an article, but received no email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my question has been received.
It doesn't have everyone's time for your crazy chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you fix and not all of our household.
Contact Ms. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
That e-mail hasn't come yet.
The package would like to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
Sincerely,
The LokSound 5 decoder can play up to 10 channels simultaneously.
Each channel can be resolved with up to 16 bits / 31250 kHz and finally offers hi-fi quality on your system.
There is virtually no difference to the original audible.
A Class-D audio amplifier with up to 3W output power controls the loudspeakers, which can have between 4 Ohm and 32 Ohm impedance.
The huge 128 Mbit sound memory ensures sufficient capacity.
All single noises can be adjusted individually in the volume.
The superflexible sound engine without a rigid schedule allows the simulation of all conceivable rail vehicles.
Three separately adjustable brake functions and two alternative load scenarios give you maximum control over your vehicles.
Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Both of them won't admit it to their i.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it complete.
Yeah, wow, then you're just as little serious as Kollegah.
Those who seriously question evolution in principle are simply completely lost.
Because of me, a God has set the whole thing in motion.
But as soon as you're creative, you have to believe that Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just squandering nonsense.
And with that you are an enemy of science and not to take any more seriously like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal visual field, the magnifying glass should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass as far as the edge zone without any color errors.
Magnifying magnifiers are often marked with magnifying information.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your magnifying glass optimally, please follow the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - thus also with impact magnifiers - light reflexes are created.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
If the optimal conditions of use - magnifying glass close to the eye - are observed, reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
Further information can be found in the accompanying instructions for use (available in German and English).

#PRS_ORG# I will do very nice and good service, it took until you came to a person, you were great

I have already registered with you under the customer contact with the number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yeah, but it was before.

Tannenverkauf in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women look for the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some curious situation when selling firs.
Once, even without his partner, a man was said to have gone home because both of them couldn't agree.
Every year he plants about 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some curious situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas a little funny, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to have discussions here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And so both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "turner", which doesn't sound so tasty by far.
Problems with fiberglass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I have problems now to build a stable Wifi network.
Before that I had a DSL 50 Mbit connector and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit without any problems except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbits to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also arrives.
However, on the other DLan module, which sends out the Wifi, no longer the full 500 arrive, but the further I remove myself in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. using a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now on the first floor even slower than before (
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similarly large losses.
Could someone explain to me why with fiber, so much internet speed goes "lost" over the power line?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely expensive to install LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased to receive an answer.
When it is time to change the current account
Who would have thought that now would be quiet with the current accounts, sees itself wrong.
While many banks have used autumn to have their customers confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates are also falling further.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was seen as relatively generous for a long time with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she halved the allowance and even quartered it for the day's money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group's Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for day-to-day money accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, according to figures from the Verivox website, more than 100 banks now have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at EUR 25,000: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin even got right against this regulation.
Now it is already being discussed in the banks whether institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that even the upper authorities declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.
The table top was delivered for 8 people instead of those for 6 people.
The underframe is that for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She's officially at the top of Hollywood now.
But their lives are like a descent and descent.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who caused a stir in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
Their appearance is taken care of by an entire army of assistants, stylists and coaches.
After all, according to Aniston, she buys herself a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a ONLY chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of female and male fans fly towards her equally is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just unlucky with luck - and she's still looking for great love.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 went even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off the gloves and wiped the sweat off his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight gang contact, Räikkönen had to turn off his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finished his career in the motorsport king class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say good-bye.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and came on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich brings 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the doubles - Sport
The mark of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I did this once, I would have to win nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina in 2026," said the double Olympic champion from the BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two successes in two days at the Winterberg races.
First on Saturday, he resisted the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed the material setting and drove out a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he prevailed in front of the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier became third.
"We took greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22nd victory in series production.
Johannes Lochner, driving for Stuttgart, came to fifth place this time after second place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after fourth place in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do the same," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the third win of the season in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After only fourth place in the Monobob the previous day, she raced on Sunday at the German triple victory with the female pusher Deborah Levi for the World Cup victory.
Two-time Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded the first podium place this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig in third place.
For me it was super cool, first podium place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me with her.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and stressed: "It's not just pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka annoyed a little about the not quite error-free rides, but said: "It goes in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I just didn't get it and therefore I couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Through Corona, I had quite different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he had expired, which upsets me very much.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order again, as it is just reduced :)
Why is shipping only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No only when I type an extra field comes with the message
Was taken by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrong delivery.
But we want the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a lot of things I just want to write and maybe some of them - or some of them like that...
I am 24, I have KPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog does not scream or goes to kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (together since 6J) is sick, got a second degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because hand is in the dressing wg burn).
It's also cooled and we're seeing less (1-2x week) at the moment, which makes me very much in need of affection and love.
My dog child has a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was with the heat lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
It is now time to do housework, which we of course divide up.
But cooking yourself is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD disease is very well-adjusted, I am reasonably well-treated and manage.
Not good, but I can handle it and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is asking for a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have not done anything and the day after tomorrow anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and then what comes is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: only until the day after tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But then the whole thing goes on?
Just till the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holiday.
Only until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out right now that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I'm packing that ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do it any other way...
Is that how you feel?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't put that into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think this has a lot to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought that I'm sure there's a lot of sufferers here...
I certainly wish you a restful evening, the week is almost done!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, I'll get another color or what?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Two more times.
But she was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I found out at school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and that it is just another subject for them, such as math or geography.
For me, it was always a bit strange, perhaps because I was raised as a Christian and I always believed in it.
How do you feel about that?
You may also be able to tell about work and study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
Gives a curriculum, etc.
But would it just be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Keeping culture alive or something?
Hope you're asking is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Please write in English I understand that well
It's been a long time, then I'd stop
All right, thank you.
I expect a prompt response by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search Help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (born 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, modernism (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in more detail in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm in order to be able to live herself, I mean.
The crossing is also the graveyard of the soldier.
In the end, both soldiers fight against each other.
If that tells you anything, I'm grateful for any answer.
Our little girl was sleeping on her stomach from week one.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child like that can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything around it is right, no cuddly toys, go in more often and watch, but no minutes of surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Ahso and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, they've always had a blanket.
Watch your kid when he's asleep.
Is it turning your head aside?
Can it get up from the stomach?
Or is the face ahead Right in the mattress?
That's where you can tell if everything's all right.
We all grew up, too, and when my husband was born, it was a walk and would give you to put the kids on your stomach to sleep.
In addition, we are already "regular customer" with you and have already bought a lot of products
But then why do you offer me only 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the closet.
I'm asking you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not currently to be used.
To make it quite clear.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know for myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV, too.
But it's just that the politics of this station are now among the worst.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that you were an "independent" Internet channel.
Quote Arno: One wants to be "not a running litfass column".
What is it now?
An 0815 advertising channel that tries to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we still have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to offend people.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking in empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How are you supposed to like all this?
Great if you like it, I think it's awful.
I ask you to call back, because my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Corpus breach due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter in case of stomach ache or just for cuddling – my little friend of warmth can be used in many ways.
Cherry core cushions are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry cores can absorb heat very well and release it again dosed.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry core cushion with cover is suitable as a heat support only for the following application areas:
Before heating the pillow, check for atypical smell, stick or burn spots and dispose immediately if present.
Please take the inner cushion out of the cover to warm up!
Warm up in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (please note the microwave manufacturer's information!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the cushion by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion in the cover.
At the first warming, a slight moisture formation can occur on the surface, but it disappears during repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the heating instructions given, as longer periods or higher energy performances can lead to damage (inflammation and combustion risk!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is permitted in the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) at your arm bend!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish conditions, circulatory problems, fresh haematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.
For existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumours, as well as pregnancy, please contact a doctor before use.
If seams are opened and loose cores are released, discard the product and loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be checked regularly during use to rule out overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working from the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt, it doesn't work under the third coach.
Jubel in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover via interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so I should still work.
I thought power supply alone was enough for operation.
Failed, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start in spite of plugged in power supply.
As a result, I removed the battery, but nothing is happening here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network mode?
Is there anything else that's broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design!
20 litres of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stowed with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need in everyday objects remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2) the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it literally in it - with the Everyday Backpack series Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing access to the photo equipment within seconds.
This works with two possibilities: Once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in the Messenger Bags.
There is a metal closure hook in the shutter with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor beams, stable riveted, into which the hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is loaded, you just take the top bar, it's rather empty, a deeper one.
In addition, flap fasteners and hooks are magnetic.
This way, the backpack can also be reliably closed without snapping the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to dig through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday suitability of the backpack enormously: If you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday objects or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (see below for more details) and thus store both easily separated from each other - and access them independently through the two lateral openings.
You can also pull the backpack in front of the body from the right side, for example, to access the camera equipment in the main right compartment, while everyday things stay safe in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable straps help with this.
And since the outer cover of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I wait in vain for the emails from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday from confirmation for the assignment of
Contact announced by the forwarding company to pick up the wrongly delivered table.
So far, I haven't received a message.
I'm asking for immediate settlement.
I am already writing with the third support employee, with none of them I went further than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
This is the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#
It is to be expected when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like that is not an option for me...
It's working.
Thank you very much for your help
Have a nice evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, I will place a larger order right away, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And that the past year went differently than I thought I couldn't guess and just couldn't redeem and clarify it in time.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety in braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then machined mechanically (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific for certain discs and samples.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which depends on the characteristics of the original assembly with the balancing of the disc.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
In addition, created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, whereby the cuttings improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake blocks.
Aesthetic properties of our tuned discs underline the character of each car by their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing boulders in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread rapidly and triggered the so-called California Gold Rush from '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were staked, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You'll be looking for gold, recruiting workers, gathering horses and building companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You need to outdo your pioneer colleagues so you don't go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously select your actions, need to budget with your resources, and build a tableau that is more and more "working" for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays for a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), from 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the schedule where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers at the right locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables one half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then the players perform alternate actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning revolvers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the promoter turns to a new location and thus changes the available actions.
This goes on until the bidder has moved five times, so every location has been covered up once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players have to defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough revolvers and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score takes place.
The player with the most winning points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation showed up in my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
>The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he triggered a fierce debate about education.
Former patient: now both parents and guardians are making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourself, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and others in charge must never, never, never! be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is useful and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries discuss the elimination of testing requirements for triple immunities
At their next meeting, the health ministers of the Länder want to decide on a nationwide elimination of the test obligation for triple immunities.
"We countries quickly need clarity as to whether and from when the test obligation can be waived for three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, of the "Picture on Sunday".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinees is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Minister for Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that "he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on this matter as early as next Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back
How do I do it best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't do any more shopping through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Ups, an error occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I've updated account details.
What can be the reason for this?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 to 1000.
The most common is hearing noises/voices, less often seeing images and, most rarely, seeing pain.
Relevant for this topic: Cesar sections are operations associated with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anaesthesia is avoided for the protection of the child up to the navel.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during anaesthesia consultation.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment of mine describes Awareness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
I misread her comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ does not help us.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the broken chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We'll sell the second chair privately.
We're losing a lot of money.
I've already sent you an e-mail that you haven't answered.
Again, the question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know any person who can carry the heavy furniture to my first floor.
am I not being called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died 97 years old
He has distinguished himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There's the new book on the table, fresh as the press: "An old man is getting older".
The staggering diarium of a slow departure from the world led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I already testify here my thanks for life".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are europallets, standardised wooden pallets, which are used mainly in the European area as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported annually to Austria is not collected
New York brings MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the title for the first time in the Major League Soccer.
The Eastern Conference team won the final in penalty shootout with 4:2 in the first half of the season against Portland Timbers.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had won against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
That was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I have come to the taste and would like to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow, I'm going to set up a cattle fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I can handle it.
IES is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by e-mail on 18 January that the refund was made.
But to this day the money has not been received by me.
I'd like you to check that out.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people goose or duck belongs to the Christmas days like the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
Time's running out.
We'll tell you where you'll get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set both the desired level and the distortion content of your sounds.
In addition, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that can be used to reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" and distortion.
Further up it already sounded that with the POWER LEVEL-controller you can even make a power reserve fast, when things are going to be outrageously loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controllers, the full potential of the VT+ series can be exploited in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal attached here is processed with a box simulation, so that even when using a headphones or direct recordings you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 foot button, you can also conveniently access the sounds by foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and "tappen" the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But had seen it like this with others.
Is there any way you can send the lamp back?
Because she hangs too low for a dining table?
Well, I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we receive an update to the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If I can't, I'd be happy with a discount or a voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods I don't need are then something much.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting period has not paid off
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
According to Iranian figures, progress has been made in the negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are on the verge of reaching agreement on the issues that should be on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday at the Irna News Agency.
This was a "positive and important development" because at first there had not even been agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the revitalisation of the agreement were continued after a break of almost one week.
The negotiations will be attended by negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now state with highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
Thuringia was the only federal state to be located at the Corona-Inzidenz on Sunday above the 1000 mark.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always shown the highest incidence in Germany, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths associated with an infection were reported within a day.
200 patients with severe Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health services have been overloaded for weeks and hardly follow up with the registration of new cases.
I understand.
Since delivery is only at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print this out and stick it to the package and hand it over to the mail, that's it, right?
here I don't have to click/enter/fill anything else?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is an insolence in my eyes.
It's time for change
###MBundestag greet me, I am u/StratorDE in the Chamber in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
# What's the mail here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, you can see one thing: it is not extant.
We have come into a winter stare and have extended the summer hole to a few months.
#What's the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to dissatisfaction, as some things have happened here and as we are in general.
In the last few days the impression has become more and more apparent, that many here really still want to the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is in demand, which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a pile of shards.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to call on everyone once again to participate, only in this way this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange views and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How should the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we perform outwardly in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a few things, but that's not bad, so we end up with the discord.
If you want and have time, come to the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clunky for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day blanket #PRS_ORG#, is it also in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I'm asking you to make that happen now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will remove the cabinet as far as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can call me at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there any instructions for assembly?
How long would I have time to get them or to decide to return them?
How do you answer the question of why you're vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, at the moment also very rarely eats meat.
I myself was a vegetarian for a few years before.
When asked whether I always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thinking.
I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I ultimately also support animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that there was displeasure on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and thought she knew where her flesh came from and reduced animal suffering as a vegetarian.
Now I wonder if my answer to 'pump' was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you as a vegan are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without you putting it on it.
It greets a vegan who loves harmony (;
It is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Do not release your #PRS_ORG# from the legal requirements for distance sales.
I am at the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# does not pick up my returns on site.
Since I can't be there because of a funeral, I can't change that either.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date please.
From the 01.02.#NUMBER# I can be seen all the time again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz handed over a grant of 45,000 euros for the new equipment van Water Rescue to the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein to Lord Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein Town Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this process," says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment truck is used by the diving squadron Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein you can expect to see increasing operations in the long term: the boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, however, have synchronized, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I am a little frustrated because the whole action has taken me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, so be it.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection in June.
Can I enter an appointment during the ordering process?

First of all, thank you for standing up to the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar activity, that is, we were also arms carriers in the executive, I do not want to go any further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
Basically, however, one should say that, of course, the servant of the state comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
It should also be clear to everyone that, of course, in the special uniform and arms bearers, people on the right of conservatives should also be attracted magically, that these people can then of course be difficult to deal with the lived reality, because of course you have besides the average white, meanwhile many Germans with migrant background, women and also homosexuals (and by this I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine cliché gay, because in the executive there are rather less or not normal men and women who you don't notice if they don't tell you) and also can and must rely on these people, because in doubt they save your life or use it for you.
But even if it sounds strange in my experience, these marginal groups also represent a conservative attitude, i.e. are proud of Germany and feel rather less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly stands up for them or means having to make them right, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the right, because of course police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme rights there, but that they can openly say their opinion there or even openly forge any plans that are dangerous to the state is medially exaggerated and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers who were often in foreign assignments often begin to flatten out due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-minded people also meet who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, I believe that this is being fought well and that political education and education are also counteracting the whole thing!
Germany is so intertwined internationally and that is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yeah, which I don't understand, I ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBERS# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep notches filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More neatly by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am self-employed, very little free time), but my whole life I get it more bad than right to run my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything is left behind, and then and when it grabs me and I clean up and clean.
But it is never "that someone could come to visit spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) not better either, it bothers me somewhere but mostly household simply loses against work and lack of pleasure.
The kitchen is cleaned at the most regular since we like to cook.
Now to my question, did you manage to get better with your child?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it, and that's a question that's been bothering me for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visit comes and e.g. always fresh clothes is there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child or do you remain sloppy?
Looking forward to your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-confident personality disorder?
I have been training in software development and have been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, however, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time about starting again and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoiding) personality disorder (EVPS).
This means that I have no self-esteem and are therefore shy.
I don't have a problem talking to people on a factual level, but it's very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I've been told many times that I seem unapproachable (and I think that's already improved).
Can I become a social worker like that?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, addiction counselling or family assistance.
But I don't know if the day-to-day work is really the way I imagine it, and it's hard to find something on the Internet.
The AEVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there's something to complain about my code ("it's easy again") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do it myself by now"/"I keep him from working with my stupid questions"/"he must really consider me to be undermediated" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession but I wanted to have it mentioned at the moment.
But you've already got the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pick-up.
What do you mean, give back please!
If I downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message will not be published. Your #PRS_ORG# will not authorize this book.
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
In its gastrointestinal tract, the bird breaks down the protein (protein) absorbed by the food into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and builds up its own protein substances from them, which it also needs for the formation of plumage.
The formation of plumage in nestling and the formation of plumage in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and are particularly demanding for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply of NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be restored.

1 g NEKTON organic to 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
A coated measuring spoon (inside) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In case of severe plumage damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of the new plumage formation is visible.
The normal dose is then administered until the new plumage is fully complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That's really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to inform you that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this e-mail?
Statement by a municipal employee in opposition to the statutes
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So a case application was made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the fall of fruit trees and therefore also the walnut is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo with no use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
yes, that I think, only the question is yes, whether I can pay in euros and have the ceiling delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Rapid notification: serious road accident at Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on St 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
According to the police's press alarm at the moment (14:03), a car has come into the oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injuries.
Ah, okay, I get it.
Well, thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas on further working life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head destroys everything you can think of.
Before I pick up here now .. in short: I need advice and best of all from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm just doing the Ref as a lateral newcomer.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in an area (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I don't call anything more specific here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point, I ended up at the Magisterium and was sure that it was - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job advertisements".
And it's only been half a year.
When I painted before, I always decided to go on and at least finish the ref, after that I can still turn around.
But right now, I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time for the last month that I'm completely exhausted.
Now it's vacation, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my night off.
That's when I was free.
And the stress at work didn't matter at the moment.
Now the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there's those rigid structures that also bother me.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref is also running well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it shuts down completely - if it doesn't already.
I wonder if I would like to have the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or if I should not go back to the old area where I was valued, could take my free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but was properly paid and worked out together in a team and not as a single fighter like this most of the time.
But then I wonder if in a year I did not return to the same place as now and am dissatisfied.
You realize it's all kind of messed up, but maybe as outsiders you have some advice or ideas about how to get out of this situation that I'm completely done with and start crying at the very least thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably doesn't lead to anything good.
But perhaps your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas - that's enough for now.
Thank you for reading and excuse the whining undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its launch in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has evolved steadily, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the Valve Reactor circuit, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up-to-date in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply achieve the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only spring.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology, which was introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then in order to meet new sound requirements, which led to a further boost in the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two loudspeakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists will find a maximum variety of sound.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced reproduction of game dynamics and string stop as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that above all the final stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier equipped with a 12AX7 tube perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic loses at Clippers
The Orlando Magic defeat series in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven points by his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 on Saturday at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro dividers, it is tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for things that are not photo-friendly.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also the ideal choice for drone pilots, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the outbreak, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the well-known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
To date, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585, with 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still dared not predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Council of Islands, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV channel RTVE.
Millions of Damage
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick lava layer.
That corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
On the coast, two new headlands with a total area of about 50 hectares were formed by cold lava.
The banana production, which is immensely important for the island, was particularly severely affected, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was in crisis even before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely affected, the newspaper "El País" wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is at the door, and especially the children will not be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-building "social treaty of natural peoples", escapes the rigid routine and can be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas Became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the giving.
Previously, gifts were presented in one way or another on St. Nicholas' Day.
The background of this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into her window in one night to spare them another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving came the custom popular in Germany, to fill the boots especially of the children with gifts.
Protestants stumbled upon this custom because they reject mediators between God and people as "holy worship".
For these reasons, they are against the institution.
Martin Luther made St. Nicholas the Christian child and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift was shifting to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions as closely as they do, it is only a few who are angry that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period, similar to Martin's custom with Martinssingen and Martin's procession.
Today you will find everything your heart desires in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources show a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was postponed to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian lands, however, there is a cheerful Kuddelmuddel over the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christmas child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of Nicholas to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
This includes, for example, his white noise ebb, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh drawn by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana, who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost to some glory.
It's not reindeer here, it's three horses pulling his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christian child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who had gone to a bank with a gun and a bookie's business.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that could be stopped a little later by officials.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the crime scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the Kensington Palace area.
The palace is the official residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

Place the "lightstone" in any place illuminated by the sun on any day.
Two supplied soil skewers provide a firm hold if needed.
The matt white plastic cover itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides »Smart Stone« discreetly in its interior, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
At dawn, »Smart Stone« starts to shine automatically; in what color, you decide for yourself: Six attractive light colours are your choice – besides daylight white.
The switch off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery load level has dropped to a specified minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts from scratch the next day.

Pill problem
Hello dear women's people,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: About five years ago, I started taking the pill again, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and crappy PMS before the period.
Now I'd like to leave that behind, because I have to take enough medication due to chronic diseases that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten explosive pimples from 0 to 100 during my last two-year break and these everywhere.
That's so superficial, but it's got a lot of strain on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years of pause, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid that this time.
Perfume-free and without a mouth, my cosmetics are already, but maybe there's what someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, gynecologist didn't take me so seriously and dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, dear skin is such a thing.
Had pre-Bubertär severe neurodermatitis, then a time rest, then large-scale nodular lichen and the acne theme.
Food I also tried everything possible in the course of chr. illness and I got stuck on a sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed food, because nothing else worked so well.
It can also be good that hormonally is simply the worm in it, but if you like me have everywhere construction site you just don't want to go looking for more what else goes wrong.
I've already had everything from her colleague, Semina or the like.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I always have to work and get to the phone, and all of a sudden, everything was gone...
what is there to check, if the money were there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong

110 kV earth cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high voltage cable at Tann is final.
The plan decision of the government of Lower Bavaria opens the way for construction, which is to begin in 2022.
The system operator Bayernwerk now announced this.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts with us.
The blue bet number:#PRS_ORG# with the consignment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Not possible to deliver".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next process is?
Have a nice start to the week!
You can forget that, I explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a chest of drawers made of glass and the entire sides are burst, so the glass is everywhere and the cardboard is broken
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the dresser cannot be picked up because no one can enter my apartment
Thanks for the message
but why only EUR 20?

No, it is with all books, therefore the request at #PRS_ORG#, since it is probably a general problem
Ref: Planning classes (EK)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the ref since summer, teaching is fun for me, but I still have big problems planning my lessons in geography time-efficiently at the moment.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
In the school I can also only copy b/w free of charge (which is annoying for Earth science).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours at the moment.
For example, we are currently doing the subject of geofactors and I actually stand for myself every hour.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to spend too much time on simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how to build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I'd really like that.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the #NUMBER# order.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to do the returns as soon as possible.
Trade fears about the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed to do so.
Trade considers this to be unnecessary and complains of a drop in sales.
He also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for retailers.
In the case of transactions with non-daily items, sales were downgraded, HDE's chief managing director Stefan Genth criticized.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should be the positive highlight of the year is often a hole without floor," Genth said.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions thus lost just under a third of their pre-crisis revenues during the past week.
It only works well in the food retail and online sector.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
"2G shopping won't get us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of personnel input.
The ribbon regulation had to be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer had to be checked only once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops with the received ribbon on that day.
In addition, as in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) in the retail sector, sampling checks should be sufficient.
Real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping malls, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre-corona level, the sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of such important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high staff and administrative burden, the Centers are trying to find and get approved solutions.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors can, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central location in the center and afterwards - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also a mistake, which was tried to be covered with a yellow filler.
This looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back in the package and glued it.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the adjustment of the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on both the film set and the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the lamp in TV studios or when the lamp is mounted in hard-to-reach locations.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, one of the memory keys is simply occupied and finished by longer pressing.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that the known situation stands again with new turn on - Very convenient for studio work if e.g. the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - a battery tester is installed with it - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right one on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlight continuously with power via the supplied power supply.
The structure of the headlamp is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for mounting, so you can directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination shall be reliably adjusted by means of locking devices on both sides.
Care has been taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included.
Great is that in the delivery also a bag is included.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might still want to buy without any problems.
Too bad I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, Hessen, which had not yet won the series twice, was supposedly on its way to the next Bundesliga break.
But then the SGE turned up, within a good hour shot the frustration over a mixed-up start of the season from the soul and won furiously with 5:2. "It's madness what the guys did today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and uttered a "pauschal praise, to every single one who was there."
At the beginning, it looked like a further damper for the now ninth place in Frankfurt still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkusen with 2-0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Even defenseman Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the field for the first time since the fourth day of the match and his muscle injury, stressed the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result, especially for the audience.
That was the party we were going to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but also sees itself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professional.
Now one wants to "continue step by step and remain modest" and to carry out the tasks "at this level" by the turn of the year.
Next on Wednesday in the course of the English week is a away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 o'clock, Sky) on the program.
I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and reroute it, not a chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money has been transferred back and place the order again?
Unfortunately, it would mean that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for handball women before quarter-finals against Spain
Germany's handball women crept from the parquet after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty eyes.
At the end of the World Cup round, the DHB selection at 16:32 (8:13) won a fierce defeat in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to fight host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were far too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said Federal coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a pity we couldn't take the flow with us.
This was a bad game of everyone we have to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for entry into the semi-finals, a significant increase must be made against the World Cup second of 2019 next Tuesday in order to keep alive the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German thrower in a duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in the attack nor in the defense," admitted back-room player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look ahead quickly now."
Not at the height from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on the high with the kick-off.
Misshoots and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 residue after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter kick.
However, this was not the intended initial ignition.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes the German women could hardly put themselves in the limelight - and if they did, they mostly failed due to the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women.
So the match had run early at the 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backroom player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
However, she is allowed to play again in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get a little better into the game and until the break at least five goals.
The anyway only quiet hope for a catch up after the change was already after seven minutes at the 9:19 there.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-disposed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer pick up on an increase in performance and went off the grid as a clear loser.

The title is given, I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (to date only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to a large extent finished, it then goes partly on in vaccination centers for me.
I like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, if they are not related to you personally (e.g. "I take drug X, this is compatible with vaccination..").
My area of responsibility includes the information for vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to coronaimpfveverordnung and no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutic-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, who are not able to carry out vaccinations (may?), so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a "Huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television program "We in Bavaria" has been given a lot of thought.
However, unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained untried by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't a "person who's nervous."
And no one "who has to go fast."
That, the people heard from the TV presenter, is completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg reported the solution and thus probably caused many Upper Palatinates to be amazed.
"The Huiderer," the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialectologist Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more familiar dialect word "Houdern".
Which closed an educational gap - probably also with many who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books in two weeks.

I restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Tyre choice on the road bike- really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy because I wanted to train at least a little to prepare my bike tour next week.
Said, done and I drove my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then that happened, which lurks in every city center (this time: thanks Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to take the rest of the track anymore.
Because I didn't have a real chance to get a spare coat and a spare hose due to the weekday, I had to turn around again with a half bad mood and take the first train home.
Was then not quite that bad, maybe it is also better, if I practice again before the bike tour with the tyre change.
But now I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days in front of me, I would be very reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because also the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike to 14h 120km torn off!) and who had already called it suboptimal, because he drove with them for several years on roll.
But if I remember that I have to change tyres after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I got into conversation with an older man at the platform, who wondered why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these should be unflattering.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so impaputable?
I don't want to spend 40€/tires now, just to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I have 25x622 on the road bike right now.
Although there are also (apparently?) at the Marathon Plus tyres, the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me on other tyres on a road bike?
The Schwalbe side seems to me absolute! Lay knowledge rather to recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and greetings!

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get new generation again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and reminds visually of the big role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitable designed foot directly to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
Due to the principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather minor role, but in terms of sound an exceptionally high level is to be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to produce such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it is remarkably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal was tuned to the SOLO 15 with a slight high-pitch rise.
This is common for widebands in order to optimize the greatly increasing bundling of too high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the tweeter range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the positioning of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and astonishingly precise.
The reference-suspected extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a fine dynamic that seeks its same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and battery rates.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to start by thinking about the final optics of the speaker in order to include corresponding changes in the construction.
If one wants to veneer e.g. the housings, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer applies material again.
After all plates have been cut (e.g. in the hardware store), one should first drill an 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the appropriate place, in order to be able to carry out the cable there later without any problems.
With the help of a top milling machine, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used flush later.
On the rear side, this opening should be provided with a 45° chassis to make the opening surface of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four bolting points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail Fase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
On these the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are glued.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in the thickness of the material if necessary, if you would like to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
The fitting of the openings of the bass reflex tube as well as the connection terminal on the rear wall is facilitated by a suitable hole circular saw or a Forster drill.
Then a round cutter is used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top of the foot plate can also be rounded off.
Afterwards, the base plate is firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wooden screws.
It follows the drawing and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the bolting points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (sucking out / blowing out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is by the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
Push the entire and unabridged cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the foot up to the terminal opening and let it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable leads to the speaker opening and lets it hang out there also loosely.
The crossover is prepared and used below.
The construction plan of the crossover as well as the corresponding connection plan can be taken from the following document: Installation instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box follows, which is not yet completely closed.
Due to the 35 mm bassreflex opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and close it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp it is possible to check the sealing accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus cable (marked cable) has to be soldered at the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to everyone,
> finally we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> For known reasons it is unfortunately not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-termity of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the line so that we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic – yet we'll give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Get cold drinks, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
