Food to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation measured in the euro area is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 euro-zone countries, inflation was higher than expected in November - an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent was recorded after 2.6 per cent in October, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
According to Bloomberg, official forecasts are only 3 percent.
Unlike the American, British, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the leitzsins. In its discretion, the reduction in interest rates would favour the rise in commodity prices and the slight fall in unemployment to the emergence of an inflation spiral.
The ECB strives to keep inflation below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in a dilemma: inflation must be "agreed" in order to exclude the need for action later on.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in Germany reached a twelve-year record high in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The rise in euro-zone inflation was driven by the rise in food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat quotations rose by 88 percent, and the price of soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in prices for edible oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world price of crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent in 2008, but is expected to decline to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months analysts expect a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup is facing a government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has had the largest base camp, while the support for the socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
Among party-faithful voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two thirds (71 percent) are opposed to one fifth (20 percent) of support for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: they come to two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low point, the general economic mood has worsened further - never before has the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be "speakably bad" been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it "quite bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, the families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects the situation to deteriorate further; only one tenth is expected to improve.
A Gallup survey conducted in December showed that 71% of respondents - a historic high - rated the Prime Minister's work as "rather bad than right".
Thirteen percent of respondents have great trust or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of the party leader of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of those who think that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be managed without a change of government.
After the riots last October, 35% of the votes were in favour of the government and the head of government, but today this figure is only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate "with security" and another 20% would vote "probably".
By way of comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the polls "with certainty" and another 15 percent would consider their participation "probably". In view of these tendencies, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against hospital daily allowance.
Put on the group of those who took part in the referendum "with security" the proportions of opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would be even 81, 84, and 89 percent respectively.
Also most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trading area continued to maintain the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" again increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of over 1,000 HUF were registered in all hypermarkets.
After the prices in the food markets were "galopped" last December, the inflation rate did not fall drastically, compared to the already high, earlier level.
However, it certainly deters consumers that what they had paid well below 9,000 HUF last year is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magic 10,000-HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets examined.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year's level, while the prices for turkey breast fillets, nut and poppy poppy rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but for Auchan there were 1kg of cakes of bread for 139 forints.
There was no competitive fall in the price of the product to below 200 forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two litre Coca-Cola Pfandflasche of under 200 Forint, so the drink including Pfand cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, in this year's "Napi" shopping cart comparison, Auchan was the most expensive, and Cora was the cheapest.
Our calculations show that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart by 15 compared to the Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have increased each by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of the previous year and the most expensive one of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping basket of the last year and the most expensive one of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480,00 HUF.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1,206.00 Forint, but the VAT increase was noticeable in the prices at last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that has hit trade badly: it seems that department stores were not able to decide which price range they should apply to the individual articles, as the impact of the price increase on consumer behaviour was unforeseeable.
(If the trader fails to plan the speed of circulation of a product, he may lose substantial profits in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart fell so radically last year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost about 1,630.00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284.00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase; the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic food products, the Statistical Office found a price increase of more than 30 per cent over a period of 12 months.
So in addition to flour also for eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the product, which was already expensive in the previous year, has risen by hardly more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers - after all, they were able to pass the drastic price increase on to the multinationals.
In the golden trade triangle, hypermarkets do not complain; good years are constantly reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at prices.
It is bought from all large quantities, durable foods go in pallets over the counters.
Wednesday morning in the morning there were endless queues at the cash desk in all three department stores, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multinationals complain to opinion researchers that they cannot even achieve the planned turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
This year more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to improper use of antibiotics.
Hygiene conditions in hospitals, overcrowding of beds, overloading of staff - all factors that are not conducive to the containment of infections, according to the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
The traumatology department of János Hospital recently diagnosed MRSA infection.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured person in a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with a MRSA infection. Since then, an important operation could not be performed due to the bacterium, which is still in the patient’s body.
Until 10 December this year, infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System from hospitals in 1094, according to Karolina Böröcz, head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were registered in hospitals with certainty, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of people in their noses without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the drugs are dosed too high or used improperly, the well-responding bacteria result in antibiotic-resistant bacteria that spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with a weakened or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in older, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause severe infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of everyday sick home life.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, warned Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA there is only where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nurses wear rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment," says Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are being examined for MRSA when they are admitted to the hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be preventable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for curbing the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and old people's homes, hospitals should examine the patients in the hospital and immediately isolate MRSA infected patients.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not so common.
Not least because there are no subsidies from the state health insurance fund for this investigation.
Most cases would therefore only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology centre.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but this directive is not always adhered to by hospitals.
According to Karolina Böröcz, microbiological sampling is even more rare among outpatients or patients in primary care.
Saved by disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transferred from one patient to the other by nursing staff.
It is precisely for this reason that hand washing or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient in the local hospitals.
The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds narrowly lined up, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz points out, unfortunately, in the less financially well-placed hospitals it even happens that disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that actually favour the emergence of infections.
Such infections have been shown to be far less common there, or can be prevented from spreading the pathogen where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes enormous costs to health insurance companies, so they are being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government programme.
After initial signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has identified the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Death Lover Policeman Was Not Drunk
In the case of the car accident with fatal outcome caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official report is now available.
The now resigned police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholized nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman of the Budapest Supreme Prosecutor's Office on Friday, after the official report on the case was submitted.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he took the wheel.
The former police chief took his own car to Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII district and ran over a 55-year-old man who crossed the street at an unmarked location.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebars have, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, rank.)
The pedestrian died after being admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handlebar suffered a shock, then withdrew its functions and requested retirement.
The Budapest Procuratorate has initiated its investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
A further EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements in Budapest on Friday with a total value of EUR 400 million to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund.The loan agreement for EUR 100 million has already been signed earlier and the current agreement deals with the use of the EUR 200 million granted.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be spent on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has allocated a total of EUR 300 million to Hungary for this purpose and the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be channelled into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the subway line 4 was also mentioned.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of the underground financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest is EURIBOR-linked, the loan is provided by the EIB with a deferral of 8 years, without commission.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe looks attentively at the former rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who still buys the cheapest market in the EU, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most sought-after roadblock for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa regions are among the most popular, along the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are increasingly in demand.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country will also attract investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favorable area of Russe has more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - trade and office space offer highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfers' paradises, and thus to attract tourists in addition to the summer and winter season as well in the other two seasons.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already buying in on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who purchase real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down will either buy revitalized properties for 50-100,000 euros, or run-down houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they will then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are important, but the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are also crucial for buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of businessmen who invest in order to increase medium to long-term value.
However, real estate in the capital is constantly becoming more expensive due to the ever-growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are lowest in Bulgaria, but there has been an annual increase of 21 percent over the past five years.
The price increase in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the emission-reducing measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol expires.
There is currently a fierce debate between developed and developing countries.
The US has already signaled that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but they would be prepared to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether the developed countries are prepared to support developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on support for developing countries has also been reached.
The adjustment fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, probably at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be seen in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's six percent
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (as measured by 1990 values), regardless of whether the "Agreement after 2012" was successful or not. The Union would even be prepared to commit itself to a 30% reduction if other major industrialised countries in the world, or developing countries, are also prepared to fulfil their commitments to the fullest extent possible and responsibly.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the goal of the countries that had joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU, with its 15 member states at the time, had already committed itself to a reduction of 8%.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a target that the country will certainly meet, as can be seen in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The deployment is high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not enter into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction plans set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a renewed international emission reduction system, the importance of which was also underlined by the IPCC, the international scientific climate change committee of the UN, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in its recent report.
This would delay emissions reduction and increase the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C would be unavoidable, which would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
British army advertises on YouTube
British Army units have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special Forces stationed in Afghanistan have been downloading videos of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The images shot with miniature cameras mounted on helmets are controlled at the Kandahar Air Force base and then sent to London, where they are posted on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Soldiers of the Luftwaffe have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Department of Defense was registered under Defenceheadquarters in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but the British Department of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peacekeeping Forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq also have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the Luftwaffe published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of the foreign operations.
According to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie of the BBC, propaganda published in this way is almost free of charge, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
American advertise with game
But the army also has to fight against amateur recordings, which, in addition to the carefully edited, censored recordings, also make it into the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are discussed at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, numerous videos of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been uploaded to the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "genus" for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "Americas Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less life-scattered simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is by no means squeaky: instead of a Christmas party, she organises a working conference where her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsch.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure up Christmas mood with raffle or push into the officials' hearts.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - that's how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already captured the offices.
The largest Christmas party of a ministry is held this year in the Defense Department, but the employees of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas Celebration of the Orphans" children are given gifts by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission Celebration" family members are entertained by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFC) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport beat the strands.
The 4,32 million Forint Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be held in the House of Tomorrow, with some 350 of the 600 employees expected.
The main focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a raffle raffle.
The National Agency for Development (NFC) held its 4.7 million Forint Christmas party on Wednesday at the House of the State Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a banquet.
The room rental amounted to 1 million Forint, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas party organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
The building of the "Vígszínház" was rented for the celebration.
MAG Zrt did not confirm this information because we did not reach the responsible parties.
What's with the suit?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas party on December 7th.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
On request of [origo], they said: There was no ball gown or suit duty at the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Self-Government are preparing for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees in its own four walls for around 400,000 Forints.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party, but to the conference at the end of the year.
One expects about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are only entertained with coffee and Pogatsche, so the celebration goes out with 350,000 Forint.
Self-government minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply toast in the auditorium of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas party in its own festival hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured at 2,500 forints per capita - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent kicking.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, PM employees celebrate in this way every year.
However, there will be no real party mood - not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year's reception on January 20th, and the Ministry's Christmas party is cancelled this time.
One hundred guests are asked to visit Vajdahunyad Castle in the Municipal Park ("Városliget"; according to the department, the expenses are 1,000 forints per guest.
As reported by the Press Department, it will be a very simple stand-up reception to which foreign diplomats accredited only in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions held each year traditionally begin with a brief speech by the Minister and end with a restrained chat.
As the relevant press offices report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Education.
Asked about the costs of the Christmas party, no information could be given at the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration held at the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
On Friday, the League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form their coordinating committee for the indefinite strike starting on Monday.
On Saturday, a major protest meeting will be held, and on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the stoppage of work will begin.
Strike-related, significant traffic obstructions are expected, as rail transport is almost completely stopped, and Budapest's public transport companies (BKV) are also on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the Monday strike will be announced by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large-scale protest meeting will be held, and on Monday, all organizations that have joined the strike will cease work indefinitely unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike, which began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act, was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the unions immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the strike committees will meet to discuss further action.
On the basis of the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that there will be a vote on the Health Insurance Act only in the late evening hours, or even at midnight.
The strikes starting on Monday will have to be expected to cause considerable traffic disruptions: the railway workers lay down their work for an indefinite period of time, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies will stop.
At the same time, there will be motorway blocks in many places in one direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, while others are planning a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement was reached between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Union of Railway Workers VDSZSZ on sufficient services, even though more and more people are travelling by train just around Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV is on strike from the start of operations until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the LIGA power and heat energy unions are putting down work for four hours, and the teachers' union, bwz. the Democratic Teachers' Union, have called for 2- or 2-8 hour strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on an alternating strike nationwide at various times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SCEF, the forum for trade union cooperation, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraws the draft health insurance reform and presents a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Claim number three states that the eligible occupational groups will be allowed access to the early retirement scheme before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, a member of the League of Trade Unions, did not accept the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport concerning the secondary lines and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
Among other things, the Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states that in the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "enhancement of the existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsies and non-Gypsy populations in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provoking such an argument, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary conflict".
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent confrontations.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the local and foreign media, "have seriously damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember that since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been on the upswing, so that since summer 2007 several organizations called "National Self-Defense Association" have been founded.
"These groups are common to each of them to define themselves as a civil organisation, while openly boasting that they are preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defence tasks (catastrophe protection, national defence, order protection), relying on the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further: All this should be done in accordance with the method that tries to disguise various political aspirations as bourgeois initiatives based on the political and party displeasure of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association are therefore not merely intended to circumvent legal hurdles that might arise in the course of registration at the court - it is also a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, as some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as confirming its own anti-Hungary policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - it said.
From the point of view of the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central-Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was founded in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard stood the Roma mass riots that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents as a starting point for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organization is "national protection".
In her opinion, a real "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria has been noticeable in the last 17 years, but the state remained inactive and indifferent - so political capital.
Furthermore, the initiative would have launched a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflicts is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced that they will set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
As the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma are also responding to the threats by organising their own protection, according to the Political Capital Risk Alert Report.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news office: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annually, risk analysis reports would be published and, if risk-changing trends are apparent, public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the release of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere
In Hungary, holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of redistributing the working days around the holidays has become established, but the coming year will bring us less such days.
In the EU and in America, too, there is something else called "Feiertag".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and days off work.
Days off work are mostly church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year's Eve: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are working days - the latter alone so that the New Year's Eve celebrations can rest.
All year round we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are March 15, which commemorates the Revolution of 1848, and October 23, the Memorial Day of the Revolution of 1956.
On 20 August the foundation of the state will be celebrated, on 1 May the work will be celebrated, on 1 and 2 November we will commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "shifting work days" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work on the Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be finally processed, has been laid down by the Minister of Labour in a separate regulation for many years.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, public employees and civil servants alike.
Excluded are only companies and institutions in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on the holidays.
This year, only the holidays at the end of the year will confuse the working order somewhat: from 24 December, life in this country will be formally stopped, since most people take time compensation for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the holiday that has been reserved for this purpose.
Next year, there will be more holidays in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so that there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day so that Friday 2 May can be a rest day.
The second rescheduling is related to the holiday on October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th, Friday, October 24th will have to be worked out in advance.
The end of the year, however, will be completely marked by the holidays, after everything has fallen and stopped from December 24th, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six daunting little things to annoy workmates
E-mails that we forget to send, language messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: they bring "color" into everyday life at the workplace.
The question is simply whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or if you better face the challenge and try to consciously avoid them for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called" - says a colleague.
That it missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make up for it by perhaps calling the marketing department and confessing with regret that you forgot to align the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, it's all over with an apology.
Before getting involved in embarrassing excuses, consider what really makes your colleagues uncomfortable and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's hardly anything more annoying than grabbing a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the notebook was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without asking questions, we should not borrow anything from our colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find that something has gone away.
So don't put envelopes or post-it from the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: no more there if you really need it.
Talking about colleagues' private lives?
There is no effective means of stopping a gossip that has already been born.
Who did what with who?
Where and why?
If possible, you should not tie the information (or guesses) about the private life of your colleagues to everyone's nose!
And if someone opens up and reveals his innermost secret, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to remain silent like a grave, rather than to direct the one who is not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick for no reason?
If you call in the office to report ill with reference to agonizing headaches, because you feel uncomfortable right now, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, unstoppable executions, projects with fixed appointments now have to be done by your colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't play bad with your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you won't be able to get into the office the next day, or that something could come in between, so you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Sum, giggling, phone calls
One is very much in the way of his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud giggling of his colleagues?
Is there an unwanted telephone conversation you shouldn't have heard?
One should not annoy colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (which one leads over their heads), taunting, constantly scolding or nagging.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not exactly deepened in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Is it always the others' fault?
If a project is not completed on time, one has forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, one should not look for the guilt of one's own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the noisy colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake or how to make up for what is missing is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training pants and slaps: Comfortable for home, but has nothing lost in the office!
Not even then should one dress so casually, if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just don't get sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress accordingly in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
To make it right for everyone - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
The tempo changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar that sounds on mr2.
The local music scene has not spoiled us with quality electropop for a long time.
But now you even see the traffic differently when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the local digital underground scene, slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock with its guitar squeak is "in" again, the local electropop proves: There is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, playing music himself in the band Yonderboi, before he started his own way - perhaps because a tavern can't handle two pipers.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which fuses elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, was only achieved when one had approached him with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the Top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, became the almost only trendsetter that could also be marketable in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they would like to wear this brand.
The band reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new paths for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The term comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be fine, but apart from the ethereal character of the music, the pure guitar, the influences of rock'n'roll - corresponding to the zeitgeist and the trends - stand out.
With these songs the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", introduced himself at the premiere in the Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio hit - the mr2 Petőfi, who has been broadcasting pop music from early to late since the very latest, has gradually made the listener's attention with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything's all right, then (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "shift music" does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but also they can only be produced for the sale that makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The listener's willingness to record also works according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign countries, especially to the west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers or Twens going to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that are happening around them much more attentively, because they also consider it a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
We do not create music to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually noticeable at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but these in turn exist only in the incomprehensible changes of the moment.
Still, I noticed that if you want to make it right for everyone, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on the road as a soloist and has built his career more in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go his way, not to mention that we try to interpret this into our music time and again.
We see ourselves as team players who rely on each other's musical presence and let them unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening consciously staged with a somewhat more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We didn't have any plans to write a hit, which should then be used as a draw horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of putting together the choir of talented soloists from the local music scene.
This is how the six-member choir was created - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized apater "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song the same way, or did the girls shape it?
B. Zs.: The number has been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was ready, we thought that this number still "needs something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a vocal voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came practically right at the start and frighteningly spontaneous.
I can remember, I was quite electrified at the time, but it was already necessary for the "divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role of their own, sing together completely and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also on stage in the back.
Is it on purpose?
B.Zs.: The fact that they stood in the back was due to purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
In the number it is also a matter of forgetting one's ego a little, forgetting who has come from and where to go, we simply allow these particular wings, the wings of love, to lift us up.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song came into being.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the musical work actually none, there were more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't want to work for a while, but gradually everything came together, like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and even now that I have left the album "lost".
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Counterfeit brokers risked billions of dollars because of inferiority
Groundless scammers
For example, his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka, is named.
It came for him by almost five billion euros.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was only a big player who wanted to do it to his colleagues, and was certainly not incapable of doing so.
Unlike all major bank houses, he recognized the crisis on the American mortgage market in time.
"He is rather mentally weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who reported him to the police.
However, as Kerviel's statements, published by the French media, for example the daily Le Monde, show, he was a person who had made profits of 1.6 billion euros with his businesses at the end of last year.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he had managed to earn half a billion euros in the American crisis.
He had already discovered the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February there were already first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had earlier payment problems, would get into trouble.
But this crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe this and was right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profit to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Even when I had earned the first half a billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel admits and goes on to say that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he faked documents so he wouldn't get caught up in a scam.
He even managed to deceive his bosses, even though the Eurex stock exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position step by step.
He entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90000.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"During my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigators.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With Allianz shares, he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros in the London bombings on price losses for this title.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses supposedly knew everything, or they suspected it.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
But then the big blow came at the beginning of this year.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they get to him?
He was suspicious about a vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to be looked into the cards," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will allow the Czech Republic to reach EUR 14 billion in the next few years (approximately CZK 365 billion).
It is about half of the amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion kroner come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion kroner from the "Business and Innovation" programme.
Most money, about 150 billion, will be spent on transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money will increase according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Enterprise and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies to attract funds to innovative enterprises.
The aim is to raise finance for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is among the least successful among the new candidate countries in the past acquisition of money from EU funds.
Nicaraguan court confirms 20 years in prison for ex-presidents
On Thursday, a court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) is again behind bars of this Central American state is currently unclear according to the news agency AP.
According to Ileana Pérez, chairman of the Court of Appeals, it will now depend on the prison officials whether Alemán is allowed to serve his sentence at home or whether he has to go to prison.
A court proved four years ago that Alemán had regularly transferred government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his 2001 campaign.
Budget is made up of:
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this household?
It is the first budget designed by this government and adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The one for the current year was still approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (from this party) had submitted it and the ČSSD could not therefore allow itself to reject it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Deputies approved this traditionally little-respected, yet highly significant law in all peace.
It's kind of paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is obscured by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more appreciative subject for the media, and that is why they devote more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting for the public than sober figures.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past social democratic governments, which the budget for 2008 cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure required by law, not only pensions, but also social expenditure decided by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) last year before the elections.
The second is deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weak point.
The third restriction is the deficits in public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and reasonably under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the communities.
Many mayors, in order to tap into other sources of investment other than income from taxes, levies, and bank loans, often issued unconsidered debt securities that over-inflicted their town halls.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off this debt through the mass sale of shares in the energy and other supply networks that they had received from the state on the train of privatization.
Now this source has already dried up.
As far as we stick only to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a period of growth for several years, the ČSSD boasting without ceasing.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, these governments owe the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our Republic.
This is a huge shame, mainly due to previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why no massive social programmes are needed, which, unfortunately, have been inflated to a gigantic extent, even in the last few years.
Although it has been possible to delete some of the senseless populist spending that was adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is not to be a shift in the retirement age and a pension reform in the near future, virtually any policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, it will remain nothing but mere management.
It is only slightly exaggerated when it is said that then ruling politicians become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social spending.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only halt the displacement of normal expenditure through compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion kroner planned for 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments had not spent over the last ten years, which was all that was possible.
If we do not want it to really happen that ruling politicians become mere administrators, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on taxes and fees to want rest in preparing further reform laws.
Only these will enable a balanced state budget to be gradually enforced.

Banks want to cope with crisis
The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on the financial markets.
For example, more than $100 billion will go to the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, the banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the American Fed is sending $40 billion to auction, and another $24 is making it loose for the European and Swiss central banks.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that national central banks have agreed on such a coordinated approach to countering or mitigating the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group consultancy in a report for his clients.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unserved loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of dollars to be lost.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what could still happen when they decided to do so," said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have hard access to bonds, loans will also be more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, possibly affecting economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate, which is used in the lending of money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend each other money, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain had lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by central banks contributes to heating up the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Ecologists’ debates are implausible
Global climate change is said to be the most damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again commented on the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the end of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not a green planet", he stated that the debates of the ecologists were implausible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it's a word firework that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that his subject matter was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction at the fact that his book appears in German translation because "I often encounter caricatures of my views."
So now interested ones could read his attitude undistortedly.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
After all, he was an academic, capable of understanding and judging technical papers, had experience with statistics and was also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore are not a threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptably burdensome.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, he considers it a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not opposed to "a sensible environmental protection, but to militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had already talked about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
600000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where you can apply for an exchange so that the authorities can issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the ministry does not fear that after New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will go to the streets without a valid driving licence.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not changed their driving licence.
While small towns report a sharp drop in interest in the exchange of tickets, the offices of the capital are being filled with applications, and interest in the exchange grew this week.
The city administration manufactures around 2000 customers daily.
You have to wait about half an hour.
In Prague about 140000 drivers have not changed their driver's license yet.
The issue of a new driving license lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver has to pay 500 crowns.
Motorists who fail to make the required exchange by the end of the year and leave without a valid driving licence are facing a fine from January onwards.
The culprit pays a maximum of 2000 kroner.
But the police can also leave it with an admonition when committing transgression.
In the event of a violation, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, even the one who does not drive can get a penalty imposed by the municipality.
It was said that he could face a penalty of even 30,000 kroner.
The ministry has already called on the offices to exercise mildness and impose a maximum penalty of 1000 kroner.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one threatened a thousand crown sentence.
The driving licence was a document where everyone could decide whether or not to own it.
It is not an identity card that everyone, and indeed a valid one, must have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their license.
It is sufficient to take him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by registered letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will become invalid.
However, drivers will have to gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court Lowers Penalties for Detectives Associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, accused of having made a joint case with the gang of David Berdych, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
This was decided by the Prague Higher Regional Court in a final judgment, which reduced its sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight Against Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no appeal against today's judgment, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused in this case, but he is faced with the first instance judgment at first instance.
In other trials, however, he had already received fines of a total of 16 years.
He can't be sentenced to more.
In January, a district court found 19 people guilty mainly of involvement in robberies, and today the Oberlandesgericht tried the appeal of 16 of them.
From the outset, most of the accused contested the charges on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police, in consultation with, among other things, Berdych, handed over information from police sources, covered various robberies, and helped members of the gang escape prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Koňařík with 30 percent of the loot.
The prosecution is about crimes committed by the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robbery, the victims of which have often suffered serious injuries, but also impeachment and illicit possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel core, a laser rifle and a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has been enriched by many millions of crowns by their robberies.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this trial, courts recognized Berdych and a number of others as guilty of further robberies.
Other men from Berdych's circle have to answer in another trial, other cases have not yet come to court.
Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody and are waiting for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic, have missed the main hearing so far.
Children swapped - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand 12 million kroner compensation from the hospital in Třebář plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore completely disagrees with the proposal made by Velebas.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," said Dostál after today's trial.
"In order to be able to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, however, we need the expert opinion that had the opposite side drawn up.
We'll find out if it's even meaningful.
We insist, however, that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for all," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should range between 100000 and 200000 kroner for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million kroner for every month that their biological daughter had not raised.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an expert report prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, children's parents suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in varying degrees of strength and depth.
The men tolerated the stress situation better, even if they faced accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, on the other hand, get along worse with the aftereffects of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is currently going on, Veleba summarized the content.
On 9 December last year, Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the maternity clinic in Třebíč.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district chief of the Vysočina (Böhmisch-Mährische Höhe) handed over 100000 crowns to each family as a substitute for expenses incurred by the hospital in Třeb
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally liable.
In case of doubt, they must resort to a reserve fund, only exceptionally can they request assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far awarded comparatively low compensation amounts to those affected, the amounts have been determined by tables and have moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka came for his kingdom Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the "Kingdom of Wallachia" brand.
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walachian king", but the project had built up a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor.
Polívka did not participate in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not over and his client is likely to appeal.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in Bolek Polívka's parasitic popularity," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
All of them introduced themselves to this actor and comedian in the words "Walachic Kingdom".
Harabiš is also of the same opinion.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money procurement and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the cause is a dispute over money.
"After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to gain parasitic in our work," he continued.
Lukrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television programs.
In 1993, actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
But that was not related to the intention to establish a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came to the idea of issuing walachic passports.
Out of an originally fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity emerged, to which Harabiš then joined the founding of the company "Walachisches Königschaft".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš only used the mere idea that Polívka had made public in the show "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívka certainly helped the project of the Wallachian kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabiš project and his team had dedicated themselves intensively to him.
The cooperation of the parties that are now divided lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, there have been disputes between Polívka and Harabiš that culminated in the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected until the day of Saint-Nimmerlein".
At the suggestion of Harabiš Jarmila Šuláková, the leading role was taken as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court dismissed today.
The contest prepared by Harabiš could bring clarity in the dispute for the throne and half a princess.
From this a new king was to emerge.
He didn't want to reveal details and an appointment yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It was supposed to be something like the king's parade in Walachia.
The king was to be elected for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also register quietly," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Decrease advantages
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear shift, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that is much better.
The combination with the designation SW is still a bit further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic Hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the lack of headroom in the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the station wagon is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Keep moving fast
I'm just going through the interior for a moment, so I don't want to repeat myself too much.
It is a rather successful design, where I have objections only because of the meager middle tunnel.
I would welcome a bit more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over when we may have complained about too short seats or head restraints.
The sidehold has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As far as the room supply is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body here.
In the station wagon the already mentioned lack of headroom is also eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car is the cargo bay.
I must call it (also because of the folding rear window) very good loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with straps, which are an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, can be pulled apart and also hold heavier objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not in comparison to the Czech top-selling vehicle of this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav product, we find that the Peugeot is left by a clearly noticeable 52 liters.
This value is already critical for a holiday abroad or when loading a stroller.
But to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat loading space after folding the rear seats or also the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 kWp.
And to be honest, that's what a 1600-cubic engine should look like, driving a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him to his counterpart at Škoda, which sometimes seems to be his exhaust plugged with a rag, then I can only be thrilled by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
We have to remember, however, that we have tested a well equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine in the amount of 329900 kroner still starts.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The equipment Premium of the test car beats again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper release, electric window lifters at the back and and...
So the car costs a total of simple 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but put together the additional equipment of a Fabia and you will arrive at a very similar amount.
So all that remains is the choice of which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, causing fears among locals about the further development of the local education system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants are increasing in violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated by the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between the locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Arguments, harassment, and brawls among students have been transferred to relationships between parents.
The situation has already developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended himself with the fact that the boy insulted her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene against a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two underage girls.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed a bushhouse and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then exposed his buttocks," a mother of Slovak students from The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the conflict with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In Great Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here looking for a job.
Some 30000 Slovak pupils are therefore attending British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday will come true if you only choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters who offer pizza, ice cream and beguiling cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the very end of the 20th century.
One of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, built it because everything that was considered a crime in the US (especially during prohibition) was gladly seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
==References====External links==
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rises grew, and across the broad boulevards were cars that were among the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as you wish.
And the cult cars of the 1950s drive around in Havana to this day, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and damp air.
If Havana, in particular its oldest part, is severely run down, nowhere can you find as many wonderful colonial sights as here.
Other places are being cleaned up, such as Trinidad.
With regard to the fact that tourism brings much needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a moat that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam- and diesel-powered narrow-gauge railways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see clean and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have long been in the museum elsewhere.
Excursion destinations
Most of Cuba's visitors do not miss the most important places.
So you don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail anymore.
The only thing to mention is that there is a museum in the aforementioned Hemingways estate, the visit of which should not be missed by anyone who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on calcareous soil.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities fertile soil was accumulated, through which also weathered rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was shot there.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
The trade in slaves and sugar brought fame and wealth to her.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was no road connecting the area to the rest of the country.
This isolation helped to keep it unattended.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon for Trinidad, it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the "Valley of Sugar Mills".
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la Música, which revives after the darkness, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads, which lead from Guantánamo to it, have to overcome high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
Thanks to its untouched nature, UNESCO included this eastern outpost in its World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is produced there, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, you can see several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves profess, about all this one could write many pages.
But, as they say, look better with your own eyes.
Ally in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment influence the course of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go according to their wishes, as the representatives of the countries that stationed units in the south of the country agreed on this in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states will also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called for NATO units to be more active, Britain sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"A forward development is noticeable in Afghanistan, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to start developing their own economy and security," says British Defense Minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the American army, the activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years.
The number of acts of violence increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, and even by sixty percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have stationed some 40000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of which about a quarter are in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
More specifically, they call for other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and the way we can achieve them," Gates said.
The Secretary General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, spoke similarly today.
"I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop of Reuters Agency at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries involved, there has also been a dispute over whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best in recent months.
For example, Germany was criticized for passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting demands for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
This week, the British tabloid newspaper "Sun" called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan non-stuers exposed: The Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bildzeitung went on to counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Public debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a national debt of 84000 kroner.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government had planned to debt itself with 159.2 billion kunas this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy.
Public debt in the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they thus increased by 40,2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on the sovereign debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has a debt of 84000 kroner.
Over the entire past year, the state owed more than 111 billion kroner.
"It seems so far that, thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the limit of one trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year, the debt should range between 900 billion and one trillion kroner," said David Marek, analyst at Patria Finance, the iHNed.cz server.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, analyst at Next Finance: "We could come to exceed one trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly depends on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could last until 2010.
But I do not assume such a change," he remarked.
Debt growth
The debt of the state comes from the debt of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
The sovereign debt is financed by Treasury bills, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, bonds issued by the European Investment Bank.
Domestic public debt rose to 719.4 billion kroner this year.
The foreign debt of the state now rose by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called marketable sovereign debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and fell by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of sovereign debt increased to 6.5 years.
"Over the year, the total debt increased by 13 percent from the first to the third quarter, which is really much in view of how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting to note that the increase is mainly in the debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand, this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of public debt for 2007 show that the government had planned this year to absorb 159.2 billion kroner.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which is apparently going to reach 76 billion kroner this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion kroner.
It is also a maximum budget for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion kroner, a ten billion reserve to pay pensions, the financing of sovereign bonds for 43 billion and the instalments for bonds with the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was brought before a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been charged with insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion.
The British woman was accused of having allowed six to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic Prophet is forbidden.
She deserves to be flogged.
After parents of students complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at the Unity High School in Khartoum, was picked up at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September, when the teacher asks her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed , reports headmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common first name in Sudan.
Afterwards the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed .
The bear himself did not wear a shield with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the portrayal of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said that he knows them well, and that she never did anything that would have allowed her to get too close to a religious faith, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his view it is only an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by numerous students of the teacher who describe it as very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks about religion in the class.
Consider that the first name Mohammed is also the second most frequently given second name in Britain, for which 14 different spellings exist in English.
This name, often chosen by Muslim families, is regarded as a kind of homage to the Prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last meeting of the negotiations in Vienna, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria, Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversies about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach agreement on the status , said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart, Frank Wilsner, called on Belgrade and Pristina to fulfil their commitments to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, indicating that there are quite clear tensions.
End of placements on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of 90% of the Albanian-speaking inhabited province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submitted their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and final negotiating meeting since the Troika had received a mandate from the UN last August for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the granting of Kosovo's independence to the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this final date.
Russia was and remains the advocate of a negotiated solution, a mutually agreed solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After eight years of Kosovo being under the administration of the UN, the Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is willing to proclaim this unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, announced Fatmir Sejdiu, president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been conducted since Monday of the last opportunity.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regret.
He added, however, that the plan proposed by Belgrade included the autonomy of a past that led to murders and deportations.
Domino Effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, believed that a compromise should always be sought and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it particularly favors a "domino effect" in a region that is still so much weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be taken solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end up as they have begun: in the Security Council.
The journalists were told by Fatmir Sejdiu that Kosovo's parliament would have the last word on status, and added that any unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian-speaking population would take place in consultation with the Western countries.
Bush eludes an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference held in Annapolis, Maryland on Tuesday under his leadership, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally reached a joint declaration.
He also stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately in order to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments with regard to the roadmap for peace that they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas ultimately seek a peace treaty to resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including central issues.
This term covers the three major problems that the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians are mainly dealing with: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who were expelled from their homes in the present state of Israel in the course of the 1948 conflict.
After the American president, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and that all points be regulated, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert, for his part, took the floor, he undertook that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would endeavour to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of its vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, which coexist, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that Bush has given Bush an assurance in this sense before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries to offer peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi-Arab prince says in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily newspaper.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation carried out by the National Disciplinary Bureau of the Police (IGPN), a police car drove to Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m.
He had no mission, but was on patrol, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explains a spokesman of the police.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, without registration, so not approved for public road traffic (see below), came, controlled by two young people without helmet, started at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it had disregarded its driveway from the right, a policeman explained further.
The alcohol control carried out at the vehicle passengers is much negative.
The condition of the car (buried fender, broken windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of involuntary personal murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the main Directorate for Public Security of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that at this stage, the investigation of the ICPN precludes the responsibility of the police.
According to the Magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small motorcycle arrived relatively quickly on their left side.
Yesterday, a kind of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained hooked together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to a technical review.
The bodies of the two victims were examined yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the rounds that the police would have left the accident site very quickly, and without helping the two young people.
Although the ICPN remains very cautious, it would rule out any serious errors concerning this matter as well.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation for which further investigations are necessary and where one has to be very careful.
Libération has met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, says this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman, who limped.
Two others tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth on the phone.
In view of the tension that had quickly developed around the event and, it seems, because of the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow the police forces to claim that they have not helped the young people.
First aid has been given to these young people.
The fire department came right away.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor emphasized.
In Pakistan the tension is rising
On Monday, the Pakistani police knocked down the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared the state of emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the emergency measures taken were injured by the tear gas grenades used by the police there.
They then threw stones with which they injured the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several of them would have been arrested temporarily.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court's Bar have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of approximately 500 arrests of opposition activists, human rights advocates and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations had taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northeast).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president called on the people to send flowers and those who took an oath before Musharraf to the judges who had spoken out against the emergency.
Musharraf’s promise no longer applies
Pakistan’s Supreme Court is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
In the following days he had to take a stand on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct ballot on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court, the Magistrate of the newspaper The News explained.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to surrender command of the army and become a civilian president is no longer valid since the invocation of the state of emergency, declared on Monday the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would hand over his military uniform by 15 November, the date on which his first term as president ended.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned a place of residence by his deputy commander.
Still more than a third of pregnancies are not planned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception, such as the pill or the spiral, still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of age who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned these days.
With one out of five pairs even calculated on the month accurately, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools made by astronauts to carry out the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery space shuttle, a large cylindrical part that will soon take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to power them.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5-ton module for power generation via solar panels, which was already on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew went to the restructuring of the solar panels of the module, whose wingspan is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors that can be folded up like accordions was damaged by a jammed cable on a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who were originally to leave the space shuttle Discovery for a control passage and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30 meter long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to the station to carry out repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, he has a well developed torso and long arms.
The 46-year-old doctor was selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After careful examination of the damage, he severed the faulty cable and fixed some kind of rails on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey bat, wrapped with an insulator to prevent an electric blow on the solar panels that produce several hundred volts, the astronauts on board the station had designed and made.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully folded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the Discovery space shuttle today to make their return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the Aviation and Defence Group announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion in order to counteract the A400M’s residues, the EADS share is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to re-examine its business forecasts for 2007 with reference to the residues caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delay the aircraft’s maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further details.
The Group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month lag.
As a reminder, the business performance of EADS has fallen from 86% in 2006, largely due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, that of the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned for the first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
On Sunday, it will not be exciting to count the polls: the mass of Russians will opt for President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, it confirms its pursuit of stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to voters on public channels, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He is doing this in his capacity as the leading candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kreml party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, when the President received the foreign ambassadors, the President didn't let anything go through, and he was satisfied with a new attack on the Western powers accused of interference - his favourite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the opposition's point of view, they have misplaced themselves.
It denounces an election campaign tainted by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there has never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, ex-Chess World Champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrators, according to his lawyer continues to ban visits.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovietus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two much more questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as President?
The term of office yesterday announced the date of the first round of presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third consecutive term.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party United Russia, the government and president will choose?
Whatever it is, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the power to date will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have retained the mentality of Homo Sovietus, they are not masters of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Centre Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further down: bourgeois society in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe, has only developed very slowly; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has once again built on the model of a paternalist state, which was completely accepted by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility they have shown for a short time after the collapse of the USSR.
What's the point of thinking for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all walks of life, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to keep the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional leaders) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What do you think about for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why replace them?
A Heavy Memory
After being kept confidential for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are located in Bad Arolsen over a total length of 27 km, could not be viewed until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, that is, individual and name-related, i.e. by questioning a former victim or his relatives.
The eleven states responsible for their administration, including Germany, France, Israel and the USA, agreed in May 2006 to make it accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Cheerful information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow them to conduct investigations, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of the forced labourers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like, for example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The prison records of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo were collected after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen still handle tens of thousands of personal inquiries.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
One should not expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, declared Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Antisemitism of the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to achieve a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, trade between India and Europe is already reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
Last April, EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission the green light to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), with mutual trade between India and Europe reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will drive the two economic areas forward enormously and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans , Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, the European Commissioner added. The Asian and European giants annually exchange goods worth 47 billion euros and services worth 10 billion euros, said this week Daniéle Smadja, chairman of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, and regrets that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India will meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England notes the concern and offers £10 billion for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed concern at curbing current concern over credit conditions and announced an offer of £10 billion with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate fears that financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty as to the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions at that time, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings deposits during the maintenance phase, which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, it states in a communication.
The Bank further states that this will put 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) into circulation on December 6th at GMT, at the property tax rate and only until January 10th.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE has put liquidity into circulation for five weeks in an open market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, BoE adds that it is prepared to take further measures to maintain the daily differential interest rates on inter-Bänkian loans at their basic interest rate.
The inter-Bänkian interest rate varies from day to day on Wednesday at 5,829%.
The three-month interest rate has moved to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with fines that the banks had prevented from using.
According to certain rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound exchange rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text produced by a socialist niche (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the PS National Committee, most of which were on the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIP, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to some violent exchanges of views between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's TV show on purchasing power.
The leader of the MPs of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of finances, which had been examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones of C3 told Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500 acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as the Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989 he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever been to, says that his company and Melvin Benn's are working side by side to provide the area with a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We had negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates on the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents brought the Lollapaloza Festival back to life in 2005 at Grand Park Chicago, following its profile in the world of the festival in 2002 together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events were able to achieve $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in gross tax payments.
These two festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while ours are more likely to take place on urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in one way or another, in order at the same time to convey the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban way in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is taking the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to include a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the festival's recording capacity is "very large", roughly according to the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners of C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Prize of the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It's not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no one else stands up to it than the Terminator.
These lock attempts are among the delegate's tasks.
A politically "hot mandate" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "Governor"?
"You have to be careful, because it's the industry that decides where it's going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the promotion of the cinema there is a top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all West Coast Festivals, although Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The Dark Age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market facing an end-year rally? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks to the annual financial statements on the stock market, investors are already rubbing hands with regard to the coming end-year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts are not able to provide reliable forecasts in this respect.
Banif believes that from a purely statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock exchange is usually accompanied by a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially when serious tensions determine the current market situation.
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the last weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the stock market price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and market participants. Due to the lack of safe equity funds, these invest mainly in pension funds, which is heavily affected by the value-added trend towards profitable assets.
As a result, according to these experts, the stock market will tend to have a more lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible decline in the US Federal Reserve interest rate, an uncertainty mainly due to the increased crude oil price and the risk of rising inflation.
Javier Barrio, Chairman of the Sales Department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a bold time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its highest mark on 8 November of 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully close the year with almost 16,000 points, as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional subsidy of the pension fund, which was made around this time each year.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that things could develop a little differently this year, mainly due to the final year rally that was already taking place in the second week of December, and thus directly after the day of the bridge to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the market situation assessments so far are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values in the near future, which depend on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
The analysts agree on the selection of the values to push the Ibex towards new maximum levels.
Solana of Intermoney affirms that it is the turn of the great values this year.
One of the value winners would be the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha from Bank Inversis assures that the increases in connection with the banking and industrial sectors will be accompanied.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been catching up in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, says the expert.
With regard to the increased consumption behaviour during Christmas days, periodic consumption will determine market activity in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has seen only two declines in prices.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the so far last real end-year rally.
This year, when the Ibex 35 picked up by 28.17 percentage points, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex increases by 8.36% since January) and can also show an end-year rally will be evident.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open from Monday to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in the strongest economic regions in Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the remaining Spanish institutions, as Popular is the first banking group to dare to extend the opening hours of its branches weekdays to 20.30h and start Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The banking group BBVA, which also repeatedly reported the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The Bank's current negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aimed at reaching an agreement where 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open on one day of the week in the afternoon, albeit not for customers.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening times, will depend on the experience of Popular Bank.
And that is precisely the intention popular pursues with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which, due to their location, can capture the purchasing customers of independent, small and medium-sized companies as well as those of large department stores.
The Bank intends to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will transform the premises of those branches that are already located in business zones and at the same time align them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of the opening hours is combined with a new interior design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colorful design.
The relevant bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require major investments, but would be accompanied by an increased recruitment, as a branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine stores in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The offices of the streets Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been chosen for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages approx. 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These specialize in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these stores, PopularMax does not use the BBVA model, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to compete for our customers, Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have provisionally agreed to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private channel Telecinco doubles its market value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The channel he directed had increased its value by two times its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that's exactly what hurt me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not fallen too low.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66% this year.
According to Bloomberg, goodwill now reaches EUR 4,488,88 million, with Mediaset controlling the majority of capital (52%), and Vocento holding only 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, bringing its market value to 2,193.46 million to half.
The market value of other publicly listed communications companies, on the other hand, increases; in the case of Sogecable, to 3,571 million, in the case of Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco Días), to 2,518.53 million and in the case of Vocento, to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that it is two similar companies, according to Vasile.
The question still seems uncertain to what extent we can actually act in exchange terms, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its intention to become the first television station this year with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenues, as assured by Guiseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the Group's advertising company.
If the project was to be implemented, the channel would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock market (up to 734.4 million), while net revenues from the television business could only increase by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The analysts see the main factor for Telecinco's comparative better stock market performance in the high payout ratio that the company has been able to show up to now: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarría initiated a 100% dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that after the purchase of 33% of Endemol's shares, with Mediaset as its parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged by the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always stated much more so far.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by purchasing 33% of the Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market currently has certain losses.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and by 7.5% in 2009.
Three options.
1.
Ibersecuritys: relies on its high effective return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buy) is more advantageous than Antena 3 because of the multiple incentives and the prosperous market.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends resetting expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
The Congress agreed to the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with the parliamentary drafting, which ended its session today with the Congress decision in the Senate on the additional/amendments related to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of Congress and Senate members, who in their negotiations and votes had the aim of establishing the best possible regulation, which ensures the security of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities, in order to guarantee a generally efficient market activity.
In addition to modernising financial markets, the MIFID, which re-establishes the Investment Services Regulation, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, an increase in the rights of control of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows financial advisory services to be offered to specialised firms as well as to natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the creation of new financial services companies (ESIS), the consultancy companies that join forces with investment and brokerage companies in securities.
It also extends the number of systems for carrying out financial transactions so that the regulated circulation markets are added to the multilateral systems of securities trading and the systems for internationalising trading orders, which would eventually compete with current economic operators.
The law obliges investment companies to make known the priorities of their company profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV's control task.
The Congressional Economic Commission subsequently made further changes, with the decision that due to its high level of risk, the bond must now be regarded as complex financial resources for the investor, confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the areas of work of graduate economists was used; 30 years after 1977, the regulation restricting the areas of work reserved for economists was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as those of the commercial mediator, who works on behalf of others, does not need authorisation from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialization of products and for the acquisition of customers at the same time several investment companies.
The harmonised index of consumer prices (CPIs) rose by five tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess inflation rates within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication is in accordance with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to establish a local and quality comparison with US products by means of the publication of the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared early by applying the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the indicator identified earlier would only serve as a benchmark and therefore would not be in line with the final result announced next 14 December.
The consumer price index (CPIs) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November was a temporary development and at the same time he assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless , Solbes found in the halls of the Congress building that even if the current figure is not good , the inflation differential between Spain and the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years .
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4% , the Minister of Economy and Finance announced with regard to the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
Northern Rock's assets have fallen by more than half after the Bank had asked the British central bank for emergency loans in mid-September of last year due to a crisis, and they now amount to only £12,000 million (equivalent to €16,800 million).
At that time, the Bank’s assets amounted to a record £25,000 million, a sum that has fallen considerably within two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence and, despite the government’s 100% guarantee that the money was safe, will continue to decline until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which would continue to run the group after the acquisition under the Virgin Money brand name, will have to contribute about a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will consist of the assets of the next three years, in order to acquire exactly the 18 billion pounds needed to achieve their target of 30 billion.
The group of multi-millionaire Richard Branson, who is known for his prominent advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to channel 50,000 million pounds (equivalent to approximately 70 million euros) annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of participation in urban planning corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular), which belongs to the municipality of Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was revealed this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo held the position of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Popular Party and then chairman of the Totana Municipal Council, and according to information from Cadena SER, could be the original mastermind of the plot.
Officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused by Juan Morales, the prime suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to information from Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and therefore privileged deputy Juan Morales was arrested when leaving the residence of his client on the basis of important incriminating documents related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report on Morales' alleged order payments to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban planning contract in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE's candidacy in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a victory of the Socialists, he will take over as President of Congress.
José Blanco, PSOE's Secretary of Organization, and Bono announced it at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero at the party's headquarters today.
In the view of the Head of State, the offer to the former Minister is justified because it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
Moreover, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the coming elections, the Mancha politician would appear to be running for the party as chairman of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as President of Congress, who had announced last November 15 that he would no longer take part in the next general elections, that he would end his career in public politics and instead work for climate protection in the university sector.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the Government has been pushing for his return to political activity.
He also pointed out that, as in the case of the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party would not withhold from the citizens who would take over the position of President of the Congress in the event of an election victory, and described this as an act of transparency.
If he really should take office, he hopes to transform the Chamber into a house of respect and not of insult or outcry, in order to make it seem more and more similar to the citizens.
Regrettably, from time to time, one gets the impression that the only place where one cannot speak calmly and calmly in Madrid is the Congress; so once the President of the Government in the Senate was interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and suggested that he did not want to give the impression that he had already taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
As the climate debate exposes both the skeptics of climate change and those who place a social and political debate at the forefront in this regard, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement, who, as in the case of Prime Minister Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal puts it in need of explanation regarding the actions or non-action of its government, which has played a decisive role in ensuring that Spain is at the forefront of the countries that have least met the Kyoto Protocol’s requirements within the EU.
Who are those responsible for failing to meet the targets, which sectors are responsible for this, and why did his government, which proposed the treaty with the planet, not stop this development.
In addition, he is now forced to explain to Spanish citizens the measures he intends to take to combat climate change without delay.
Which companies will be affected by it, which behaviour of the citizens should be changed, which individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and which economic consequences result from it.
More precisely, who has to sacrifice himself and will pay for saving the planet.
However, there are and will be no such explanations in the future.
It's just because it's about sacrifice and payment.
The measures that can be used to combat climate change in real terms are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE seemed to Zapatero so dangerous in electoral terms that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, minutes and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the politician, otherwise suitable for election campaigns, neither has to talk, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue, to decorate the meetings and to inspire others with his meekness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or we can only refresh ourselves with a fan.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to a supposed involvement in an urban-planning corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the Murcia-based town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. Moreover, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel contractor were taken into custody because of suspected urban planning violations, according to investigation circles today.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises he is until now, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and at the municipal construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the searches that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where it turned out that more than 2 million hectares of untapped land for urban development projects should be redesigned under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which was to build 4000 apartments on the property after the local administration had given it illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested directly, but were subject to an investigation initiated and conducted by Totona's first court.
The first six arrested were brought before the judge today.
According to investigation circles, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP deputy Juan Morales are also investigated.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, who resides in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the Vigo-based lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is said to have acted as a subgroup of Nuaria and received the bribe.
The investigations are carried out by the local authority against urban development offences, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven further searches, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farming industry, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometers of land in Totana, which was to be rebuilt. The aim was to realize a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates the parking spaces of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and that of Plaza Fernando el Católico in Vigo; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the term book of the month and instead try to invent a price name of another name with appropriate competencies.
I already have a suggestion.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are cordially invited to submit your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the top of the PISA study), which takes a stand on the note published in the same newspaper on November 18th, coincidentally on that day, whose issue contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the subject of philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a high school graduate who quoted Plato's and Nietzsche's works in his news.
In an interview with Helsingin Sanomat, Pekka Elo, chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, asked the teachers to take a more critical position against Plato and proposed to remove Plato's teaching from the lower-level curriculum for philosophy at high schools.

A colleague informed about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the criminal code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law, which would be related to six months imprisonment.
But if again you rob a music business with a value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, then the theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than with a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and give it back forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than with a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in a music data exchange.
To participate in a rebellious struggle results in a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data results in a deprivation of liberty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, whose authorisation by the authors has not taken place, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, then someone has raised his demands quite a bit.

My family doctor presents me with one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially if the others get more of it.
So the feelings arising from the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of colleagues.
The study was carried out using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the Science journal.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research center Life&Brain, activation was strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were correct with their response and therefore received the same content; but when one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it actually takes so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been inexorably searching for the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years. Her office is located in the Prosecutor’s Office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave office with a crying and laughing eye, as the main leaders of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed - namely the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic are still at large.
Their names are on the list of Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach as a model for the title of his documentary film La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet started in Spain); a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, pursues the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her attempt to track down the escaped criminals and put pressure on the respective governments to narrow their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
The motor vehicle insurance, which covers a possible case of damage caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which again depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of issue of the driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even harder to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, it must be clear what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder.
This agreement shall be recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract which determines that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to present the corresponding compensation amount in the event of a claim.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance which is composed of several factors, including age, sex, date of issue of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contributions are also due in the event of a higher risk of accidents.
For this reason, both over 25 and women have to pay less contributions, as statistics show that, thanks to their caution, these groups have a lower accident rate.
The same applies to married persons, who, according to the statistics and therefore also according to the firm's conviction, tend to have fewer accidents than single persons.
The benefit attributed to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus also the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting the premium, insurance companies must take account of a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to choose exactly the car insurance that best suits his personal needs.
We now list the most important points that should be considered when choosing an insurance policy in order to be able to make not only a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
The under-25s encounter numerous obstacles when choosing low-cost insurance, such as low driving practice and the young driver's license.
Even if it would be best to take out comprehensive insurance for an ideal insurance cover, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The careful drivers can choose a fully self-employed driver, so that the benefits of a comprehensive insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer must pay part of the amount incurred by the damage himself.
The amount is determined before the conclusion of the contract and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain's main representative at First Europa, an online insurance broker.
Another option is the extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused to his own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you are under 25 years old, it is in your hands to reduce insurance costs; so your credit is increased by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate of the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in the tariff.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it may be possible to increase the bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to sign a contract. This is due to the fact that the accident rate decreases with increasing driving practice.
Thus, it is most appropriate to opt for a fully comprehensive insurance with a deductible.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been abandoned.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to take full insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the person concerned allows it.
On the part of insurers, couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly, their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, the best option would be a comprehensive insurance with a deductible (with an amount of around 300 euros). In the case of a high credit, it is recommended that an extended insurance, which does not start until the third year of the vehicle.
They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to set a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera notes.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out a comprehensive insurance with a deductible (for an amount of around 150 euros) or an extended insurance, which only applies with a sufficiently high credit.
In the end, it is important to note that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damage, but also because it entails high costs, which require a thorough selection to be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes for the point for the eighth final in Milan
Milan FC and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting for the point they lack to reach their respective goals before the end of the Championsleague preliminary round next Tuesday in San Siro. Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while the latter decides on their participation in the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow with nine points still needs another to make sure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up with the Befica Lisbon with four points.
Group D's two games will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan FC will have to compete at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where it will fight for the first time in the semi-final on the 13th, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be finished ahead of all others and the draw in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the generally expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtics Glasgow knows that they would be the group's first in the event of a victory and would thus have a better starting position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be able to qualify for a defeat in a slopp of Shakhtar FC. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points the Ukrainians are entitled to participate; they had lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but were able to win in the second match (2-0).
Thus, the Milanese will try to ruin the evening for the Scots. Again, they hope to reach the eighth round of the redesigned Championsleague for the second time in a row, after they were defeated in the previous season in exactly the same round by a goal of Kaka in the follow-up time (1-0) and by a zero to zero draw on the round.
While Shakhtar FC is waiting for the Rossoneri to win, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the eighth round and joining UEFA depend on their victory and defeating Celtic Glasgow.
Despite his lower standings and the prospect of continuing to compete in the biggest European championship, the Benfica Lisbon could win third place by winning and thus play in UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, after the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained just before their concert at GM Place de Vancouver that the atmosphere in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people witnessed the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video about the band's history, which had caused a stir at the end of the nineties, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes its biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, which is released in Spain under the EMI label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden armbands on stage, which the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham, had previously given them.
The athlete was among the crowds who made the GM Palace glow, even though the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the Schow, Victoria Beckham said that the British star has not seen our wardrobe once, and so I am very excited about what he will think of the performance.
Sporty Spice , whose departure from the group in 1998 caused the group to disband two years later due to internal disagreements, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings to the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought why not; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm said about the separation of the band she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also said that the disputes were resolved and that they were all very fond of each other again.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, according to reports from CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver in a Virgin Airlines special aircraft.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nannies.
The five have seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform next in California, San José (on December 4th) and Los Angeles (on December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on December 23rd.
New fears about gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is looming between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
Most of Russia's gas exports to the European Union (EU) are channelled through Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia with higher transit charges.
A previous conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be charged more because the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks," said the Minister of Economy of Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the Reuters news agency.
"The changing gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which dramatically pushed prices up.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve checks on criminal record records for workers from outside Europe, said one member of the supervisory body.
The recommendation of the chief financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought into connection with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish public health service had no precise idea of the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller investigated personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an off-road vehicle was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at Old Bailey in October and was charged with the alleged car bomb attack in Great Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks prior to hiring foreign staff to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the UK.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the Agency does not have the competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main examiner's report now states, among other recommendations, that the board should take up guidelines of the criminal record extract, which helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we found evidence of these controls in some personnel records, they were not routinely carried out," the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation guidelines with a high degree prior to employment, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks prior to hiring potential NHS staff.
"The report states that current pre-employment tests by NHS Scotland are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the board of directors would have problems identifying those employees who are on leave for an indefinite period of time.
The investigation also found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were largely complied with.
These include passport, work permit and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for controls prior to starting employment for foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "It was my concern to carry out this work in view of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on screening would be reflected in the run-up to the recruitment of all staff, including those from abroad, whose publication is planned next month.
Joy Division dominates film award ceremony
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five prizes at the British Independent Film Festival, including for the best film.
Awards were also given to leading actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded the best leading actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for bringing the British film into the world.
The prizes were presented in a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black and white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order can be found - was shot for only 3 million British pounds.
Nevertheless, he has presented two awards to the Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known so far for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree - as the best director and the best director's debut.
Rock music was the focus of another prize winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer was awarded the prize for the best documentary film.
The prize for the best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's thriller Easter Promises playing in London.
Ray Winstone, who is in the reputation of playing hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of person, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organisers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant as well as on clergy and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle in rockets.
sympathizers of Al-Qaeda have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid intervention force to protect installations following a failed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, with reference to an internal ministerial statement, says that 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a "missile expert" who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militants planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the detainees were planning to kill clergymen and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis striving for Iraq to join forces with Al Qaeda militias who want to fight the Allied Armed Forces and the U.S.-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the Hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias consider many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in support of the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arab-born Al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government - are targeting foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This was a huge effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman from the Ministry of the Interior told state television.
The arrests also concerned a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of the radical Sunni Muslims, which supports violence against Muslims who are branded as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the arrested were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal a view of the future of the Earth
Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from an orbital European spaceship show that the planet resembles an averted twin of the Earth even more than was previously aware.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, on Venus, conditions that would have been very similar to those on Earth and could have even been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unbridled carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotational pace, Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the space probe Venus Express of the European Space Agency, which has examined the planet for one year, offer a sobering look at how the Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Physics Department at Oxford University, one of the heads of the Venus Express mission, said, "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Enriched Uranium" seized by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said that three people were arrested and that the material was being checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything's still open
Mitt Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency finally agreed to engage in a debate on YouTube, where ordinary voters record and submit questions on video to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night, November 28, were as ridiculous as the Snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican party that is leaving for next year's elections.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate, who chose YouTube clips to show the candidate.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest one devoted to a single issue, immigration was the focus.
The subject is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial when they heard things they liked: The television station noticed tips of consent when the candidates spoke strictly about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who pushed himself forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the reputation that he was pliable about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney by accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two of them were particularly concerned as questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Unimportant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, succeeded in retracing this issue.
Neither of the two men has any serious chances at the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have hit the immigration spook sooner and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates broadly share the same views: stricter borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now contrary to all expectations in the first place in a recent survey conducted in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was urged to see if Jesus would support them, he laughed at them and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent fundraising successes and his incidental storms in the debate of Wednesday.
These two have been shot up out of nowhere, because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the beginning and convincingly united it with a victorious message about the greatness of America and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals this is not particularly slippery.
No titles seem to have been sold, no politicians paid Paris hotel bills, no extramarital toes sucked.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has concealed donations to the British ruling Labour Party for more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something that the contested Gordon Brown would have done well without.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister had withdrawn from the call for an election, stupidly insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinion polls did not influence this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly perceptive leader of the Liberal Democrats, put it, Stalin's once feared Brown has evolved into Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock, a battered bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have brought business associations against the government.
The tax-administrative loss of personal data of 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative fraud.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: to be a minister of the armed forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there is the manifold donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary General (and its former Head of Fulfillment) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is irrevocably leaving.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point that makes it impossible for them to rule.
People neither like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their scepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for long, this delay is over: the public service is beginning to leak; the cabinet ministers are beginning to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant-in-chief.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction documents, for example, are related to decisions made by Brown as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's mishap - as with the long "money for noble titles" investigation of political party financing - voters may assume it was him.
Still, Brown's situation isn't as bad as it looks
The faults are not as terrible as the Conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely deceived.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new drive for political donations is a good example.
The garboesque Abrahams, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be true, but he was not entitled to make the decision.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial collector, who was told about the weird donations in October.
But so far Brown has not been involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered down this determination by grasping for a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - to make the measure full, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, "the lessons to be learned" are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent committee on public standards, which has been vacant for six months, and moving forward with a radical reform of political party financing.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly to give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; they have two years to win back voters; and the only way to achieve victory is through unchallenged integrity and solid competence.
Card sharks
Is the credit crisis affecting America's credit card market?
If there's blood in the water, it's only natural that back fins swirl around excitedly.
Now that America's real estate market is ailing, predators are targeting the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both debits and default rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not recoverable or more than 30 days late.
Last month, HSBC announced that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its American consumer finance, partly due to the weakness of credit card holders.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and defaults are still low.
According to Moody, the 3rd quarter default rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
An amendment to the US private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy filings, which in turn account for a large part of the credit card loss; the number of filings (and thus default fees) would rise again, whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
Industry also reports sound payment rates showing how much of its debt consumers pay off every month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stalemate in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the output volumes for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers take credit card debt, now that home loans dry out.
However, card issuers look at the flow of money instead of capital, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower's creditworthiness.
They can even be of benefit to card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates fall if the real estate is less valuable than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among redemption priorities.
Card issuers can also react much faster and more flexibly than lenders to the stormier conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of the assets.
"We won't wake up one day and reassess the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a credit reduction push America into recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers, who were to be brought to justice for their role in the fraudulent system with the former head of finance of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their requests to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew originally pleaded innocently for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for alleged conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. district judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The allegations originally filed against them in 2002 drew the attention of Fastov to the fact that he was the aim of an investigation of the government in connection with the enron decline.
The charges against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claim that they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron, controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron powers that helped tear the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew that it was in fact of considerable value.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the Bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely argued to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers got 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others got about 12.3 million dollars, according to the charges.
In January 2004, Fastov pleaded guilty on two counts of conspiracy for his role in the Enrons bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison term in Louisiana Federal Prison.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and a month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was at liberty due to a $1 million bail, which made it necessary for them to live in the United States in anticipation of the trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest company, crumbled in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer make billions of debt disguise or weakening businesses appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value, and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling is punishable by more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges went down after he died last year because of heart disease.
Not at the very bottom of Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that's change for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it's for a private family or a business president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaires' Exhibition, a four-day orgy of showcased consumption held in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had built exhibition stands, hoping to attract new Russians to everything, from mahogany-paneled yachts to diamond-covered car grills that would be suitable for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the next booth.
"This is a nice car, but it's small change compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas did at its peak.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in droves, where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arab superflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear to be the world's most generous financiers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, attracted to share ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, with a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which together are worth 670 billion dollars, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, which was written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a panel of experts here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8% of the Russians lived below the subsistence threshold.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweller.
She had visited the trade fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well-kept and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they wear evening clothes on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothing she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed primarily to target the newcomers, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be ready to be in traffic for several hours to visit a cozy warehouse that shamelessly placed Cadillac Escalades, pocket knife made of platinum, Mövenpick ice cream, tailor-made billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy bears side by side.
The public could buy tickets for 30 Euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt painting made of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course Russians are more interested in Klimper clippers."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, millionaires' envoys, or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought it.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said that his company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer needs, said he had sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, each of which is equal to chain-arm tyres, for $55,000.
He showed a reporter a car tire developed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with coloured Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-seater.
"The Russian millionaire who wants to have ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium will not necessarily ride on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll keep it in his 30 or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local property prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There's more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four British-style red telephone booths, packed with mountains of false million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed out 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaires' fair.
Passersby stopped to throw around the piles of money, mobile phone photos as they lean back in the middle of the spare wealth, let friends snap, or just take in a few million.
"Look, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Fake operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving Ronald Livingston saw through the big glass window of the Just a Little Healthier Restaurant here and watched an ambulance stop at the white Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the medical coroner's van approaching," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The authorities learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon that the police did not identify and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, the results of which could not be available for weeks, will help shed light on a mysterious death that has sent a grief from the leadership of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and persistent," said Mr. McCarthy about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pit bull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the alcohol control commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson for the Prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon of November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the ground.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, nobody opened the door to Ms Castro's house, where a wilted rose bush stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark, after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him find his way around provincial and harsh political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that'," he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to a rise in world stock markets
The stocks jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic, after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest rate cuts were reinforced by appeasement comments by the U.S. Vice President of the Central Bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Central Bank, said that politics had to respond "flexiblely and pragmatically" to the ongoing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm troubled markets, given signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulences had "partially reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October".
If the increased turbulence persisted, it would increase the possibility of further tightening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The statements also helped calm Wall Street down in the face of further bad news from the US economy, now that US real estate sales reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were underlined by Bear Stearns, the investment bank,’s announcement that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workforce, in a cost reduction measure to offset serious losses from its lost bets in the US mortgage sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader-based S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British defaults.
Germany's index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the resurgence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for a three-month auction of European Central Bank guarantee funds granted to the European Commercial Banks was given to a considerable 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and feed further capital into the money markets in London increased when the three-month "Libor" loan rates for UK banks increased to their highest level since late September, after a continuous increase since November 21st.
England faced with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who's going to be number six for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the election, is here to help Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually filling up with applications for national electoral offices, if not for some part-time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth thug position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and the sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to nail down exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes out of lack of happiness rather than ability.
It is not only in cricket, where selection is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to rise?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same can perhaps be asked in another area, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good qualifications who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricketer, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, figures have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right time if he can take a wicket and a bat must get regular chances on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better last season than, for example, when James Anderson, who seems to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind goes into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for more.
Whether Shah or Bopara is playing at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or maybe it doesn't make much difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, still struggling to consolidate at that time, who made the breakthrough to a major test cricketer and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, is perhaps still underestimated.
Probably Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm after another discussion at today's net meeting at Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 top-notch hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22 years, and an excellent record against turned-on bullets.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the voters as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his beating, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has shovel-wise joie de vivre.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket pitch and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he had recently flipped over a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was get out his vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from a distance, and say with enthusiasm: "Did you see this?".
Bopara is a much better fielder, he skewed his middle tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Perhaps this is the real art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean that Shah might not look good when, as the Ceylon tea set suggests, he's the one who's going to play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas ran out, and others hoping that the city would return to normal.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the paper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be put back at this point in time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the vast Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local US-backed militia had helped drive Al-Qaeda out of its bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been expelled from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had called on his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaeda militias in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said that they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the US troop increase and the growth of local "groups of affected citizens" who were armed and defending their neighbourhoods in cooperation with the American military.
But there was more talk of being forced home by visa problems and dwindling funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed general suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had requested the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis to stop giving visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were driven out of Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have eased.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will fuel sectarian tensions again and conflicts will arise.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education does the Saarlander face the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I explained for the 50th time yesterday to a non-Aarlander that we are not French" - this slogan is the slogan of the smallest state self-ironic on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which ranks fifth in the educational monitor of the Institute of German Economy Cologne (IW).
Thus, the universities already cooperate closely with neighbouring countries from a tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6 percent.
But even the Landeskinder brings the Saarland in above-average number to the universities - many of them without a degree at the Gymnasium.
"The vocational education system is used in Saarland," says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their right to study at a vocational school, meaning that Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination possibilities of vocational and academic training are also comparatively strong.
In terms of population, the provision of dual courses is the second best in Germany.
However, despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we initiated a number of reforms in the general education schools," says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced country-wide comparative tests.
So that the children can learn earlier is the last daycare year free of charge - a model that other federal states are now copying.
Whether pupils' performance will improve in the long term will only be shown in future comparative studies.
At Pisa 2003, the percentage of students at risk decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians expect better.
And foreign language skills at Pisa are not measured to the displeasure of the Saarlanders - in this area one could score points otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbours is mandatory in high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez changes the clocks
In Venezuela the clocks will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez has the timepieces in the South American country turned back by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joker.
According to a new law, according to the Venezuelan Official Journal, clocks are set to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez justified his decision, among other things, on the fact that the United States had imposed the division into time zones to full hours.
Chávez also announced on Wednesday (local time) that a hostage affair had broken off relations with neighboring Colombia.
The left nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained President of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I cannot do this because of my dignity alone," said Chávez, who is pushing forward a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly increase his power in the country.
The cause of the dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which involved the release of hostages.
Uribe had spat in the face of Venezuela with his decision, had criticized Chávez on Sunday.
Chávez is also on everyone's lips in Spain.
A new cell phone ringtone in the country causes a sensation: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
Spain's King Juan Carlos spoke to him, who at the recent Ibero-American summit was annoyed by the constant interludes of the left-wing populist and had driven him over his mouth.
German Threatens 2007 Wage Minus
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are forecast to lose real wages this year.
Experts gave a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could expect in real terms less on the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the VAT increase and the price increases in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Bild" newspaper.
New burdens could also be placed on employees in the case of unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not again be embarrassed to ask the federal government for loans or subsidies, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion in food and petroleum products pushed inflation to the highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere on Earth, Venus is more similar than previously thought: the European "Venus Express" spacecraft has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortices on the poles, as they also occur on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that it is flashing on Venus.
Now the European "Venus Express" probe has provided evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightnings on Venus shoot from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometres, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "prime soup theory", lightning has created life on earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in very early history," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the devil's twin on earth, but it is a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has taken such a completely different development, is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the early 1990s no probe has been on its way specifically to explore this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighboring planet with Earth are greater than initially assumed," the Esa informs.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents on the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers headed by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second-tinted planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, revolves around the sun in just under 225 days.
But it turns much slower around itself: A Venus day lasts 243 earth days.
Although Venus hardly reminds the Earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
On both of them water was collected, which remained on Earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost into space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonate rocks on Earth, it accounts for the majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and has called on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding of the Dalai Lama's reception by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President emphasized, but took Merkel into protection from the accusation that she is pursuing a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
China also knows that," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked by the Union.
Steinmeier had complained, among other things, about the Union's "showcase policy" in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
The Chinese leadership has not only unloaded the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but has also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the Foreign Ministers of both countries, according to the SPIEGEL.
China’s head of government, Wen Jiabao, has now called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge the Dalai Lama’s reception as a mistake.
China rejected the Chinese position when European politicians officially received the Tibetan religious leader, Wen Jiabao affirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns against riots like in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like in France.
Everything had to be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany would not be discharged into violence on the streets, demanded the Federal Minister for the Interior.
Barricades burned, rioters shot at the police with shotguns: After the severe youth riots in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must make sure that social explosives are not built up and discharged into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" published in Hanover.
Not every young person copes with the rapid change in social reality.
As Schäuble said, the Federal Government, the Länder and local authorities were already working hard to reduce problems.
This does not only concern the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam conference, this already shows first successes."
However, it was too early to give a clear warning.
Schäuble also pointed out that in German suburbs there were no urban planning and sociological problems as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, youths had fought heavy street battles with the police over the past nights.
Cars and public buildings also burned in Toulouse.
However, Kenan Kolat, chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, called for greater integration efforts by the Federal Government.
In the face of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany was not as explosive as in France.
However, there was still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate for young people under 25 years of age is "higher than average".
In particular, more training places had to be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany more than in France, "social control takes place in the families".
Many young people with a migrant background also did not want to destroy what their parents built up here.
Kolat said, "But we still have to be careful."
It was important to give young people "quickly the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, it remained largely calm at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in action, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning trash cans and cars.
Since the day before, a team of around 1000 security forces has ensured peace of mind.
The police would go through as long as it was necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
At night on Tuesday, around 80 policemen were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots were inflamed by a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the prosecutor's first findings, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the young people.
In the realm of Angela Cloud
The Chancellor's far-off appearance documents that the content of the coalition is at the end - and that nothing can be expected of her herself.
In which country does this Chancellor actually live?
After their bleak appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was rootless and low in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country that would have to be ruled by her at last.
Angela Merkel rejected the accusation that she was too focused on foreign policy with a very arrogant sentence.
That's provincial, she said, showing that she doesn't want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the Bundestag it has clearly documented for all how much their accusation applies.
There was no concrete interest or even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a high-ranking politician who flees to foreign policy and remains in the approximate position even there.
For example, climate protection: It praises the decisions of Heiligendamm unabated, but does not say how the climate targets are to be achieved in this country.
In general, the self-praise - so much immodestness would have failed the CDU boss two years ago.
Now she clings to the floscles that the upswing is coming to people.
In doing so, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of talking the world into beauty.
But in the realm of Angela Cloud, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of the low-earners?
She's got a few adjuncts left for it.
It is significant how often she promises when it comes to the child supplement.
Merkel needs three runs to bring out a halfway straight sentence.
It stumbles as if on foreign terrain, when it becomes concrete.
Attack Division
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney make a hard fight - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already unloading on the first topic.
He has made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants," Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This, for its part, counters with serious accusations: "I would say that his own house was a port for illegals," Giuliani replies, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of having privately employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to attack: because the Republican base still has no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-winded 30-second videos that Internet users sent in via YouTube are hardly more than a keyword.
"With this kind of isolationism we let Hitler come to power," John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, too, is strongly read by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding", an interrogation method in which drowning is simulated as torture.
However, the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that the main topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq's war and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, the Auditorium applauds.
It shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney, squirming and recanting in front of base and television audiences that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes into a snare when he is asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns in civil for the first time
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani leader Musharraf was sworn in as president.
That concludes eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live in the Presidential Palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed to international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another key requirement is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his swearing-in, Musharraf, according to Prosecutor General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, will lift the state of emergency and thus fulfill another demand of the West.
Last week, the Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with lawyers weighing against him after the imposition of the state of emergency at the beginning of November, rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four more injured in an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock return
Germany's Supergroup of the Seventies once again makes music: The three band members of Harmonia performed their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
On the occasion of the revival, a recording from her great time "Live 1974" appears.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The planned sensation then occurs in the form of three seated gentlemen at the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front of him, his cables and, above all, his buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in the middle of the white shirt with 63 years.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and in possession of laptop and guitar.
On the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, focuses on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally blends into a traditional piece of music.
That doesn't seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia plays music again has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
While one may reveal here: Targeted inquiries revealed that the name was simmering through collective pop memory, but by no means so sustainable, in order to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should not the German also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially since what is misleadingly called Krautrock was more and more common in England and America than in one's own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Life's Work to the survivors of the Cologne group Can in 2003, the hall saw in inquiring German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudation, the wonder knew no limits.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers at concerts like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transfiguration in the stranger is one thing.
Memory is already overwhelmed with harmonia, because the trio existed for only two years and during this time also developed a far less powerful force than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
After that in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and subsequently gained a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, the perhaps most radical German group at the time.
Around 1973 Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as urban fugitives.
Less ideologically than in Commune I, where Roedelius was allowed to plague himself as a nanny.
It's more like being an artist.
It is said that there was also a pennant of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing association in the bulky waste and a name for art.
Some things kept Harmonia from it.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
For as calm and modest the music sounded, the band suffered material hardship.
Collecting rice was not only a matter of self-discovery.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record set of almost 50 people, as someone thinks to remember.
From Rother came the desire to force harmonia and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric-spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flamming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
The Griessemer live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as its own German contribution to lively music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the love parade inventor Dr. Motte.
Which would outline the entire spectrum of the influences of Krautrock on the following pop music.
Harmonia fills the empty space of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's sentence floats with the most bizarre sounds in the hall: "The only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are pictures that show the producer with harmonia in the Bauernstube.
The Legend Formation serves projections of further black-and-white photos of jumbled devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again involved in improvisation.
No longer by attaching microphones to the organ and to the drums to elicit unheard-of sounds from the instruments via self-made effects devices.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in-depth technical tinkerers.
The choir of the house does not change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, sound clouds are coughed and whispered and sung at a beautiful spot with emphase "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music schools (Can), technologies (Kraftwerk) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Anyone who calls "'68!" here is not quite wrong, and Harmonia is not allowed to get out of it now.
Even the most obvious thing is being thoroughly reconsidered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it end?
This can rob your nerves or give you moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
"The Hunting Party" and "Mörderischer Frieden" are two more films about the Balkan War.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and shooting, or they're too touching.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help either.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found again.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because too many nice-important roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism made you want to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter Becomes a Hunted One" (Why do movie titles have to be as long and confused as locomotive driver collective agreements today?).
He provides a wonderfully winking representation: basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become of gere, if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has long been behind his very best times, but who, even as a ruinous monument to his demise, has preserved considerable remnants of the former charm.
But despite this trump card, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Mörderischer Frieden", which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovar snipers, and one of them immediately falls in love with them.
Although it is to be welcomed that the Serbs are not represented here as the sole root of all evils, the TV-flat film loses itself too quickly in shooting and action.
It remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but for it with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" is an example of why there has never been a really good Balkan war movie.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian war criminal "the Fox" could have been a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another scriptwriter (both in Personalunion Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories resemble each other strikingly: Both times small teams go into the forest to accomplish something that the military cannot do and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the run-down cynic with heart when he's introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to insinuate him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
"The Hunting Party" finally goes down the drain when the reporters manage to do what Nato, CIA and all bounty hunters in the world failed to do in five years: catch the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that one would like to refer to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinema logic.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to denounce the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (for once they should agree) not to pursue the persecution too intensively due to secret political agreements.
But the well-meaning and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "I sympathize with the swollen forehead veins, indicating how exhausting it is to be evil".
Films like "The Hunting Party" have just those swellheads, but they indicate how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Iraq movies were Hollywood's big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa movie.
Almost always: When a star is drifting around on the world's trouble spots or minefields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are too close in time.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films will probably still mature - the now considered classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder comes home on two screens in real time, too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robs the scriptwriters of the lack of concern they need to tell good stories.
After all, "being or not being" or "the great dictator" became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you can't be good at making good movies.
Maybe you have to have the sarcastically distanced artist vision of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied, "This is because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in horrible ways and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust picks criticism for Olympic rejection
The mayor's approach to Hamburg's application for the Summer Olympic Games has met with fierce criticism in politics and business.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But von Beust calls for realism in the assessment of opportunities.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, Chief Executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described a waiver as "not good for the business location" on Wednesday.
No other project has recently developed as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the momentum of sport policy would not be able to be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it "which starts from a changed timeline".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund on an application from Munich for the 2018 Winter Games, expected for the beginning of December.
"For us, this preference means that we will not have realistic chances in the period until 2028 that we have envisaged."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreamt out for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements made by Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to take a chance by burying the plans at this point," HSB President Günter Pleß said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application was also in contradiction to the statement of the head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception to the General Assembly of the German University Sports Association.
There von Beust described Hamburg's application for the 2015 Universiade "not as a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD party accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years, because it has placed Olympia on the map and excluded housing," said SPD MEPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD had always demanded integrated planning for the Little Grasbrook for Olympia and later use of housing, the CDU had unilaterally relied on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg had caused a great deal of enthusiasm at the time.
Hamburg, however, had failed at Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Those who combine the terms Sweden and wooden box think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently in Sweden fabricated wooden boxes cast dark shadows on Warhol's catalogue of works.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo boxes listed there are forgeries.
After a few months ago, the Swedish newspaper Expressen raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now come to a sobering result: The six "Brillo boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén gave to the Moderna Museet as a gift in 1995, are copies - and probably also the majority of the approximately one hundred more Brillo boxes of the Stockholm type, which are in circulation on the international art market.
The prehistory is intertwined, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - exhibited hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these were not from Warhol (for cost reasons), but were delivered directly from the Brillo Carton Factory.
They were not works of art, but their role models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably gave permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes that were rightfully entered into the history of art and auctions as authorized original Andy Warhol brollo boxes with the designation "Typ Stockholm".
Some of them have made more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, has examined the six museum-owned Brillo-Boxes as well as three privately owned Swedish houses, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their chipboard plates were first primed and smeared, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the press board with a paint roll without primer - moreover, it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
As early as July, however, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "serious accusations" raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
But since then, there has been an inexorable silence.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have given up hiding in a hotel in Manila, demanding the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters in the hotel.
Government-loyal soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been hiding in the building for hours.
Around half of them were on trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly settle down with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were supposed to guard him, had apparently defected to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops locked the district around the distinguished hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the Scout Rangers elite unit, said that other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption for months.
In 2003, Manila's financial district was already the main venue for the attempted mutiny of some 200 military personnel against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours because of the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.

"We are strengthening our partnership," explained a United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies have created the MSP joint venture to take over the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to satisfy themselves with a 10% share of Freenet and not make use of their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept all options open, in particular to further increase their shareholding in Freenet AG, it said.
Discussions between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
The poker around Freenet, which has been going on for months and is difficult to understand, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.

The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch held 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares so far.
It had now been agreed that Drillisch would contribute around four percent more.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
