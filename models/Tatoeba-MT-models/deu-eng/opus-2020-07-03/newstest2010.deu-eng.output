Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
American President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma, the medal and a check of 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow together with his wife Michelle in the Northwegian metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he visited the Nobel Institute, where he met for the first time with the five committee members who elected him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The presidential couple then planned a meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prestige prize.
He is the fourth President of the United States, but only the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already ordered that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan war when accepting the prize.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he will accept the prize as a President who is currently waging war in two countries.
A few days ago, he stepped up the war effort by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the Gol medal, the diploma and the cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event program will include a banquet with the President and his wife, at which, besides Norway's King and Queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very cautious about the price from the start.
He mentioned, for example, that he had the feeling that he did not deserve the price entirely.
He also repeated several times that the price was not only for him, but for all those who aspire to the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he pointed out that this is for him "call to action".
Nature conservationists accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the citizens' association "Leitmeritz Nature Conservation Community" of blackmail.
In several cases he filed appeals against some construction proceedings last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded from the investors money in his favor, said the Leitmeritz police spokesman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz Nature Conservation Community is Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in custody and he's in prison for up to three years.
Sorting bulk containers in Brno don't smell good
In Prague people can sort the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages you can find the sorting containers again at every step.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the suitable garbage cans.
I do not mean to say that waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Councillors are not sufficiently concerned about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is located in the waste separation in the Jungwaldliga, not only because we as citizens can always dispose of only paper, glass and plastics here in the sorting containers, but above all because of the number of waste bins for such waste.
Have you ever tried to dispose of PET bottles in a collection basket in the centre, for example?
That's art, it takes time and a lot of nerve.
The only place I have found so far by chance is the Moravian Square opposite the Gegengegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegegege
Mr Onderka should not be annoyed by his colleagues, but it seems to me far too little.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is not a honey slug in other parts.
Whole ranks of my friends therefore prefer not to sort the waste at all.
Out of laziness.
It's too far for them to reach the garbage cans.
I'm not surprised.
Even after the celebration, I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on Konicova Street, I didn't see any paint bins in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place when driving a tram.
But the garbage almost ran over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetic probably leaves the Brno socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us throughout the Republic, instead of buying a few more garbage cans and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after searching the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the Left Party, despite the government's view, gave more money to farmers and officials, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, sickness benefits and construction savings.
But also not for the government debt interest or for the international court disputes.
This causes even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the increase in salaries for some groups, they expected the government to borrow money for sensitive expenses, old age pensions or sickness benefits. "This is just a postponement of the problems in the future, mining," says Janota.
The loans pay ever higher interest rates, and you have to refund the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, the treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state enterprise are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for her children.
People don't have to be afraid of the pensions or the sickness allowance, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, they get this money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state treasury, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will thus increase faster and faster, along with costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money to compensate, then the VAT will no longer be sufficient to increase only slightly or to reduce the maternity allowance, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
Because of the money transfer in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be re-projected and possibly reduced in price.
At the very most, which is not free.
This means delay or cessation of thirty large buildings, and the creation of Europe's money is also at risk, warns Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The CSSD has proposed that it redeems the outflow of money in a Solomonic way - it attacks the CEZ stock dividends, where the state is the owner of the majority, and from them the money is then distributed into the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never safe and it is by no means an infinite source.
In the last year, 18 billion euros went into the budget from CEZ.
Every year, the dividends pay the environmental damage allowances, fill the pension account, and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit to the Nieveau of 5.7 percent GDP, according to the EU rules.
But this does not end the carnival of the upheavals.
Nearly three billion fell in the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crime or for expenses for court disputes, even for building.
Whether the state can cope without this money is not certain.
It's just gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, we'll have to pay for it anyway, Janota will make it clear.
The minister must then save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already begun two billion project "Staatskasse", which is supposed to enable on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case there would be sanctions, warned Janota.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
For the future, Americans expect a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to press just one button, and Windows Mobile will change Android within a few seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to present, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, as Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware pointed out during the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated the smartphone test pattern to journalists with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, which ran parallel to the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware is working together with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and the devices are expected to reach the customer in 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains torments hotel owners
Scneelose slopes worry not only the Krkonoše inhabitants.
The lack of snow also deters people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore in Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but in the meantime they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
Who wants the New Year's Eve stay in the spindle mill exactly according to his ideas, should no longer hesitate with the order.
If you prefer saving and where the quality of your stay comes in second place, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will try to sell them for a while, but then they too will have to give in and go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, Jandura estimated.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not sold out yet.
In our offer about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, led by the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer New Year's Eve in Giant Mountains, but there are fewer free places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest for winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in the Krkonoše Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
Should the slopes be snowed out within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and slightly better than last year, the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou manage to be occupied.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
80 per cent for the New Year's Eve stays is also occupied by the Hotel Omnia at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free for Christmas at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, for which we are currently occupied by about 60 percent.
February is now a little weaker, but at the moment when the snow comes, there is certainly also an interest in stays in the Krkonoše Mountains, led by the director of Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The Krkonoše hotel owners are now waiting for a larger snow shearing.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is rain, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech Weather Agency in Hradec Kralove informed us about the warming.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost strange with what student ardentness Barack Obama, the president with his reputation as the smartest, repeats his predecessor's strategy on the Afghanistan issue, which he himself considered to be the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it about the copy paper from the Bush Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward Way" without squandering.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea of sending out fresh contingents of troops to Iraq, which was plagued by the civil war, as an "irresponsible and in its conclusions atrocious decision".
However, the following months showed that the Bush strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only possible and very successful, and that today the news about Iraq no longer speaks at all.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, for objectively, he left his successor with a much more grateful initial situation than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
The military once again asked him to increase the contingent of troops, especially the chief commander of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite his subordination habits, severely criticized the squandering shooters in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't come up with a better idea, so he betrayed the general wenist by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the promise for another 5,000, even though he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
Most problematic about the entire Obama strategy is his intention to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years.The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by the contraindication - no one can rely on it and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain only sham buildings behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the complexity of the conditions that complicate the Pakistan and Iran influences even further.
The construction of a "workable state", which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama’s strategy alienated by its voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and now it is on the brink of the explosion.
To believe that the little soldiers, who broke out into the war cry about the "early homecoming", create a miracle here, can only be a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is irresponsibility, because the Taliban will accept this as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans’ willingness to participate in the battles in Afghanistan is running out.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu Kush foothills.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, a very serious question arises for the United States as to whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question needs to be answered during the period when America is moving to the victory withdrawal from Afghanistan after Obama.
However, any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that three years remain until the presidential election, and so there is still enough time left for him to take a different strategy, which would turn out to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive cash bonuses
American Bank Goldman Sachs executives will not receive any bonuses in cash this year.
This was announced by the company, which reacts to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of the money, but they can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from managers if they are overly risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street's premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is aware of the wider direction in which it has to go, led the former banker of the company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after putting aside nearly $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
According to the Reuters agency, the total amount of premium bonuses during this yeara will probably exceed 20 billion dollars despite the measure announced today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries since the start of the financial crisis.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the bankers' bonuses, which exceed 25,000 pounds, with a one-time tax of 50 percent.
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Today in Stockholm, five record women from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf took over this year's Nobel Prizes in the subject categories and for literature.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, was among them.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine together with their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosons.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarification of the ribosome structure and function.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman was awarded a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao for glass fibre research and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention have won this prize, which is the basis of all digital chamberas, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, Nobel Medal and Certificate of Acquisition of the Money Prize.
That is ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the money prize will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his journey, and is also at the head of the country that is conducting two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the struggle for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the castle
On Friday morning President Vaclav Klaus receives the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is thinking about his remaining in the government, because he does not agree with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps Janota's remaining in the cabinet, will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticises the budget.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president's spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday about his remaining in his position.
According to the Budget Act, which is now being signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the Left-Party proposals for the circulation of money and increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages for farmers.
The government has countered the social democracy's proposals to cover up the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party on the one hand and the Government, Klaus and the Right Party, on the other hand, a sharp domestic political dispute has arisen because of which the question mark arises about the further work of the Fischer Official Cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, will virtually liquidate the package of austerity measures imposed by the fishermen's government in the autumn, and that, in their understanding, will put an end to public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the State Budget Act but does not have to, explained today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected for a long time the "serious problem", which is "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is horrifying and that the government should weigh up its further existence.
The ODS deputy chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
Premier Fischer described similar words in the editorial office as "strong statements".
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was horrifying, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, exceeding 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows the world much of the country, of its struggle and victories despite some criticisms that the leading role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sport, race conditions and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by the American Oscar actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela to show him in the Eastwood movie.
Another significant role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby" already represented the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which finally became a slave owner, a fictional US president, and also God in "Evan Allmight", but rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active work in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time that is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how he could speak
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that his people remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who are outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team climbs up to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other aim than to play this role in order to bring it as close as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I noticed when I shook your hand, I took over your energy, it was transferred, and I had the feeling that I knew what you were feeling, he said.
It's important for me to have become another person.
Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players prevailed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the newspaper Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "That was a very good story, a very well-executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
The secret of light about Norway: The Russians tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
Only yesterday, the Russian Ministry of Defence acknowledged that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was not successful again and the rocket called the "Bulava" type, which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality as well as the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence at the rocket test also had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has mostly not been launched at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers one already writes about "Bulava" as about a "rake that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly but shines
This already 13th attempt, went normal at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred.
Probably the engine exploded in the third missile stage.
This time "Bulava" started from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which sailed under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indeterminate flying object over northern paths was actually the damaged "Bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian rocket.
This time, the generality has kept itself against it and claims that one cannot clearly speak of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and the accident affected only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was made without errors, the head of the Ministry of Defense considers only six out of thirteen unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fills the generality with optimism and so it is still claimed that the "Bulava" will fly without any problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic atomic warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
At the age of 51, the legendary defender Vjacislav Fetisov presents himself again in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup owner helps his team CSKA Moscow out in need, and probably already competes in the Friday duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas got hurt, we urgently need another defensive player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergey Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only affect one game.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, performed fellow player Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back on the ice, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford with fifty-one years, winning 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles and he also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also gained success in the NHL, where he twice overwhelmed the Stanley Cup in the Detroit-Dress.
He has been a member of the Sternzimmer since 2001.
Hyundai gave in to the unions. All overtime hours are cancelled
The management of the Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the abolition of all overtime.
Due to frequent overtime, the union announced its willingness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not abandon our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two working shifts would be worked, said Vanek.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The employees will also receive it in hindsight for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they pay the overtime supplement or they can take a replacement holiday on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek explained.
In addition, all employees on the Saturday shift are paid the fare and lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and burning point regarding demands and complaints from trade unionists who stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the lifting of all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk stated.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work two hours of overtime almost every day after the eight-hour shift.
From the signing of the agreement, the willingness to strike will be revoked by the trade unions.
Further negotiations will take place on Friday afternoon between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they would be willing to lift the willingness to strike.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation in the automobile factory became more acute when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management, on the other hand, held that the employees had to make the overtime to meet the automotive supply requirements.
The unionists also called for no sanctions to be imposed on the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday in their Monday strike call.
In the area of overtime, the trade unions call for a minimum reduction in overtime work.
In addition, they are demanding the payment of 5000 kroner this year.
The Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Serial production started at the company in November last year.
By this September about 80,000 vehicles were produced here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works with ́stamped ́ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not work as strongly on common virus variants as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, the drug composition can prolong the patient's life and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus proliferation also results in the development of all resistance viruses, against which no medicinal products are more effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSGT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to how to deal with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances called metalocarborans act on the protein that is responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus proliferation in a way other than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new ́improved ́ compounds, which were prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-faceted cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Secret and persistent virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus splinter caused by HIV protease, no mature infection virus particles would emerge.
When we switch off HIV protease, we also switch off the proliferation of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed further.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the test tube, including their resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as with the clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants, against which the used drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formation, makes metalocarborans interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fighting over budget. ODS started on Fischer, who resists himself
The president of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "grey" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should in his opinion consider its further existence.
The Prime Minister described the statement of the ODS as "strong pronouncements".
There's supposed to be time for analysis.
The Deputy ODS Chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to fighting the rising deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the left of Parliament.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, as Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the budget for 2010, but with Link Party amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has countered the social democracy's proposals to cover up the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS left the Chamber before the vote, so it complied with the government's wish, because the modified budget is only a less bad version of the budget provisional. Frase not clear
Disappointment and futility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his disappointment and a sense of futility, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer has argued that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign in case the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to Czech television, Janota has signed up to the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
In doing so, he indicated that he was considering his remaining in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the negotiation of the budget.
According to Necas, the nominees of Social Democracy (CSSD), who had enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with this in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sickness benefits and pensions, or new legislation on employment.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make any mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the USA.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in a deputy position who are committed to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides not to fight the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he is based on the majority of the left currently in Parliament".
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that is up to date, then I will deal with it, said defence minister Martin Bartak, who was nominated by the citizens' democrats, to the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council in the afternoon.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote in Parliament on Wednesday against the modified budget if the Prime Minister explicitly asked the MEPs to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not appear to be orphans, we are not small children, so he then responded to the question whether the ODS was not pushed back at the political negotiation on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice would be missing.
Already when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the coming months everything would be about Bolshevization of Parliament and destruction, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will travel for about the same fare.
The Czech Railway will end or restrict some less busy express and local trains from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared with today.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer fares, will not be changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area have several connections to the capital, while the railway is using Pendolino trains for this route.
The express train will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less rapid trains will also travel on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, as a matter of principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The biggest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
There are also two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and to a few days a week the operation of some express trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, which can be opened thanks to the electrification of the railway from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run at two hours.
With the Pendolino passengers can no longer travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's regional railway bill: 200 million increase
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, the railway receives four billion kroner to pay the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, exactly as this year. The local trains supply the districts, in total they pay eight billion kroner in the next year, whereby the state shoots up three billion kroner.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the express trains, the railway has concluded a ten-year contract, until now the contract has only been concluded for one year.
The railway praises the system, and perhaps that is why it has not resorted to increasing prices for the vast majority of tickets.
There are only changes for one-day network tickets CD Net and for cheap internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven stick, until now it was uniform for travel between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine millitants arrest more than 50 people, the children were released.
Today, Millitante kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary school students and their teachers.
This was mentioned by the AFP Agency, which initially only informed about 65 kidnapped persons.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millitants allegedly used the hostages as a living shield when fleeing the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to release the remaining hostage.
According to the agency AFP, the millitants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the arms faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local famillien clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right of stand was imposed for the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which coincided with the election to the governorship, were 30 journalists.
Because of suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this South Filipino province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
But they reopened the peace negotiations with the Phillippin government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will be released in the American cinemas "Invictus: the Unbeaten", which includes part of the life story of former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly chosen by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
With the cinema launch of the film, reactions from critics as well as the public become loud.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize together with de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it comes to the cinemas at a time when South Africa is on the one hand culminating the preparations for the World Cup, but at the same time the media are shaking the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are consistently positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the leading roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of the new film in his own words.
I have dreamt of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I could - as they say - receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good that we can remember Mandela's personality and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects everyone, he added.
In the Rugby National Team Dress
The film is based on the novel by British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the Role of the Enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people portrays the South African defender of human rights within his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman tries throughout the film to bring together two racial groups and, since year and day, each other, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays in the South African national rugby dress on the World Cup field, which South Africa won at the time.
For entering the lawn in dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations fourteen years ago, mainly from the white audience and has thus won the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may have brought people together to form a single nation, led rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve, that will only become apparent.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, as, for example, in a recent interview for LN rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million kroner
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the Ceps company in the switchgear at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the Usti nad Labem district fire brigade, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened in the fire.
Originally the fire brigade wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishers.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the safety of the management system according to the company spokesman, Pavla Mandova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million kroner, more precisely the damage will only be quantified after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new transformer according to Mandova.
For more than 10 years, nothing similar has happened to Ceps; mistakes of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted according to the spokesperson of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, and the fire of the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as the sole operator of the pipeline system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovated and develops 39 switchgear with 67 transformers, which transmits the electrical energy in the distribution system and line line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura charges charges of slander against three heads of CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today charges three social-democratic leaders for slander.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint is related to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, but we have submitted the offer only about the extent as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech Railways, because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways that were completed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he argued that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the lawsuit to continue the medial show of Jancura, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that it will also become clear on this matter that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses lying and untrue arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he has invested several million kroner in advertising, which will point to the detrimental step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed on regional rail transport with the Czech Railways and did not tender for the contract at a height of around 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, he was also threatened by a member of the CSSD because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts.
The only threat was if we didn't give up the fact that we could also lose bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, said Jancura to the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococci free and voluntary
Infection against pneumococci changes the habit from January.
It is said to be the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But voices are already making their voice heard that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci culminate.
The Institute of Medicine already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that health insurance companies have to pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not received a dose of vaccine.
If you have already started vaccination in the past year or earlier, you will also have to pay for further vaccination yourself.
The first dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th months of life of the child.
A quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci last year.
The parents paid 1600 kroner and more for a dose.
Vaccination of the youngest children requires four doses.
On the whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance funds spend 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year on the doses.
However, they save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all area vaccinations of children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear infection, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill up to 28 children up to 10 years of age per year in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococci was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, this is to be paid by insurance companies and voluntary.
For example, Rudolf Kalovsky, head of the Nahlas Citizens' Association, mentioned that the mandatory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very pleased with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in achieving at least that.
I think that's the way we need to go now, Kalovsky said.
The Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment, we are not considering this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
Hana Cabrnochova, chairman of the Association of Pediatricians, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children had been vaccinated, one could think about the reduction in the number of re-vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one," says Cabrnochova, however.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococci from next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in that it is the first area vaccination to be paid by health insurance and not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, thus saving them for further treatment, explains Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is linked to a concern of the practical pediatricians concerning the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be bought by the insurance companies and the doctors should receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued by the state to them.
However, some MEPs feared that insurance could "carry out the money from health insurance" in this way.
That is why doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until insurance companies pay them.
According to estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum.
According to Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings in his vehicle with a trailer.
They say Frank Frazetta Jr. and another man used an excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
According to the Associated Press news agency, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior might have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police affidavit, that Frazetta Junior was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum by all means to bring all the paintings into a camp."
The agency announced that Frank Frazetta Senior had denied any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary budget report against the criticisms of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
Conservatives said that Alistair Darling had "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing decisions out until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Treasury was also bombarded for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% capping of public wage settlements for 2011.
Social security institutions
The unions have protested that low-wage recipients will be punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned of imminent "problems".
The increase in social security - to about £3 billion a year - has upset the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on the economic upturn.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than £20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE PREVIOUS ETAT REPORT
Increase in social security by a further 0.5% from April 2011
Economic decline this year by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
1 percent increase in corporation tax for small enterprises rejected
Tax reductions for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in public pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Treasury, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer by £90 a year and someone with £40,000 a year will be poorer by £190, while a person with an annual income of £10,000 will be richer by £110.
Ministers said their objective of halving the deficit by 2013 was "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would come from the 5% of top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax increases and expenditure cuts outlined would be "a drop in the ocean" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big figures. They will bring us the deficit halving and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour’s predictions of future economic growth – affecting the size of new debt and the speed of deficit reduction – were called into question after the Treasury Chancellor was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year – much more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while debt would be £3 billion higher than previously estimated.
Missed opportunity
Conservatives who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour's "debt crisis" said that the planned indebtedness of £789 billion over the next six years is unsustainable.
They added that ministers have failed to present a credible plan of how to repay this and "cynic" about difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place in June 2010 at the latest.
"They didn't say anything about what they were going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this and they let them pass by."
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police should be protected from future cuts, unlike the Conservative proposals, which see deficit capping coming faster and sooner.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by tax increases and spending cuts is being used to cover next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand."
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that at the time of the announcements – such as the above inflation adjustment for some invalidity pensions next April – some would expose the Chancellor of the Treasury to the accusation of winning votes, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra assistance when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler budget"
Although ministers did not disclose budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only come to fruition in the medium term.
The recognized Institute of Tax Investigations said that the figures of the Chancellor of the Treasury would mean substantial reductions in many areas, possibly also in the future in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his director Robert Chote.
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, an accountant at the Deloitte audit firm.
"This was just the hollow preliminary budget report.
FBI Investigates "Fighting of US Citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens for suspected extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Punjab province, and the American embassy in Pakistan informed the BBC.
The FBI said it's being investigated if they're the same men who've been reported missing in Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be Pakistani, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are accused of and under what circumstances they are held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesman Katherine Schweitt said the agency was informed of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We're working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if it's actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house owned by the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had previously been interested in the house and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
The news agency Reuters reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US must "closer cooperate with Afghanistan and Pakistan in eradicating the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "abuses" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, human rights in Iran is still as bad as it has been in the past 20 years.
The report details "disuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report stated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said that he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens were killed, leading to the biggest street protests since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
Dozens were sentenced to prison and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Detention Centre.
But since then there has been no tolerance for criticism on the part of the authorities, said our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was charged with "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election results.
"They often slapped me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, informed Amnesty.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuses have taken place.
Amnesty also referred to the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained in a container in a detention centre in Kahrizak for more than eight weeks with 75 others.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the post-election riots and the government's response to them, but according to Amnesty, the mandates and power of these bodies were unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competition runway.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prizes.
On the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill park there was a short ski jump at the beginning of a 100 meter long slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that glitter below.
He added, "There are some of the country's best skiers and snowboarders here - some real talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best tricks or tricks performed on the hillside.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam Be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted in favour of a construction ban on minarettes and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe's most declared secularised societies — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (2006), an elegant and well-arguing study of a dispute that divided the country over a decade and a half and the effects of which can still be seen today.
Bowen's latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic freedom".
He is a good listener, he reflects debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or city hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, which constitute daily life, quite unlike the political dramas that occupy the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists whom Bowen interviewed are mostly divided with their Salafi counterparts – advocates of purist Sunni Islam, which is related to Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn had to make their historical compromise with secular republicanism.
He sees a "enhancing of value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The most desolate outlook in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes it melts at alarming speed and takes life with it that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have recently gone into the open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Accompanied by the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in hunting the polar bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign at sea, who only fought with the rifle butt of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically own one millionth of the life of a wild animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore became quite green from the algae that grow in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor sledging Inuit use powerful assault rifles to hunt down their prey.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
But this is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneer journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century gave the first impression of the swirling of the pack ice.
In the Cold War, submarines were driven under the shifting ridges.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale application of probes on icebergs, but much is still achieved by intrepid people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the strange, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater troughs compressed when freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic miracles in the ice, everyone is threatened by the passing of summer ice, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... that could be us"
Marines were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths in Arlington
Chief De'Angello Robinson travelled seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other naval infantrymen who took the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they followed.
In a few months, from where we're being brought back, that could be us, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd wish someone would do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip every year, stop in different cities along the way to carry out events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other countries.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths on the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery, in areas on the Pentagon, on the tombs of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than 150,000 dollars for the purchase and transport of wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of returning something to those who made sacrifices.
She said that this is a small contribution to helping civilians support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War as a goal, since these are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children playing and couples holding hands as they carried the fresh pine branches to the graying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red bow attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals cried open, others prayed, and families and friends held together in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black-and-white maps, which had been put in the damp mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears before her son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of naval infantry sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been around for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractor of the U.S. government arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor from the U.S. government who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the State Department on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials from the US interest group in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on December 5th.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the charge of "hazard".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tensions between the Communist government of the Castro Brotherhood in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a "slow" rapprochement to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new US policy is important for the United States to provide a return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought after products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is 15 dollars per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are actually used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute telephone call would cost a day's pay.
Internet use on the island is extremely restricted.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesperson of the U.S. representation in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the release of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", who recently published a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, same Cuba", an allusion to the establishment of Raul Castro as the leader of the country that replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often arrested, sentenced and detained within a day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, precisely at the time when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials reveal plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, saying that they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after finding them, because one of them had made YouTube comments on the Internet video page approving terrorist attacks.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after her arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, which is home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was informed of the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations in order to gain access to the Al Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani prison authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underscores the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and possibly even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence service has made it a matter of utmost urgency to house human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as porters who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are being subjected to a special test by A Qaeda, analysts said.
However, because of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the USA, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they allow access, because the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to get someone into these groups, what better way could you go than following the recruitment model that so many have followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators call for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded bolder action on climate protection from negotiators in the city's Bella Congress Centre.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosives near some government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened during the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists with banners wandered through the city where "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish said "The Earth says "Enough."
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, her mother's country of birth, make her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country is facing due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That is part of the motivation why I decided to take part in the big demonstration - to pass on the word and appeal to the world leaders to reach a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it needs to be done now and there is no way around it anymore.
The police stopped the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited at demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named because he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing lit several explosive devices near the Copenhagen main canal, which is close to several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they began as flares, but then followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest apparently did not reach the consciousness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiators.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of."
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it depended on the individual's perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disturb the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent race gap
The testimony on mathematics performance last week was welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the country’s high-performance schools, the evidence shows that the fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what is included in the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both at local and national levels.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their Afro-American peers rose only by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American eight-graders remained basically the same, falling around a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap separating white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district was 60 scales (262 to 202).
And although the score reached by children from both groups has increased in this period of time, the difference has barely decreased with 58 points now.
Some of the district's educational supporters expressed concern last week that the results, which were celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were largely driven by white students, who are already powerful children anyway.
This suggests that we have raised the overall ranking by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group advocating educational equality in Washington D.C..
I am not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points, said Democratic Washington City Councillor, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of exam scores is that the city's middle schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what scares me is that we don't spend nearly the time and energy we need to use for our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the poor students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson reading system, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and middle school who did not master basic literacy skills at the beginning of their school career and who are significantly behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games from kindergarten to sixth grade and lifelike experiences, was brought to Washington under the former senior school inspector Clifford Janey and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progresses reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to make the best measures available to students below the grade level, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performing schools needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor of Education at the University of California at Berkeley, who is investigating urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could give rise to political repercussions which are working against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, is that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to make sure we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighbourhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a Newark school inspector, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements to closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, in order to compete with the charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to about 200 days in order to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement last year with his teachers' union over 185 days a year, which he regards as a "significant milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The coach reaches Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, steps out and blinks a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents barely finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was recovered in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight-graders of the group, who explore Gettysburg, where lessons cost 38,690 dollars a year, was rather that of an awe-inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I will be here soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the Führer announced that they had now entered the building of science.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told the low professor-to-student ratio of the school.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully received the intended message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born to Hispanic immigrants in the United States who do not end high school or become pregnant as teenagers, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to get into the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" of Hispanics completes college – which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the USA without having graduated from high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who study powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for school and an intrinsic drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counselling programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like her to get to college, especially if these efforts persist over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure at some point will not solve the problem either, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from preschool to high school.
The federal program that Gracielas College Tour funded is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - a gang up - and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of whom more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to re-establish its damaged infrastructure at two auctions closed on Saturday.
The ten contracts signed with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralysed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that made a bid has cut short.
Two American companies were able to enter into contracts for auctioned fields in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil multinationals at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war, and instead of US companies, Asians and Europeans are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no more offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability through the withdrawal of the US military, have likely prevented American oil companies, analysts said, from becoming more involved in Iraq, which has the world's third largest proven crude oil reserves.
US companies have been disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to enter into contracts with the ministry.
Major US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have close relations with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been on hand with technical advice in recent years, have gone blank.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman of the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the greats of the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to compete with its competitors and fulfil its obligations to Iraq.
Companies preselected for bids made bids, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil that the Ministry was willing to pay in order to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of Al Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan
In an obvious US missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top Al Qaeda deployment planner is said to have been killed this week, according to US counter-terrorism officials on Friday.
This, if confirmed, would be the second fatal attack on a senior terrorist operative this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were reported to have been killed by a number of rockets, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region, that hit their vehicle near Miran Shah in northern Waziristan province on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civilian intelligence agency official from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of being militants ran to the site and quickly took all that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism led to indeterminate evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of Al Qaeda, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies all over the world, noticed a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate nature of the US air raids on Pakistani soil.
If one assumes its central role as given, this also included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and put them into operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somali quickly rose in the Al Qaeda hierarchy and maintained best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this does not reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading al-Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September when Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed in a similar attack.
The rate of attacks by CIA drones has declined from an average of six operations per month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability and at the same time brutally kill suspected informants, reported the site.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul to resign
Kai Eide, the UN's leading envoy to Afghanistan, said on Friday that he would resign from office in March, ending a stormy term clouded by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
The Obama administration took the oath to leave the country when it decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concern that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule, which is due to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the building of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help in the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign from office, but only fulfilled an agreement made with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now forward so that he has time to provide for a replacement.
What I said was that he better start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
Ban has started to search for a replacement according to UN representatives.
The UN representatives say that he considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eid's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - who was fired - "have undoubtedly caused damage to the mission because there was already a great deal of scepticism about international interference in the election."
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of the American-led armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to recruit more personnel from the United States and other Western countries who are donating to the Afghan mission, saying that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN recruitment regulations have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I could only hire one person.
This is catastrophic and must not go on like this.
US Defense Minister Gates: Iran Must Expect Additional Sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in talks about his nuclear plans.
During a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of approximately 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and played down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good options for choice, he said in answer to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things on my mind is, if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, the unpredictability of war."
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed to "convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer tremendously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined European leaders in warning that if Iran does not comply with the demands of the UN Security Council and its Atomic Energy Agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, it will have to face "credible" consequences.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology is to be gained only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October Iran said that it would resume talks to restrict its nuclear program and renounce a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since that time -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to commit to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international community standing in the way of some of the proposals it had already approved at the beginning of October has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way that they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set the deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals on 31 Dec before pursuing other options, including those once called "impressive sanctions" by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In a statement issued in New York, Iran's representation at the United Nations condemned what it called Thursday's "undeclared and unsubstantiated assertions" of some Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities, saying that they are prepared to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "in order to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent US plans from delaying the US military force from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel Kurdish concerns about the imminent withdrawal of troops. US representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government,: "We will maintain your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A change in the course of aging China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "One more baby means one more grave."
They learned these lessons so well that when government officials in Shanghai, who, due to the low birth rate and the ageing population, suddenly started to change course this summer and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: "No way."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There's nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, spoiled single children, affectionately called "little emperors", a population crisis in the country is rising.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN
Department of Population Affairs, while the number of population groups from 60 years and older in 2020 is set to increase from 16.7 percent of the population to 31.1 percent by 2050, well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with an educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and olders accounted for almost 22 percent of the reported residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai Urban Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples of childbearing age need to have babies to "help reduce the ratio of older populations and alleviate the labour shortages of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
Gradual relaxation
Inscribed in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial order introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Married couples who violate this policy have to face enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their jobs.
Chinese state representatives have attributed it to this policy that the critical use of natural land resources could be avoided, while human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of politics.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to abort.
Many couples also had sex - selective abortions, creating an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude to one-child politics.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many harsh slogans was reduced.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University's Institute of Population Research, said that government officials recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with whom a partner is an only child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines describing in detail who would be eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent out municipal employees and family planning volunteers to visit couples at home and to put leaflets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice to those with more than one child.
The reaction was not very encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing Response
Although officials from a rural small town in the outdoor areas of Shanghai said that there was an upswing in the applications of couples who wanted a second child after the launch of the campaign, the urban districts did not report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, as an example, only four to five applications are still received per month.
Defrauded Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the expected number of births in the city in 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai Caolu Township, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give their first one the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that this was legally permitted.
But, like many Chinese, they have only a small health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we're being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for her hesitation.
Wang, the head of staff, said she only wanted a child because she was also an only child. "We were the center of the family and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and do not really want to do so."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it bluntly.
For middle-class parents with a double career, which lowers the birth rate, he said, it's about being successful and for that, you have to be selfish.
The 20 to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalist experiment, and they do not want a life like this for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you already have to have a CV for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group designs emission reduction plan
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations -- has again focused on Friday with the publication of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrial nations shouldering the greatest burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, has highlighted both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that runs out of time, as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrialised and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how high should be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would share.
According to John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington, the process is given a great deal of flexibility.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, called "the big picture".
It shows the outline of a possible agreement in which developed nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020 compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent in the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the talks on Friday a boost through its commitment to provide US$3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change, from the mastery of floods and droughts to the prevention of deforestation.
Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks, which had determined the conversations last week.
The US Climate Special Representative Todd Stern has rejected formulations that require binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if they are not financed by industrialised nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration is going a tougher line with China than representatives of the Bush administration less than two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging economies getting up and taking action, says Stern, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern issued his statement an hour after the statement by Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei, saying that the leading American climate negotiator either lacked "reason" or was "highly irresponsible" of him, saying earlier this week that the United States would not help China financially to master global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake has broken out within the industrialized nations as well as between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle refers equally to saving individual economies, as well as saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting for their corresponding commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the big powers are struggling to find out who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have gone over to act more aggressively to hold the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, according to Ulate, who is also working as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change stated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will, at best, lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page draft contract early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states is exerting "political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand measures from the emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks were given a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding questions had to be resolved before the government leaders arrived in order to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice-Minister, got off their planes and raced through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to stake out claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The mere size of the gathering -- 13,000 people go in and out every day at the congress center, guitar-playing activists do night-time shows that make fun of the countries that they think are betraying and selling, and draft contracts are passed on by hand instead of by email -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is only just growing: almost all important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy of the Conservation International organization.
The heavyweights are coming.
Great Britain's first 225 km/h train redefines Monday's feeling
Monday morning at 5 a.m., a whistle will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that is a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will travel 225 km/h from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and cover 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin commuter service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will eventually connect to an international rail network faster and more reliable trains and connect the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuting cities, working hours would be radically reduced, and switching from aircraft and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage could still put the brakes on British high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis will present the report on December 30, according to the Times.
This gives it a detailed map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to connect London with the West Midlands will pass urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is disputed, with a five-metre margin.
In the open terrain, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, north-facing high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed line would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the journey time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to travel the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today's slightly over an hour.
The drafts would allow trains to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400 meters of long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can travel on it.
Up to 18 trains per hour could operate on the London-Birmingham line.
This, in turn, would mean that there would be a final stop in London where 20,000 travellers could be handled per hour.
Given the geographical constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be taken after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed lines to existing lines in the north of Birmingham, thus continuing to travel more than three hours between London and Scotland.
This is seen as a crucial key point to ensure a change from aircraft to rail, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay for mortgage for 75,000 pounds of a conservative orangery
Alan Duncan, the Conservative leader, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had built in his home in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron because he complained that members of the House of Commons had to live on lean rations, increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak-timbered plant on his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer with the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The people in charge of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is carrying out a review of the expenses of the members of the House of Commons. Last night Duncan said that the applications could not have been "more clean or understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-story house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control center of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he cultivated a conservatory, which is called "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glasshouse for entertainment".
Even during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts, Duncan was not asked by the Standards and Privileges Committee to comment on the increased borrowing.
The Committee acquitted him of the breach of the rules last month, following an investigation of his expenditure.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London home to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election as a Member of Parliament.
This week, documents published show that Duncan received approximately 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) a month as a mortgage interest refund by March last year.
In April, his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the total increase served to finance the borrowing of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it is still standing.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim his right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month this May.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending scandal that members of parliament would live on "poor rations".
"In essence, working for the state means living on lean rations and being treated like S*****e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden, and I claim a small portion, measured by what is heard.
And I could have claimed all the fucking money, but I don't."
The MP, a millionaire from his earlier career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May because of his expenses when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before he had clarified with the Fees Office that this could be "considered an exaggerated demand".
As a protest in Duncan's lawn, an activist dug a hole in the form of a pound sign after it became known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was questioned last night about the raised mortgage, Duncan said, "This had been approved by the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg to increase the value."
He added, "There is no debate about evading and squeezing or bending the rules or anything like that.
Everything is perfectly manageable and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer."
Come all you believers to admire Brighton's beach hut Advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content as an interactive Advent calendar for the winter months.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that inspires spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas carols as a theme.
The event started on 1 December and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free mulled wine and traditional mint pies, pastries filled with dried fruit.
The so far selected Christmas carols are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer clergyman of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and organize inspiring celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantasticly creative and lively place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people around the world and in Copenhagen on Saturday demonstrated to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, where the police have taken several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations climate conference, which was to lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish Chair of the Climate Change Conference, the growing global climate mobilisation is contributing to this, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure would be very high in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, all dressed in black, smashed showcases with cobblestones and hammers, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Anti-terror police intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your assessment, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, of these extremely violent splinter groups, who have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in eastern France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested "without distinction", and has underlined that about a hundred of you "were still held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in sitting position.
The rather peaceful train has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators have arrived from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky-blue raincoats, have made a first casserole in the morning in Copenhagen, as you have followed the call of Earth's friends to make "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a reparation of ecological guilt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filippin activist of Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot go on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, as has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN agreement, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organizations.
Euro MP José Bové, the figure of the globalization critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, has given the start to the demonstrations.
According to the organisers, about 50,000 people have taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila there were several hundreds of people, mostly students, who marched in red and hoisted bandanas, in which you boasted the solar energy.
In Hong Kong, or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, demonstrations of several hundred demonstrators took place to demand a vigorous approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the 350 network have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseilles (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia has denounced that this is a "strike".
Abkhazia elected his president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilissi denounced the "strike".
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory that was recognized by Russia.
The polling stations are closed at 17:00 GMT.
Voter turnout was around 58% a few hours before the polling station closed, according to the Abkhaz electoral commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous President, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under total Russian occupation, his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze, has declared.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating itself from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with thousands of people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has declared Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to a polling station in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Big signs on which Bagapch can be seen alongside the Russian President and the Head of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, that is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the conduct of the elections.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to Moscow's support, especially with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazian independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, for its part, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements made with Moscow the previous year, as the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia control of the railroad for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated throughout the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, ready for action at all times, has arrested about 700 people on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which receives delegates from 193 countries who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the centre and did not try to invade.
A stage was set up to welcome the speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of demonstrators, all dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to smash windows, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Anti-terror police immediately surrounded you and intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent factions that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
Towards evening, during the incidents in which, according to the police, about twenty people were temporarily arrested, a police officer suffered injury from a cobblestone on his chin. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said the spokesman for the police, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the police were circling in the air.
Most demonstrators arriving by train or by their own vehicle from German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky-blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are going out on the streets to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't tell each other any more: we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that dry up, there are watercourses through which you can walk, which was never the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalist movement has approached environmental organizations.
French MEP and globalization critic José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer any difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed in red with bandanas, made advertisements for solar energy in front of the Philippine capital’s municipal administration.
Hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in Hong Kong and Djakarta in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people joined forces during the demonstrations organized by the "Network of 350", particularly in Paris, Marseilles in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the Lycées.
National Minister of Education Luc Chatel explained in an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" that the subjects geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the Lycées, even if they are not taught in the terminal (12th school year).
"The pupils of the Première (11th school year) now have every four hours per week and the same program," Mr. Chatel confirms.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but on the whole a concentration of "the best student."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific profile," he continued. He stressed: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who have been outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lycees."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that almost seven out of ten French (69%) criticize the state project of removing compulsory teaching in history and geography at Terminale S (12th academic year with a scientific profile), and many teachers and intellectuals also criticised this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of the Terminale S programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which in their opinion is a victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that they were subject to a subject-related aptitude test in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and to an admission examination at the end of the year, during which their teaching skills were examined.
In addition, they conduct internships during the year in the M2 and then teach one year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He continued: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance test, you will reach even more hours that you have spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The minister finally stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed once again that he wanted to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, faced on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
According to a journalist from the AFP, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts each turn to the audience for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organisers of this day, explained that one would like to do something to reach people and make them feel like they want to know more. The name of this event goes back to the name given by the students to fishing in the school's basin.
"Among the experts, around twenty participants in the discussion were selected, also according to their charisma," he specified.
"One can talk about global warming for hours, but the core goals can also be set out in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke freely in front of about 50 people only with the help of foils.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the audience may conclude that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be available online on the school page from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Late payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the unions of prison officials called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtime paid for budgetary reasons postponed until January were paid before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd union of prison officials ("FO-Pénitentiaire"), called on the employees who have no service to demonstrate and block them in front of the prison on Tuesday morning in order to draw attention to the "theft of what they deserve".
The 3rd union of prison officials ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "to unite in a strong mobilization in the various prisons" on which the non-payment of overtime, night allowances and Sunday and holiday allowances incurred in October in December becomes a "harmful and unacceptable" burnt market.
The first union of prison officials, the Autonomous Federal Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The head of the prison and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime had risen sharply in 2009 and not all had been included in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
The Ministry of Justice announced in the evening that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of prison officials guaranteeing that payment would be made next month.
"I know very well about the efforts of the staff to keep our prison system functional and modern", the Minister of Justice informs in this letter.
"I have instructed the head of the prison to take immediate action so that such a situation, which has arisen due to a lack of assessment of the resulting overtime, will not be repeated in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
Thus, the December wage is low, except for the management staff, who benefit from high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains, for which the "household constraints" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade union FO in Marseille is outraged and announces to boycott "all meetings and convocations" up to new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and public holidays, if the hours of October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime," the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne threatens.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being imposed on us without more staff being hired, the attempt to enrich the staff's funds is more than inappropriate," said the Bordeaux CGT union.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, states the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that he always gives Christmas better gifts than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, told TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he always gives better gifts than he gets himself.
On a special show that was broadcast on Sunday evening via ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be part of the game.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," Michelle Obama affirms, adding that the dog of course also gets a gift.
Michelle Obama definitely rejected her husband's claims on the quality of the gifts. "I gave you beautiful gifts last year," she teases the president.
"So, please," he conjured her scoldingly and pointed to the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour broadcast in a casual atmosphere with the well-known TV presenter Barack Obama had so vehemently supported during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-speed bicycle and a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father visited us one Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"Not until much later in my life did I understand that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady, for her part, remembered her doll's house.
"I didn't know at all how to order the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL confirmed that he was transferred to artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was once again operated in Los Angeles for serious "damage" after surgery in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was again operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, after the American doctors found "damage as a result of the operation of a disc incident" he had suffered in Paris on November 26th, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damages would have required a new operation.
However, the singer's production company wanted to make it clear that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
However, only after 48 hours did RTL have a little more certainty about the patient's condition than he opened his eyes, added.
At the request of AFP, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources it emerges" that after his first operation in Paris "no Dränage" was laid.
The rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a herniated disc.
The surgery planned for several days was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had treated many stars.
This was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday evening.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the procedure.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, felt to RTL on Thursday that his friend was walking through a "deep valley". However, he assured that one had to "do not worry" about the rock musician, since he was "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was bullshit to sit on an airplane for 12 hours after such an operation, that's not going to happen," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer Jean-Claude Camus confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics" and that "the infection is contained".
Mr Camus also explained that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not felt any particular concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the singer's health had grown ever since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, the general surprise was that Johnny Hallyday had a "small colorectal cancer surgery", resulting in a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour as planned.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists have not escaped that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the people around him had to deny another hospital admission.
Euro-2009/Shortway: First place for Bousquet over his favourite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on Thursday about his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, on which polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while one had expected a real record flood.
A record was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 m positions of men.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to grab the world record in the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the large basin (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman asserted himself in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere on an international level.
Bousquet defeated the Croats Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russians Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater things, and in this case, I said, if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record, did not pay off in the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has prevailed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't win a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," explained Biedermann.
USA : Burial plate at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman tombstone, which appeared to the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated on Thursday to be 1.5 million US dollars above its value, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the third century AD and has always been valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysus are depicted in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," explained Florent Heintz, vice president for the sale of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday opposite the AFP.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered the most so far," says Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy to AFP.
Emile Zola's discovery of this piece of marble goes back a long way.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then she appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom at her Paris hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
While searching the Louvre's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's escape attempt from Honduras to Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic territory to be no longer compatible after this escort by the coup government had rejected it as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place at night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, declared Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authorities, the plane, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer of M. Zelaya, had returned to its place of departure.
The coup government wanted to force M. Zelaya to "abdicate" and ask for political asylum under his guidance abroad.
The overthrown president refused, however, since he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcome, acting head of state.
The coup regime "had suffered another failure by trying to get me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to resign," said M. Zelaya to Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has frequently spoken out since the beginning of the political crisis, which has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the overthrown president, who had fled to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, with a few chords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for escort, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, since it does not include a request for asylum, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Interior Minister of the coup government, declared to the Honduran radio HRN.
I do not seek asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had stressed, would only be undertaken as President of the Honduran people.
On Wednesday, the rumors of Mr. Zelaya's departure had mobilized the supporters of the overthrown president, who had set out for the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, and the military there had intensified its efforts.
The Brazilian foreign minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal nature of this government in the face of international norms.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, on the day of the referendum he organized in preparation for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
He had surprisingly returned from exile in Costa Rica on 21 September and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves, he is imprisoned for treason, which he is accused of by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
The coup president Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organising a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina, and Brazil.
Three days later, the Cogress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street on the upswing, the US trade balance nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed with a high on Thursday, the figures from the American trade balance testify to a price recovery of the United States shares and their partners: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, while the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, has risen from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor ́s 500 index was written at 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There is good news from various industries, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial judged.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market focuses only on "half-full glasses", so it moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on the figures of the American trade balance, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States’ trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October compared with September.
By contrast, analysts had expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell from Unternehmensforschung Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States rose against all expectations last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average of new job seekers has fallen "to the low point of the year over the past four weeks," stressed Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market is down.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has risen to 3.482 % compared to the 3.432 % from Tuesday evening, while the profitability of bonds to 30 years to 4.492 % compared to the 4.408 % from the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of Partisans in power whistle "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, several hundred partisans, standing in the Cuban power, whistled out the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of World Human Rights Day and also thwarted another rally, which temporarily arrested a dozen dissidents.
Around the forty "women in white", wives or close-up political prisoners, were whistled out by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were walking into the center of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "merciers!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "There live Fidel and Raul!" the authorized guerrillas chanted with their hands raised against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civil agents who had appeared to "guarantee their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "women in white" had taken place the evening before in Havana, where there were no casualties or arrests.
A reporter from the AFP confirmed that a dozen dissidents in the havann district of Vedado, who also took part in the demonstration held on Thursday in the face of the International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civilian police.
According to this journalist, the dissidents who were booed by the partisans of the government under violence forced them to enter civilian vehicles.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the Women in White organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of "the request for the release of all political prisoners" whose number is around 200 according to the dissident list," said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a prison sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda is a member of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, 53 of whom have been behind bars to date.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents of the regime to be "merciful" or "agents" in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "contra-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a united party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of defamation of rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Insanity kills eighty-year-olds with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A maniac armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old and injured five more people on Friday, late afternoon, at the main business hours in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine).
According to the first data of the interview, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old from a previously unexplained cause in or in front of a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police records, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to a person in charge of the police syndicate Alliance, died in the hospital of the consequences of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he took a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured in hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of being killed because, according to police sources, apparently vital organs were affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in a "shock state" according to a police source.
The armed man, who according to police reports seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, immediately escaped to the street, the same boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two more passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, with the latter heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher knives, which he had crossed behind his back, explained on site Arnaud Pressé, a responsible of the Syndicate Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passers-by, including youths, are reported to have tried to tame the madman according to the witness reports investigated by the AFP.
I saw a guy in the thirties with a green vest.
Three youths tried to intervene.
They couldn't make it because the guy was well built, said Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city police officer who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61, two city police officers, including their superiors, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with stabbing, according to police reports.
The event took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are a number of shops.
Passersby came to me to tell me there's an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put her in first aid position and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach area, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person came in injured by cuts.
Police forces finally arrested the man who was not carrying identification papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor’s Office has commissioned the Hauts-de Seine Criminal Police Department (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The lunatic was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source doesn't rule out him being sent to a mental institution.
According to another police source, six police officers called to restrain him at the police station in Clichy, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" such as "all mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces release themselves during the course of the act".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for an end to prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to drop prosecution against his client, who is currently in trial at his home in Switzerland due to a moral violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", denounced gross procedural errors before three judges of the Court of Appeal in the second district of California at the time of the trial in 1977.
On the spot, I demand remission, M. Hummel explained before adding that the behaviour of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was charged with the case at the time of the trial, "run one's back cold."
According to him, the judge Rittenband, who had died in the meantime, had discussed with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which was a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), especially by the prosecutor in question David Wells.
At the end of September, M. Wells had finally declared that the authors of the documentary " lied".
If the Court refuses to close the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel asks for a trial to be conducted which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, has repeated the evidence already expounded in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the lifting of the facts charged to the defendant cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the USA in 1978, even before the sentence was issued for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
Since then, he has not travelled to the USA.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had declared that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants who are fleeing?, asks Mrs. Asayma.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the court for a favor and thus despises his authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even pointed out that "there are other alternatives to escape".
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the cessation of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, once again demanded that the criminal proceedings be lifted.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate being harassed by every resurgence of the Affaire Polanski and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Thirty-two years is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September at the request of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of eventual extradition.
Wall Street is slowed down by the rise of the dollar and closes without price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed without price on Friday in a market torn between better indicators than the US and an increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, while Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures available at closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has given 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"To be honest, the market is quite quiet," Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management noted.
"It remains strictly limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than intended, which "have contributed to improving the market outlook to the solidity of the recovery of the economy", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the US retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and much more than planned.
Furthermore, American consumer confidence has improved significantly in December, to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes have been slowed down by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has been at the highest level against the euro for two months, pushing ''the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation down'," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost some ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury bond yield increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening, compared with 3.482%, and that of the 30-year bond rose to 4.497%, compared with 4.492% of the previous day.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of round trip through South Africa, the 112 candidates to the title of Miss World will cross the last hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch a billion TV viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which is held for the second time in a row in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were selected Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true vortex of amusement.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, were simply exceptional.
I have seen many things and have had a lot of experience!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, from 5 p.m. (15 p.m. Central European time).
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova underscored in the heat of South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, encounters with the press and safari, the Miss now focus on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
It is, of course, the dream of every woman to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, throws Miss India in with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defil in traditional costumes and not to forget in swimsuit.
The performance is presented by a television presenter, the Chinese woman Angela Chow, by the ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and by a representative of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is able to receive the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to beat, assures Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visited the famous township in Soweto, but this time they tasted it by bike and local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not usual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, is undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise for this event a little more.
I'm wrong with people I could probably never approach.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Cup, promised enthusiastically Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
According to his son David, Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital there for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he got off the plane, in which he arrived from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 a.m. CET).
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured him that he would go "fastest" to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after surgery on a herniated disc on November 26th.
The singer "was put into an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles to alleviate his severe pain and to be able to perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma by the doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after a herniated disc surgery on November 26th.
The singer had to undergo surgery again in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes caused by the last operation.
His wife Laeticia took part in a school event at the French High School in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer from the AFP noted.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has severely burdened neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer on 26 November at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had committed the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were indignant, said Mr. Camus.
I've heard of the possibility of a trial being initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "traveled far too fast and this with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles."
I phoned this doctor personally, who assured me that he saw this trip as completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I already had two intervertebral disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after surgery "without drainage, without everything".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic milieu.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant , a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a haematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times due to failed operations and not forgetting about tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Association, has described him as "a man without scruples", who is "regularly" accountable to the Board of Appeal and is "anything but recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention had been "perfect" and that post-operative examinations had been "normal".
Operation "does not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been running since the last summer, seems to be in question.
It is clear that it is a bit too short for a continuation of the tour on January 8th (in Amiens), explained Mr Camus.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) is becoming energetic and calls on the party Nouveau Centre to stop using its seal
On Friday, the party alliance, which is supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem party, reacted strongly to an attempt to take over the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the part of the leader of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, and urged him to stop using this seal on any document under threat of legal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal because he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political heritage after he had given the left his hand.
The Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, also wanted to reaffirm this strategy before the National Council of the NC on Saturday.
In his efforts, he had received the support of MEP Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now NC), who claimed ownership of the UDF brand because he was the first to apply for this brand at the Institut national de la proprieté industrielle in 2004.
However, the office of the party alliance UDF, supervised by François Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they could not be expropriated and, under threat of judicial prosecution, set a deadline for the Minister and the MP to stop using this seal and transfer the trademark's property rights to it.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would suggest to your political movement to take over the UDF seal ++, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party, and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + today's UDF +, printed on your political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, explained the UDF office and called on the NC party "to remove the mention of the name UDF from all material and from (their) website without delay".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the property rights of the trademark to its legal right holders".
If you refuse to do so, we will bring suit against you to ensure respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, warned the signatories.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978, recalling that Morin and his friends "have made the choice" to leave it in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to form the UMP party.
Therefore, according to the signatories, the Nouveau centre party has no right to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 passed the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues: "At the time when he applied for the trademark name, he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years, but of the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of deposit of the acronym UDF to perform this for himself.
Furthermore, you point out that this recklessness is in the best way to turn into a crime, and ironicize the NC's strategy: "It seems to us in politics as well as in life more dignified to make a name for oneself, rather than trying to get out of anonymity by fraudulently acquiring a name to which you have no legal claim".
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier convicted of exploitation of weakness
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to steal part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photos, will have to answer for exploitation of weakness in court on 15 and 16 April 2010, a crime punishable by a maximum prison sentence of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair that is worthy of the Saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are sweeping each other and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal in their hands.
However, the 15th Trial Chamber also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is conducted jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to submit to such an investigation, especially under the conditions laid down during the investigation by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office.
The doctors appointed on Friday are expected to present a report before 10 March 2010, in which you clearly state whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undergo these tests.
I will speak with her, explained the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the Court of First Instance.
This is an excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, who must be protected, he affirmed.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has initiated a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of having exploited her mother's weakness for years to steal donations of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always refuted being manipulated by the photographer, whom she regards as a long-standing friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' plaidoyers on Friday led to a large family debacle.
Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer has thus relied on three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she distrusts the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please tell my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
I have never been able to speak to Françoise since her marriage".
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office once again considers that the applicant had no right to react in this way, especially because in recent days a guardian judge has refused her application to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place," confirmed Marie-Christine Daubigney, the prosecutor's representative.
The Court of First Instance has now decided to give a judgment following the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers.
Manager revolution or the end of strategic early education?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For more than a decade, the attitude of management of large companies in terms of its employees, said the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for staff to join "values" determines the best, as it used to be on consumer products designed by technicians in the factory to impose.
By placing the customer at the center of the business, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose customer preferences again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&D and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE ( Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) demands "a proactive approach and a forward-looking view from all parties involved; it demands from the employees a commitment that the instructions of authoritarian management completely contradict.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution that would consist in placing employees at the centre of the company's concerns on an equal footing with its customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire Orange submitted to its wage earners, stimulate this revolution in management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to see that, given a new situation, after many detours, the whole structure finally comes to do what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most executives have a much simplified idea of human behavior.
Her interpretation of psychology is mechanistic, originating from the major engineering schools.
Through intellectual comfort, they adopt the old Behaviorist theory, which was recently reactivated by the U.S. "neurosciences" and unknowingly widely disseminated by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "sic" to engage employees, a recent survey by Ipsos, published by Le Figaro.fr, strengthens managers in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identifying and measuring the mobilisation factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for wage earners, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of realizing part of their dreams, ambition and intentions.
At the moment only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their business on the basis of a given doxa that allows them to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the managers of companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their human resource management in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is favourable to the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo's speech: the "fair war" brings Obama praise from the right
On Friday, the American Right welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo the evening before, and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives, who had mocked the award to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the President's speech, following the example of the former Vice-President candidate in the 2008 elections, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, explained Palin, the face of the Republican Party's right wing in the U.S. Today newspaper, and added that she herself raised the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs published as well.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of violence; a way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, argued that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, ex-President of the House of Representatives, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, I felt that this speech was entirely historical, explained Ginrich, who was interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, considered by some as a possible candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they "were not free and could not hand over a prize for peace if the use of violence did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has given "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a "cosmopolitan," as "he always does," he "speaks like an American president," when he pointed out that Europeans "live like a security bubble they didn't create themselves and for their protection they don't do much," says Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a hawk of the Bush era, described the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "boring, lofty and inspiratory."
To the left of the president, democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the recourse to the armed forces.
If you pack up the war under the guise of justice, you can easily justify the massacre of the innocent, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, remains laudable alongside the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was prematurely awarded to Obama, called the speech "monumental work" even for a speaker like him who is known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "offers a timetable for managing international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California daily enthusiastically says.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time."
Long-distance drivers: Three marathons for an agreement to secure the supply for Christmas
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the unions of the street association and the TLF - the only employer organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening that put an end to the strike order and the impending severe supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State responsible for transport Dominique Bussereau "welcomed" the agreement, which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators split early Friday morning hoping to sign the agreement quickly in the late morning.
Even though the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting upset.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. to the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was not signed until 18:00 p.m.
The conflict "would have done the companies a lot of harm" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year", says Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not much, but we start small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now instructed not to block the supply centres anymore.
"However, there will probably always be some unruly people who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF Chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement."
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and for the maintenance of the total road transport budget in the first half of 2010, which will enable in particular to address the issue of 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the drop in employers' taxes amounting to EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the 2009 bill of adjusted finances, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government demands "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to first apply to the companies affiliated to the organisation and then, in the event of extension by the Minister of Labour, to the entire profession.
This will be the case "in no time", Bussereau assures.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the proceedings.
The association FNTR denounced a "fraudy trade" because the 100 million euros "were already promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but rather to avoid the goose-eaters getting upset on the approaching Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre association, the agreement threatens "to dig a big grave for the small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry over the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disturbing this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of RATP
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest express rail network in France for the Greater Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between the unions and the management of RATP (Independent Pariser Personentransportverwaltung) keeps strikers waiting with their demands for wage increases.
There were no trains on this important shopping weekend before Christmas between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one in two trains and outside the central line only one in four trains were operational.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced travellers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is trying to connect the big business in terms of traffic".
The line RER A runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The RATP section connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains operated scheduled to peak time, and almost none operated during low - traffic time.
As on Thursday, there was no human commotion on the platforms, as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, especially because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29) said that he would have got up "an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time."
The SNCF, which had planned to take care of passengers by staff and officers, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed via the Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the strikers' general meetings again took place, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the leaders on Friday afternoon.
The RER managing director proposed the specific drafting of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career paths, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-term wage supplement.
The CGT was outraged by the fact that RATP itself is placing its pay-as-you-go proposals in parentheses, stressing that the leader "is unable to solve a problem, whereas this was also possible for the long-distance drivers and SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting for the "comprehensive examination of working conditions" was scheduled for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company ignores "the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the branch of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership that refused any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line after an announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage supplement of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers travel daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have many years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a wage supplement of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the country's pro-Kurdish main party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government enormously difficult, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "site for activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", according to the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the resolution to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the dissolution. Moreover, he pointed out that 37 of the party’s leaders, including Chairman Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political activity for a period of five years.
In addition, the judge announced the waiver of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the Party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in parliament (of 550).
Before the verdict, the party leaders stated that parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than meet like non-partisan parliamentarians.
The decision was followed by a case initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "wisdoms" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is regarded by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court intertwines the government, which seeks to meet the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, in order to let the support of the PKK by the Kurds disappear and put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a resolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the prison conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan had led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP's premises in Diyarbakir, a city of millions in the southeast, which is populated mainly by Kurds.
The police used tear gas grenades and water cannons when the demonstrators started throwing Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court's decision "will deepen despair even further".
"Turkey cannot resolve this (Kurdish, editorial staff) question on the basis of a party's ban," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"In principle, we oppose the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedoing of democratic openness promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"One can obviously be prepared for a reaction by the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK committed itself to an attack in which seven soldiers were killed three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most brutal attacks of recent months.
Snowfall can come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the FES winter service manager.
But so that his employees can try out and master the entire vehicle technology.
At the weekend, meteorologists say it could be the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES will proceed according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows everywhere in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes are driven off with large-scale sprinklers, explains Brauburger.
These include main roads and thoroughfares such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire engines, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with gradients, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
If necessary, the approximately 1040 kilometres would have to be sprinkled in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "so that the routes are clear until the traffic starts."
It will be difficult if it does not snow until 7.30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is ready to make room for the stray vehicles".
Only after that, if it does not snow any further, will it be the turn of feeder and development roads, including the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints there, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES's footmen set off, hazard points and transitions are cleared out primarily.
The FES can usually not care about all bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which mainly keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
Since there is a quick smoothness on this, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the spreader is on its way.
If necessary, the police will also call him.
The cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa Hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-meter-long and 1.50-meter-large animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an oblong skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa hailae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body traits, reporting Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived some 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent of Pangaea at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationship, the propagation and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Triassic, team member Randall Irmis reports from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino's early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only single fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to the current doctrine, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these primal dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts discuss when the lizards split into their three most important developmental lines: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the velociraptor and the birds, the four-legged sauropods known as "long-necked" and their relatives, and the plants-eating ornithischia (bird pool saurians), which included the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus, for example.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hailae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hailae, for example, the researchers found clues to air bags, such as the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa hailae, the bones of the spine appear to have been partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive Theropode with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the giant sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight bones, probably the common ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three developmental lines separated early on and spread from South America across all parts of the world, which at that time still formed a single land mass as the supercontinent of Pangaea.
This is supported by the fact that the team together with Tawa Hallae found the remains of two other, not very closely related theropods.
The researchers argue that the three cannot come from a common immigrant ancestor.
We believe there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be distorted, because in South America many primitive Dino fossils have simply been preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile strain to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Earth's Middle Ages is still enigmatic.
During the Triassic period, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flight dinosaurs and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while the kinship at the border from the Triassic to the Jura died out.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction that happened to survive the dinosaurs, but not the other reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact caused a group of animals to bloom, which had also developed in the Triassic, and since then a shadow existence has lasted: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto stand on it, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are present, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police eviction of the occupied casino of Frankfurt Goethe University is making waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarising with the protesting students on Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" the police operation initiated by the Presidium.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike cleared last week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The damages, the signatories state, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police commando".
The eviction was an "inacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and distracts from the content.
The Presidium had withdrawn from the necessary discourse.
The lecturers demand the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage to property, it is said.
Protest Legitimized
The youth of the Verdi union and the German Trade Union Confederation are also solidarising with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi State Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen's science minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the president of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the President of the University.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbadener Landtag.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand vandalism, according to CDU member Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Left saw this differently.
The CDU uses painted walls as an excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they had been cleared.
The left has tabled a motion calling on the Interior Minister to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a strictly guarded location for secret arms research.
Today, the commune with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the center of Moscow, is known as the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have established contacts with the Frankfurt research location Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow vice-mayor Yuri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed planning director Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific research focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the large companies Sitronics and Rosssiyskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plan city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Green City") received its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgart brake block
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than lowering a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of Baden-Württemberg's capital for a decade into unhealing construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 originated from the spirit of the 1980s.
Head railway stations with tracks that end in the middle of the city were then regarded as 19th century traffic-technical fossils, which looked like brake blocks of a modern rail transport system, since it once took an enormous amount of time to move locomotives from rear to front.
Drive in, hold for a moment, keep driving - that's how it should go.
And that is why the head railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station located halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava on the trans-European rail-magistral - hence the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost priceless to implement the lowering in the Hessian and Bavarian cities.
Head railway stations, however, no longer have a problem with entry and exit since modern turn-over trains with railcars and steering cars have been installed at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 and the new ICE line to Ulm are now being tackled.
National and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway is involved, also because the risks of the largest single infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by taxpayers and not by the state group.
The project can still be reasonably justified in terms of urban planning.
New urban space is created, which - one believes the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the line are intended for passenger transport, to which - typically 80s - huge growth was attributed.
At that time, there was no competition from the low-cost aircraft.
However, modern transport policy must first be aimed at strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport.
However, the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy gradients.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros are to be buried in Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts believe ten to 15 billion are realistic.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks on the net.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the line has been built at slow motion speed.
Urgently, it would be necessary to press the tube properly here.
But S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rhine Valley route becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbadener Landtag whether it will go against the judgment of the Hessian administrative court (VGH) to the night flight ban in revision.
The CDU/FDP coalition asked experts to have the more than 400 pages of the VGH ruling examined in law, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
On this day, the VGH in Kassel had written reasons for the fact that, in the event of the construction of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport, the country had to redefine the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as provided by the state government, was incompatible with the legal protection of the population against nocturnal noise.
The coalition will have to decide by 4 January whether to review the verdict.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the representatives of the government to renounce a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promises of a night flight ban. Otherwise, this would be considered a "word break".
It's damn hard to keep your word, Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir said in reference to the FDP election slogan "We keep word".
Minister Posch dismissed Schäfer-Gümbel's accusation that the state government is trying to come to their night flights with "right-wing distortion and trickery".
An exact legal examination takes time.
The coalition did not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As it is the opposition, his group's statements on the night flight ban have never been.
US banks pay back aid
The crisis-ridden U.S. major banks are stripping off their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America repaid the aid from the bank rescue fund Tarp in the amount of a total of 45 billion dollars (a good 30 billion euros) in one stroke.
And the Citigroup also plans to repay state aid, according to a report from the US broadcaster CNBC.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that have been associated with the acceptance of the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had raised a good $19 billion of fresh money from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the sum from her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by branch sales.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The injection of money had helped over a very difficult time.
At the height of the financial crisis, the money house had moved away with the acquisition of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market to exempt itself from its liabilities to the State.
Already on Thursday, the US bank could announce a 20 billion dollar increase in its capital, reported CNBC, referring to circles.
A Citigroup spokesman didn't want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid.
Quick choice
Then everything went faster than I thought.
Hardly two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors pushed the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the panel wanted to vote on the personnel.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin, was the favourite.
However, there was no confirmation from the station - officially, in order not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role not to further damage the ZDF director Markus Schächter, should this proposal not be passed on to the Board of Directors either.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had failed on the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's election was a bitter defeat for Schachter, but an expected one.
The Union majority in the Board of Directors had already signalled weeks before the election that Brender would not want to be confirmed in office.
The opposition to the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had been organized.
With the argument that ZDF’s news broadcasts had lost ratings under Brender, he declined another term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on ZDF was scourged.
Most recently, even 35 state lawyers had interfered in the debate, which regarded Koch's actions as unconstitutional.
It didn't help anything.
Personal information
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance studies.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, initially to "today's journal".
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and presenter of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of the ZDF Foreign Policy; since then head of the ZDF Capital Studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after Brender's election, which was still voted journalist of the year by the industry magazine Medium Magazin on Wednesday.
Koch's opponent on the board of directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that employee proposals by the intendant cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck, however, also ruled out an excerpt of party politicians from ZDF's supervisory committees.
Brender's prospective successor, Peter Frey, had recommended a wise move to the Board of Directors by strongly criticising the Board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was nominated for the post of editor-in-chief without loss of face, as well as the board of directors, without being suspected of taking office as a party-goer.
In party arithmetic Frey is attributed to the left-liberal anyway.
Study Is Disrupted
Partial success for the students: After a year of the educational strike, the ministers of culture of the countries finally steered in on Thursday: At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and University Rectors Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor's and Master's.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the examination burden: In principle, each study module should only complete with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of students is to be checked and "a realistic and acceptable measure" is to be ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination achievements between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master courses more flexible.
In addition, there should be no derogations from the country rules.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have been carrying the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
Now, for the first time, it has been filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of examinations in some cases drastically: "Each module usually completes with only one examination", says a 30-page paper, which is intended to regulate the admission of study programmes in part.
The "significant reduction in the audit burden", said the Accreditation Council Chairman Reinhold Grimm, "should be halted by a lack of development that significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, the "studyability" is to be "the decisive criterion" in the design in the future.
Modules such as content are "strictly to check" whether "unnecessary limitations of students in the selection of
The Commission will continue to monitor the implementation of the programme in the Member States.
The students would have "a claim to have room for manoeuvre, to enable and promote their own initiative".
The rules should apply to the admission of new courses, but also to the review of existing ones.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – but this means that it takes until 2015 for all degree programmes to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this nationwide and are subject to the accreditation council set up by the Länder.
In October, the ministers of culture had called on the countries "with force" to influence the agencies in such a way that the material quantity is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rheinland-Pfalz pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, the universities are primarily to set up tutor programs and strengthen student advice as well as examination and foreign offices.
The country and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce an amendment to the Higher Education Act into the parliament.
According to this, only one examination is to be required for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to make the course design more flexible, to ensure recognition of qualifications at other universities and to facilitate access to the Master's degree.
By the end of next year, all courses of study in the country will be checked for their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had again argued about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Committee of the Juso-Hochschulgruppen demanded that the design of the education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
After the educational strikes at the latest, the students as affected should now also "speak a word".
The future academics received support from the President of the University Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experience," she said at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture on Thursday with which the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
All in all, the decisions of the Education and Science Union (GEW) did not go far enough: it demands a legal claim that allows each graduate with a bachelor's degree to access a further master's degree course.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that sufficient master's places with the best possible study conditions are available for today's generation of Bachelor students tomorrow, says GEW board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire significantly more lecturers.
However, the ministers of culture did not comment on a freer access to the master's degree.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and coming out is almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he addresses the arrival experience of a dissident who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic space in disturbing parts of the language.
Born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, Werner Söllner first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as an editor in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the director of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, he caused a considerable extra-literary sensation during a conference in Munich, which dealt with "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of its Securitate acts".
Söllner was visibly confused and embarrassed by an explanation in which he admitted his collaboration as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate to fellow Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present, Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun slowly, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "i.e. someone who has not fought enough against intimidation attempts by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize ceremony for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary examination of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is being shaken by a case that identifies the abysses and discord of a political system based on surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is not only a perpetrator, but also a victim, as far as one can say according to previous knowledge.
In his Securitate file IM Walter had played a role, said Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter.
He had "thrown it out" in all the points that were difficult for him at the time, according to Markel.
It was a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, but it is not entirely surprising that a former dissident and his collaboration with the Romanian secret service were committed.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
Those affected, one may assume, are speculated and in some cases probably also knew, which clear name hid behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and just also Walter.
Unlike in the case of the now very procedurally secure sighting of the Stasi files, the handling of the remains of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
Systematic education has been overshadowed and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the processing of the Securitate files (CNSAS) according to the Birthler authority was founded only in 1999, but the release of the files has been rather slow since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law regulating the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very great was confirmed by an interview after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar derogatoryly commented on the award winner.
She had a psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power here meant to be able to express itself quite blatantly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of Söllner, as is so often the case with hidden guilt, is linked to inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who was harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession makes us hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by a desire for knowledge rather than by blame and shame.
It is more than a footnote to the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday.
Saturation Supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there was just a neatly dressed field serviceman coming from a very nice Christmas party, where a sporting goods manufacturer Goodies had distributed, when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the outfitter, climbed into a summoned C-Class a quarter of an hour after midnight. ̈
The man with the striking baldness was chauffeured because of the city that was still unknown to him.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - alcohol was not in the game after all, and drunk with luck the 55-year-old was neither.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work continues.
Or get going first.
In the words of the Swiss only three days before: "We have achieved the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 victory against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is about to take place on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the king-class performance in everyday league life in Mainz.
And the weaknesses revealed again after the fast three gates by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th) to be removed.
Draw
The eighth round of the Champions League (returns 16/17 + 23/24 February/returns 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn on December 18th in Nyon.
The joy of the brilliant debut of the Babbel successor thus remained restrained.
Not only with the supposed healing charm, which in the short time had conveyed confidence, commitment and joy of playing to the insecure Stuttgart professionals.
I approached the players and told them to remember their strengths and encouraged them to be more courageous, soul shrink Gross explained the simple-sounding recipe for success, which had not had any effect under the therapist Babbel.
He has sparked a certain magic, admits Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, thanks to his dynamism, immediately became the best player on the pitch after weeks of injury, tried to describe the established "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working methods of the new superior: "He is a man who goes through and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel it had obviously been lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns sports board member Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all Constance.
Like Gross, players and managers were also careful not to overvalue the victory against a ersatzschwächte and completely overwhelmed defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at the 0:4 the bad awakening came, Khedira gave to consider.
And sports board member Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal was achieved, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
Heldt's 40th birthday, even after the first home win in three months, was not to celebrate, was due to the events of the weekend, which revived in the form of a TV interview broadcast by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had accused the board of leadership of weak leadership and had decided to change coaches at the pressure of pubescent fans.
Lehmann also considered that his day off had been cancelled after games as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and displeasure.
Lehmann's statements are "characterized by pure egoism," Heldt keilt back and announced consequences for the closing man.
I don't think they're gonna be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with everyone else that without the preparatory work by the replaced coach team, the playful and militantly strong performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a big part in the success", said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
WM-Fight in heavyweight
Hitziges Duel in Bern: Time and again challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitali Klitschko provoked with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title after version of the WBC.
The judge's verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains boxing world champion in heavyweight.
The 38-year-old champion after the WBC version defeated American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Before that, the Ukrainian was twice World Champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out with the knockout everyone was expecting.
Klitschko expanded his record to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he had to be beaten due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Berner Arena, the 2.02-meter-high Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight primarily with his left-hand leadership.
However, the eleven-centimeter smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly withdrew from the beatings of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights decisively to the finish.
All in all, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and just tried to make ends meet.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve laps.
The challenger had caused some fuss before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right".
When the champion was weighing, he was provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years of time off, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and got his WBC belt back, which he had previously had to leave without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the USA in September.
In this fight I only got one stroke and am very good in shape physically, Klitschko had founded a quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt of the WBA is worn by the Britishman David Haye, after he was able to dethron Nikolai Waluev, 2.13 metres tall, in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight planned for September against Vitali Klitschko in the summer.
It is said that his promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko in the London Wembley Stadium.
Case Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the air raid of Kunduz, the opposition submitted defense minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) to a deliberate deception.
The minister had said "knowingly the untruth" on the deadly bombing of two tanker trucks in September, said Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news programme "Tagesschau".
It's commonly called lying.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had, which Mr Guttenberg read, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about destroying the hijacked vices, but also about killing two Taliban leaders in a targeted manner.
According to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the US air attack requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
On Saturday, the Greens, the SPD and the Left called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Federal Government's Afghanistan policy - and whether Chancellor's Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery did not influence the actual deployments of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts about the Ministry's presentation of the background of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert had also been raised.
According to information provided by the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have correctly and completely informed about the background of the tank truck attack.
Officially, they said they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the Minister.
The two top officials, however, reported that they had even pointed out several reports to the Ministry of Defense, including a two-page document by commanding Colonel Klein and a fighter report.
Wichert is said to have asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He has not yet received an answer, it says.
The Ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the committee of inquiry of the Bundestag, which intends to constitute itself next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see pictures in a awake state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the mentally ill and in the drug rush the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything's fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we are allowed to surrender ourselves uninhibited to the wildest imaginations and imaginations.
However, those who experience dreamlike conditions in wax, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicted in the modern Western world, at least as a special thing.
But such images and voices do not only come about in the case of mental illness or intoxication.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, delusion and reality blur.
Dream-like altered waking states can occur in different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusion.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic rapture states, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal messenger substances of the brain - above all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, stated in 1861 that "a great similarity of delusion with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, delusions, illusions of such."
It's autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a cartoon character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky-colored.
Gravity has no power over him, it's floating on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil-figures with blood-red, distorted frays, squeaking teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, knots them into a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a speaker and lays the noose around his neck.
Jump.
The noose is loosening.
That's supposed to be a lesson to you, the voices scream in a drum-fur-shattering choir, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last one is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medications against depression, the mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness. He's been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The illusions are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, sufferers can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds; they get into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of size, relationship or persecution.
Voice listening is particularly common - voices that command, comment or dialog.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected person is no longer able to separate important things from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies that originate from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is in the center of the action, everything has a meaning directed at it.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he, like in a dream, is overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A comparison of reality is usually not possible for them, the illusions are cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, is basically preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are rooted in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles still puzzles researchers.
Excess states can cause any human being to lose the reference to reality for a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage in patients affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery, how the disorder of the neural system comes about, which at first does not manifest itself at all over many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brains are hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get some, says the Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether false images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a question of the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and delusions for ten years, and last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Irreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are one of the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease and brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
According to Kasten, hallucinations are composed of memory contents that are normally held back.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain is hot or when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can cause this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But it's also the withdrawal of stimuli, stress, heartache or other mental states of exception.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents said they had experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the Gymnasium there.
A normal girl, actually.
If it wasn't for the pictures and the voices.
In the break it may happen that a limp boy with long, dark hair speaks to it.
When it answers, the classmates look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this boy and the other illusions are not real and disappear again.
At night the apparitions are usually scary
Often the illusions are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher presents a new student in her eyes and ears, while he explains mathematical equations for everyone else, both audible and visible, on the board.
At night the apparitions are usually scary.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which comes far too rarely and far too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the faces or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes are created.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell her about it, they think they're crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed her Abitur last year and lives with her boyfriend.
The hallucinations stopped a year ago.
Ever since she made contact with the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Delusion is also a work of art out of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from irritation, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I guess the brain will be understaffed and will have its own conversation.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls Papa has not been her biological father ever since she could think.
Since the same areas of the brain are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected, such as Sarah K., to distinguish between illusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is taking place in the brain, the reality is reflected there.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, so they seem so real."
Even nightly dream images value box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenia, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their delusions as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Boundary state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too conscious world, imaginary experiences are mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief Physician of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful illness, but it also contains positive, creative – delusion is also a work of art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of dream-like changed waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that the experiencer considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state afterwards.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with self- and world loss, for example, by persistent, total incapacity to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to cope with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is reflected in the imagination.
An intensive form of sense and meaning in an intrinsically unbearable situation, which enables us humans to not perish in a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, while his body in the intensive care unit is doomed to motionlessness.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who make drugs from blood.
When taken by a Greek on a motorcycle to his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean Mafioso.
He goes up completely in the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental journeys are still overly obvious to me after years and in minor details.
More clearly and more intensely than what was actually experienced.
The intensity of this experience is beyond the horizon of our other life-worldly experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug intoxication show how fragile our inner images of external reality are in the wake.
Every change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist Kasten sums up, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
Snowfall can come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publishing director Kallen is an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children in the long term, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding company will continue to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to join the company, said the 69-year-old to the SPIEGEL.
We have provided for the details of this.
The question of whether they are also active in the company only arises after that.
Also the question of whether they are able to do so.
You can't put 7500 employees in front of your children if they're not qualified enough.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would withdraw from the chairmanship of the board from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, responsibility for the company's assets was added to the treasury and, after Jürgen Todenhöfer left, to direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding company should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family, Burda said.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe from the downfall: "This always concerned families who were infected by a greed for capital, who have completely speculated and thought that they could rise to become a very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had "never had world dreams," Burda said.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play in the World League with 'Time', these stores have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least this is what El Corte Inglés has set up, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping centre in Callao, Madrid, which is all about personal care.
In the wellness area, located on the eighth floor, you will find among other prestigious companies, such as Hedonai, which provide dehairing with lasers; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to set up your own beauty party with eight friends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just a few of the many options Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2 divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this kind of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session with the input of a personal password on a touchscreen, which is opposite the devices.
Afterwards, various videos will show you how to perform your workouts correctly.
The manager of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching exercises) are sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if you want to stop by the hair salon after you have trained your body, the Luis & Tachi company has a room where treatments to regain the hair's splendor, shine and health are offered for your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and so it is again a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their party dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that has to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated cleavage. You can only advise against that.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa together with the city of Barcelona created the "LIVE office".
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarize the opinions and measures of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The aim of this framework agreement is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, those related to energy and, in particular, its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in promoting the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, predicts the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of calm".
At the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the government president, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the government to support the automotive sector in the course of the government year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, today we would have a panorama of the neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," said the president of the government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided EUR 800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided for investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The head of government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's efforts to boost demand, in line with Plan 2000E, which is being applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows for an average of 6% reduction in exhaust emissions from new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which rose "by 40 percent" in November.
On 20,000 quadrametres of classic vehicles
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Classic Motor Show, an exhibition for experts and lovers of the world of engines.

Skill tests are also carried out with classic cars and motorcycles on a specially equipped race track in the outdoor area of the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmental Sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sport is perfectly compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the engine's automatic stop and start-up system, christened i-Stop, in the Mazda3 model, a device that is only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp at the moment.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 stands out with its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
Furthermore, the wheel's game is excellent.
When looking further at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, one can see that Mazda is on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the striking colors red and blue.
This style partly reminds us of the style of the Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can easily be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German automobiles, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort, so that four adults can comfortably drive by car.
To all this comes a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start-up system is currently only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed transmission.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out through its fineness, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who don't drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with gasoline engine because of its great comfort in gear shifting and its low consumption, even though Mazda's diesel models are the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
From the serial equipment stands out above all the assistant for the lane change (RVM), which removes the blind angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive inner mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth as well as the chrome-plated 17-inch rims.
In addition, this version also includes, as if it were not yet enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learnable Bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is its slightly high price, which is between 21.770 Euro for the model Luxury and 23,270 Euro for the tested model Sportive.
In return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day the highest driving pleasure.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red teppich of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look just as elegant as sexy, radiated more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your e-mails without a possibility to see certain attachments or to surf through the Internet.
It has enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the road is unlikely, but the idea itself is of interest to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example only half of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing its success, the company has launched two new devices: one intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free data service, in contrast to the Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but has a surprise at hand.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world on a smartphone already know what it means to do without all the data in order to be able to read their emails, once you have crossed the country border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience, you need a PhD in physics and a good pair of glasses to read all the fine print.
The European Commission’s repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs across Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails, and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have a wifi) can offer these types of tariffs means that telephone providers have to think slowly, but safely, and start considering different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, and its prices include downloading books and further inquiries on the Internet.
Without tarragon and without hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you pay for it only once, i.e. when you buy it, and not month after month.
And that's exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a shopping opportunity with lifelong internet access as Peek already offers in the USA.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I believe it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is without a doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
When Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and again chose the same colour to accompany him in his, no doubt, second most important moment in his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and to that she wore something large embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at the first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress at more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric they are made of.
At the inauguration she wore a dress of lace and a patterned velvet in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-high heels and the second time a changeable model, but gold-coloured.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was plugged up as a hair wreath on this occasion, and the previous one wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the conclusion of the study "Fruchtbarkeit und Karriere der Frauen in Spanien" conducted by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities on the labour market limited by their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are large differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether women work or not, and if so, what kind of profession they do.
Those of them who do not do any other work outside the house, work only half-day or have no fixed employment contract are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a permanent job, especially in the public sector, delay the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"Women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with a permanent employment are not given their first child, on average, until 3.7 years after they move together, a figure which increases to 4.1 years for women with a permanent employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have only completed the first child much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a great influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar regarding the readiness to conceive," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference has also been observed in women of the same age.
For example, women in the 35-49 age group became mothers for the first time, on average, at 25,1 or 32,1 for the first time, depending on whether they only have secondary education or higher education.
There is also another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women with their first graduation degree are already getting married and having their first child before their first appointment, the women with a middle or high school degree are doing it exactly the other way around and are first looking for a permanent position and getting married after it and then having their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is worth it too
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to his envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year on, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The leading actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will thus become another famous figurehead as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (colleague of Evangeline in "Lost").
The British Fashion Industry Award Ceremony
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
They all appeared on this occasion.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
In "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, pictures by Fernando Vicente), Manuel Vicent presents the three x-rays of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear-inducing genre (short biography, life and work), but rather seeks for an amenity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent does not save on terror or enlightenment.
In addition to the fact that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read over and over again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the unholy fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any god".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between fainting and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was fascinated by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted of coming to heaven on the detour of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 peaks in the world literature, you have to climb up the north wall, on the wall where the best climbers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny bitch.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a county landowner, and other times he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams bore witness to a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the mad cry, which was screamed out from a bridge by that personality from Munich, so that his echo echoed his literary way until deep into the night of the 20th century. He did this on a journey on which he fled from himself and pleaded for posterity with a speech full of violence before the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and begged: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I may at last stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are engraved these verses of Spencer: ' the sleep after the effort,/ after the storm of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after a full life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband accepted it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying on her between the azaleas or singing the birds in Greek.
Not a single case is known where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was much greater than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to instill Joyce in Baroja?
What, then, did Benet intend if he did not bring Baroja up to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except to destroy that man's fame so that he could put himself on this pedestal?"
Fig Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age were running next to her and our dog, our dog is a hybrid that we took from the shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue they gave him two kicks and hurt him severely.
Our indignation cannot be put into words, because it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun is supposed to be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was carried out on a leash.
Add to that the suffocation that a woman who went for a leisurely walk got when she tried to reprove these people due to the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he might also do the same with a woman, a child, an older gentleman or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o’clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog cried all day long.
Of course, we have filed a complaint at a nearby police station, but we have serious doubts as to whether this will do anything at all and in order to prevent possible prejudices from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation at what has happened has led us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must be done in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among the younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since this is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of her commitment to road safety, which "includes more than just designing and manufacturing products that are becoming safer and safer every day," and further confirmed that they also contribute to bringing this goal one step closer every day, with other actions of educational and informative character.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase, in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely for the reason that, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, they are always committed to one of their main objectives being the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks is increasing a bit again
After almost two years, the car market for vans finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in 2008 and, more importantly, they are the first ever increase after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Anfac manufacturer association and the Ganvam dealer association.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution, as the reference data used for comparison are November 2008, which was a particularly bad year of chewing, with a decrease of 60% in the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total registrations of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this figure includes all the vehicles that make up the small van market: passenger cars, pick-ups, small vans, small vans and lighter vans/cars.
Furthermore, the same storm clouds are still in the sky, which most affect demand, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, most of the sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100 % of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
Thus, to these restrictions, which are the result of the bank's turned-on money tap, there are other factors to be included, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In this panorama, and unlike passenger cars, financial support for the purchase of a 2000E car has not helped much.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, but also for self-employed and small businesses, if they want to buy a small van up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission that cannot exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had reminded us that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The association of car dealers predicts for 2010 a similar year as the one just passed, for which it expects a sales loss (for passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system at the time, and as is currently the case with the ESP stability control system, the emergency braking systems must become compulsory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans; for the remaining vehicles, a waiting period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many rear-end accidents due to their working methods.
The task of the emergency brake assist is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking manoeuvre, which the system detects on the brake pedal based on the braking strength executed by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to a study commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer able to step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system, thereby reducing the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents - it is expected that one in four accidents could be prevented by personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, the system will help him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is inevitable, the brake assist exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were already informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europa, wants the affected party to give its consent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, the final document, which will first be presented to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, may be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, which has backing from the Russian group Converg, is gaining ever more popularity.
In the absence of any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and really managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, with which he now weighs only 1,275 kilos.
In order to create such a thing, they first renounced the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent screen roof with manual drive, thus saving 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model like the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by removing the air conditioning again 13; moreover, the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 liters, thus saving another 7 kilos; by installing sporty Bacquet seats another 12 and with the light 19-inch rims again five saved.
Then one had also reached the missing kilo by the omission of the audio system CDR-30 again six kilos less and by the exchange of the door handles by handles made of fabric.
Although it is also available with the PDK double clutch transmission, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with 6-speed manual transmission, mainly on the smaller roads of California, on mountain routes that were really curvy.
In his driving behavior one can only give him the mark perfectly.
However, the reduction in his weight has not led to him being less confident on the road.
It's rather the opposite: for a long time we haven't tested such a small and light model, but at the same time it also gives you a feeling of great confidence in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low gear in the required time, until we give him the orders to race, slow down, recover and then take everything out of his engine again ...
The car does everything we tell him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and you can increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time at Panamera.
Acceleration is unimaginably brutal, whether from standing up or when accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the road, on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder, was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the potholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole track; and that, although we found ice at dawn and rollsplit in the morning on some of these curves.
In summary, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pleasure, as it is usually rare and there is much more to it than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will enter the market in February 2010 and cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bust friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same stubbornness as her bags of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
Despite the many out-of-the-art players in Dusko Ivanovic's team, the Caja Laboral celebrated an outstanding triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra, placing him first in his group after Mirza Teletovic's great appearance, who was the best of his team with eight triples (29 in the score).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the major failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mikov with a large amount of effort and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the Blue Reds, who from the beginning sat to the top on the scoreboard.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, one could already guess that they had come on the playing field with well warmed up wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the team from Álava opted for an internal game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was welcomed on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already started to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" ratings of Splitter already suggested that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage of the break, the game was not decided yet and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that not everyone wins on their playing field, and thanks to the constantly attacking "Hand of Elías" they came back to the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the "yellow" turning the rudder (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured, but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with a sense of accuracy in order to get some air back, and one of them suddenly came the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas made sure that the scoreboard showed a calming distance of (54-67) which the host could embellish with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
The Alavesen were just put in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had earned honestly in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team strength again by three points off the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and even though Splitter was put off due to fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, defended himself well and despite the Israelis catching up at the last minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injury prevented Unicaja from facing
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in Group B of the Euroliga to him, and that was marked in a game marked by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the indoor game, which made the victory easier for the Greeks.
The team from Malaga was not afraid of the mood in the Hall of Peace and Friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their performance in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja's appearance, even though the local team with an indoor match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show 22-20 in their favour in the 13th minute, the minute when, due to an action, there was almost a fight between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to warm up and its superiority on both sides of the game, while the departure of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-caused mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces in the Unicaja.
Among their players in the field and the Lithuanian foreman Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up was impossible
The third quarter of the game was marked by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which, despite its 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to compensate for the difference in the game played in Malaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn made the lead within the group waver.
Unicaja tried to get over the many failures and the departure of Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, some hope came back to 66-57 in the 31st minute thanks to the lead and triple of Cook and the use of Lewis.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, could not be braked.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to give himself up and had to give up the lead to Olympus.
How much should you earn due to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, learn their salary, which they should earn due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of the users on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users can enter a form on Facebook in which they can enter their profession, work experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found out that on average the Spanish employee feels "poorly paid", explains Albert Ribera, who is responsible for the product Trovit, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, as opposed to the 24,000 euros a Spaniard earns.
As a result, a truck driver has a net annual salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most wanted jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil Calls Zelaya a Date to Leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at her embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President removed from office must leave the diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010 at the latest, when his mandate officially expires
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that before that date he must have left the embassy where he had found asylum since September 21st.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27th as his mandate expires that day and he has to find a new place to stay."
The station also quoted the ex-president who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the scheduled date: "My point of view is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya explained on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was the winner), Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to obtain refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed due to Zelaya's refusal to recognise the status of asylum seeker politician, which the "de facto" government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the most tempting days since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment in which brokers make decisions about an inherently uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to allow the liquidity free hand at interest rates around zero, so that the banks buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost finished and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are beginning to spread some sand in gear, as the BCE was already presuming with its annual auction, which will take place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodoxes, and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are increasing again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to nationalize the private risks and sovereign debt is rising again.
The focus is now on quality again and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred haven for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the eurozone countries in terms of Germany.
Spain has hardly been affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision down regarding the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not hurt to silence the defenders of moral risk, who had once again tried to raise awareness among the leaders of world economic policy of what they had caused, as they had slowed down the devastating effects that the restriction of credit led to the loss of jobs when they had actually decided on a new day of thank-you.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece has already been foreseen earlier.
A government that hides public debt, elections, and a new government that pulls on the same lines.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from failing to fulfil its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a euro member country to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens with them in the need for exceptional measures to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some excesses on too high amounts, that would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
However, if European differences were to diminish and Spanish were to increase further, this would be a special Spanish risk.
This by Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local preferred indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and to correct their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long life, despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, even though at the moment there is a call for "careful driving".
Linked branches
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear before Parliament's subcommittee yesterday, where the Spanish energy strategy will be debated over the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion from that date to 2030, assuming that the current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not amount to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should no longer invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international networks.
From 2020, the question will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with carbon capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the condition of course by other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the proposal for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has called for, did not want to say anything against this law, such as to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, one clearly sets on this direction, despite some "individual" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, should already be taken, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, Swiss Port, is the preferred partner of the Irish Flugesellschaft Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, on which no figures have yet been disclosed, is scheduled for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to study energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for his first highway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first highway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its competitors.
A five-kilometer tunnel in Brisbane, Australia, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself as a construction company and highway operator in the country.
The city council wants the construction completed by the end of 2014.
After the administration opted for a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and toll administration.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly of European construction companies, competing with each other in the final phase.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second is based in Italy, one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
Acciona's team is contested by the Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure and the French Bouygues assembly.
The third and final consortium, which is in the short term, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction and privatisation, but it has a hurdle to overcome, as it is only through the purchase of a local construction company that you can gain access.
A strategy followed by the aforementioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be followed by the Spanish building giants.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona places great importance on this geographical area for the sector in which it is already well known for its activities as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate in these two areas and use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll road, which is promoted by the Authority of Infrastructure of the City of Brisbane and called Northern Link (northern feeder), has the purpose of connecting the western motorway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) over a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels. This is the largest measure of congestion reduction on Brisbane roads.
The timetable issued by the city administration foresees the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll road is to open up to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that the construction works will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex vent system.
The Queensland government is contributing 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to the financing.
For Hochtief, Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia is repeatedly awarding significant contracts to Hochtief, which signed a contract with the government yesterday, amounting to 154 million.
ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cables through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create fast internet access for 400,000 people and will keep the German company busy for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the 27-storey construction project of the King George Tower in Brisbane, Australia. Construction has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
Initial investments amount to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its subsidiary Alpine, FCC has secured the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia with a sum of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had been awarded the contract for the construction of the extension of the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria) over 130 million.
Alpine thus reinforces its experience in tunnelling.
The start of construction is planned for early 2010 and its implementation will take more than 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising budget from Renfe
Renfe has attributed advertising and marketing services to the agency Sra for the next two years. Rushmore reported about a sum of about three million euros annually.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that presented sch to this competition announced by Renfe, 4 of which entered the final round, among them TBWA, who was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalty of 63 million for France Télécom because of the competition's slowing down.
France Télécom has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for its anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition on fixed and mobile telephones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased, as the authority that monitors competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore relapsed.
Application trade
On the other hand, the French company’s subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application retail site on the Internet to increase revenues from non-telephone transactions.
In principle, this Orange application website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
It is necessary to wait until 2010 for this Siete to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The match in the Champions League has earned Madrid and Barça 476,4 million since the beginning.
The Champions League has become a source of income for football clubs since its establishment in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since then, which gives them the third and fifth place in the football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory with it. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5.362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish teams) that have participated in this event since it was founded in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is in third place in Europe, which has earned the most money through its participation and the only one who has won the trophy three times next to the AC Milan.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 took fifth place.
The list includes Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams who also earned the most money by participating in the past Champoins League.
And even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place among the countries that were able to match money through the Champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, as opposed to four bie Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure used by UEFA.
In this financial year, the organization, chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenues of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA earmarked 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualifying preliminary round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who won a participation received 3.8 million thanks to their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team). Clubs that have come to the eighth final each receive three million; the four that have come to the quarter finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million fixed income.
Barça, on the other hand, earned 2.5 million with his victory in the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are foreseen.
This money is allocated in proportion to the value of each television market.
The Spanish is among the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year's champion receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third placed and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part is distributed according to the number of games they play in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday leaked details of the purchase offer of shares with which it intends to acquire a cap of 25 to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers €1.5025 per share, which is paid out for ten years and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at EUR 1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18 % below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Group from Jeréz shall give the shareholders a period of 15 days to inform their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the Authority.
On completion, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
The Jesús and Jaime Salazar brothers announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit in an attempt to remain on the brink of possible offers of purchase and the judicial rifts of his ex-managers.
A decision by which she becomes the first woman to hold a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the chairmanship of the group.
This is anything but free of polemics because the company is involved in a court battle because of the suspicion of diversion of more than 230 million of Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will postpone further capital over the next few months.
With regard to Salazar's credit, the ex-advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their purpose.
CNMV approves the public exclusion notice submitted by investment company Mer by Paternina
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion notice submitted by investment company Mer for Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it authorised this invitation to tender after it had been shown that the conditions were in conformity with the law and that the content of the explanatory note presented could therefore be considered "sufficient" following the amendments made last 2 December.
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, which in turn represents 8.95 % of the share capital consisting of EUR 6,142,786 in shares admitted to the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
It was also announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the closing of the tender and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the law.
New programmes for the assessment of vehicles
In these days of storms and accidents not only the car workshops earn
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged to the workshops, where an expert must assess the damage and the cost of the repair.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer science tools, it is a matter of minutes
That's why almost 100% of the reviewers use this type of system.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from manufacturers in order to process them afterwards and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all expert opinions are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing with the tool market for review and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that manufacturers provide is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each providing the information in a different format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have come on the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes onto the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a laborious task, because every single one of the thousands of vehicle parts must be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphic image is created by each model, on which you can "click" on different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, work can be completed in a week if the process is proceeding quickly.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, 99.2% of cars sold in Spain have complete information about Audatex.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle park on the roads, it is over 99%.
For the purpose of documenting and producing databases, Audatex has eight centres worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive the updates every second day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or for the calculation of the value of a car.
The only company that informs about a guide who about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex offers this offer not in Spain, but in the United States.
When viewing the products that Audatex offers, it is easy to get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products AudaPlus, a standard solution for the assessment of accidents for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid for according to the purpose, i.e. for each expert report.
It will be most expensive for customers who use it rarely, a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5,75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that makes thousands of reports negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly line, using the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle panes, and AudaSubastas is an open service on the Internet for the specialist market, with which one can offer for vehicles that have been declared as total damage.
Your statistics service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or for obtaining information on the deviations by brand and model.
For example, it can be used to examine how many models of a particular brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a given period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes among others Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and supplies digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer in the same way.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT Expert Report Guide is a reference product on the market.
They work together with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 reviewers and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased to 20 % per year in the last three years and sales in 2008 amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they also began to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is done in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, including 3,000 in Spain.
Total sales in the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) total 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2 % more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock market and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Auctioning of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a flatfom on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant paying EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value added, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is exclusively aimed at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, reviewers, car rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and car dealers, who have to register before their activities.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website now has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been deregistered may no longer drive on the roads, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars of historical value may be re-registered even if they have been unregistered after difficult administrative procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The ease of use of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince the older professionals, who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the working hours, surcharges or discounts, and after that he can print the estimate and pass it on to his customer.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for peer review like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
Currently, the company Audatex is working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that automechanics have been waiting for for a long time since, for example, they can be used to select a door and then turn the picture completely around to look at the inside.
