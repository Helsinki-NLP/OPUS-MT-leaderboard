"As a state according to the "Winner takes all" principle, Florida gave all fifty electoral votes to Romney. Thus, it promoted him to the top for the Republican Party nomination race."
Organizers of the protest said that around 100,000 people took part in German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
In Berlin, the police estimated the number of demonstrators to be 6,500.
There were also protests in Paris, Sofia in Bulgaria, Vilnius in Lithuania, Valletta in Malta, Tallinn in Estonia and Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.
About 200 people protested in London in front of the offices of several large copyright holders.
Last month there were major protests in Poland when the country signed ACTA, which led the Polish government to decide not to ratify the agreement for the time being.
Both Latvia and Slovakia have postponed the ACTA accession process.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) once again demand the installation of surveillance cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses.
Chief Inspector of RSPCA New South Wales, David O'Shannessy, told ABC that monitoring and inspection of slaughterhouses in Australia should be on the agenda.
"""The video surveillance would certainly send a clear message to the people who work with animals that their well-being is most important."""
The US Geological Survey's international earthquake map showed no earthquakes in Iceland the week before.
The Icelandic Weather Service has also not detected earthquake activity in the Hekla area in the last 48 hours.
The significant earthquake activity that led to the phase transition had taken place on March 10 on the northeast side of the summit crater of the volcano.
Dark clouds without association with any volcanic activity were reported at the foot of the mountain.
The clouds made it unclear whether there had been an outbreak.
"The "Luno" had 120-160 cubic meters of fuel on board when it got into distress and the strong winds and waves pressed it against the breakwaters."
The twelve crew members were rescued by helicopters and the only injury was a broken nose.
The 100-meter-long ship was on its way to pick up its usual cargo of fertilizers, and the authorities had originally feared that a cargo could run out.
The proposed addition was already approved by both chambers in 2011.
There was a change in this legislature when the second sentence was first removed from the House of Representatives and then passed by the Senate in a similar form on Monday.
The failure of the second sentence, which proposes to ban same-sex registered partnerships, could potentially open the door to registered partnerships in the future.
Following the process, HJR-3 will be re-examined by the next elected legislator either in 2015 or 2016 in order to stay in the process.
Vautier's achievements away from filmmaking include a 1973 hunger strike against events that he regarded as political censorship.
French law was changed, and his activism began in World War II when he was 15 years old and joined the French resistance.
He documented himself in a 1998 book.
In the 1960s, he returned to Algeria, which had just become independent, to teach directing.
The Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, two-time Olympic gold medalist, died at the age of 54.
The cause of death was reported to be intrahepatic bile duct cancer.
He died on Tuesday in Osaka.
Saito was not only the former Olympic champion and world champion, but until his death he was also the chairman of the training commission of the All Japan Judo Federation.
At least 100 people had taken part in the celebration to celebrate the first wedding day of a couple whose wedding took place last year.
A formal anniversary event is planned for a later date, said officials.
The couple had married a year ago in Texas and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives.
The 30-year-old husband who was born in Buffalo was one of four killed in the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher who taught Modern Education and King's Glory and is said to have had 9000 students at the height of his career.
In his notes, he used words that some parents considered to be a thief, and in class he allegedly used abusive words.
Modern education accused him of having large advertising put on buses without permission and lying when he said he was the presiding English tutor.
He had already been accused of a copyright infringement but had not been sued.
A former student said that he "used colloquial language in class, taught flirting techniques in commentaries, and was simply a buddy of the students."
Over the past three decades, China has developed a market economy, although it has officially remained a communist state.
First economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China’s economic power has increased by ninety times.
China exported more cars than Germany for the first time last year and replaced the United States as the largest market for this industry.
China’s gross domestic product could surpass that of the United States within two decades.
The tropical storm Danielle, the fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the eastern Atlantic.
During the storm, about 3000 miles from Miami, Florida, maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (64 km/h) are measured.
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will increase to a hurricane by Wednesday.
As the storm is still far from entering the country, it is still difficult to estimate the possible impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Bobek, born in the Croatian capital Zagreb, quickly became known while playing for Partizan Belgrade.
He joined them in 1945 and remained there until 1958.
During his time in the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 appearances.
Nobody else has ever made more bets or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
He was elected the best player in the history of Partizan in 1995.
The celebrations began with a special show by the world-renowned Cirque du Soleil group.
It was followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a Janitscharenkapelle and the singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
Then there were rotating dervishes.
The Turkish Diva Sezen Aksu performed with the Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and the Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
"Finally, the Turkish dance ensemble Feuer von Anatolien presented the performance ""Troja"".
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle racer, died after being involved in an accident at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
During his warm-up lap, Lenz fell off his motorcycle and was then run over by his racing colleague Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately taken care of by the medical staff at the race track and sent to a local hospital where he later died.
Zayat was not injured in the accident.
Concerning the global financial situation, Zapatero added that “the financial system is a part of the economy, a vital part of survival.
"""We have a one-year financial crisis that has had its most intense timing in the past two months and I think now the financial markets are starting to recover."""
Naked News announced last week that it has significantly expanded its international mandate for reporting in foreign languages with three new programmes.
The global organization, which already reports in English and Japanese, starts broadcasting programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for television, Internet and mobile devices.
“Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I saw horrible scenes when people tried to smash windows to get out.
People beat the glass panes with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
One of the windows finally broke and then they started to climb through the window," said the survivor Franciszek Kowal.
Through the energy produced when hydrogen atoms are merged (or merged) to form heavier elements, stars emit light and heat.
Scientists are working on developing a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
However, this is a very difficult task, so it will take many years before actually usable fusion reactors are built.
Because of the surface tension, the steel needle floats on the water.
Surface tension arises because the water molecules at the water surface attract each other more strongly than they are attracted by the air molecules above.
The water molecules form an invisible layer on the surface of the water that allows objects like the needle to float on the water.
The skid on a modern ice skate has a double edge with a concave indentation in between. The two edges allow a better hold on the ice, even if they are tilted.
Because the lower part of the blade is slightly curved, the edge that is in contact with the ice also bends when the blade tilts from one side to the other.
This turns the skater. When the skaters tilt to the right, the skater turns to the right, when the skaters tilt to the left, the skater turns to the left.
To return to their previous level of energy, they need to get rid of the extra energy they have received from the light.
They do so by emitting a tiny particle of light called 'photon'.
"Scientists call this process "stimulated emission of radiation" because the atoms are stimulated by bright light and thus a light photon emerges, and light is a kind of radiation."
The next picture shows how the atoms emit photons. Of course, the photons are actually much smaller than on the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the stuff that atoms are made of!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament in the light bulb eventually burns out and the light bulb no longer works.
The bulb must then be replaced. It is necessary to be careful when changing the bulb.
First, the switch of the lamp must be switched off or the cable connection must be interrupted.
The reason for this is that the current that flows into the metal part of the light bulb can give you a strong electric shock if you touch the inside of the holder or the metal base of the light bulb while it is still partially in the holder.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart pumping the blood.
Blood flows away from the heart in vessels called arteries and returns to the heart in vessels called veins. The smallest vessels are called capillaries.
The teeth of a triceratops were able to crush not only leaves, but even very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists think that Triceratops ate palm fern, a plant species that was common in the Cretaceous period.
These plants look like small palms with a crown of pointed, sharp leaves.
A triceratops may have used its strong beak to remove the leaves before eating the stem.
Other scientists argue that these plants were very toxic and therefore probably no dinosaur would have eaten them, although today the sloth and other animals, e.g. parrots (derived from the dinosaurs), can eat quite poisonous leaves and fruits.
How would the gravity of Io affect me? If you were on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. So gravity naturally pulls less on one.
Unlike Earth, the sun does not have a crust on which you can stand. The entire sun consists of gases, fire and plasma.
The gas gets thinner, the further away from the center of the sun.
"The outer area we see when we look into the sun is called the photosphere, which means "Ball of Light."
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope and observed that Venus, just like the moon, has phases.
Phases occur because only the side of Venus (or the moon) facing the Sun is illuminated. The phases of Venus support the theory of Copernicus that the planets orbit the Sun.
A few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a Venus transit.
England had experienced a long time of peace after the conquest of the Danelag.
In 991, however, Ethelred faced a Viking fleet larger than anyone else since Guthrum's a century earlier.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with the ambition to regain his country from Danish rule.
After initial military setbacks, Æthelred was able to agree with Olaf on conditions. The latter returned to Norway to try to gain his kingdom with changeable success.
Hangeul is the only deliberately invented alphabet that is used daily by many people today. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth King of the Joseon Dynasty and is one of the most revered.
Originally he called the Hangeul-alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "the right sound for teaching people".
There are many theories about the origins of Sanskrit. One of them is about the immigration of Aryans from the West to India, who brought their language.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to Latin spoken in Europe.
The oldest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the collection of the Upanishads, the Sanskrit withdrew for hierarchical reasons.
Sanskrit is a very multi-layered and rich language that served as a source for many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the origin of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the battle for France ended, Germany prepared for the invasion of the British island.
Germany gave the attack the alias "Company Seelöwe". The bulk of the heavy weapons and supplies of the British army had been lost during the evacuation from Dunkirk, so the army was weakened.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy ("War Navy") and could have destroyed any invasion fleet that would have been sent over the English Channel.
However, very few ships of the Royal Navy were stationed near the probable invasion routes, as the Admirals feared that they could be sunk in a German air raid.
Let us begin with an explanation of the Italian plans. Italy was primarily the 'little brother' of Germany and Japan.
It had a weaker army and a weaker navy, although four new ships had been built just before the beginning of the war.
The main objectives of Italy were African countries. In order to conquer these countries, they needed a starting point for the troops to sail across the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
To do so, they had to eliminate British bases and ships in Egypt. Apart from that, Italy’s battleships should have no role to play.
Now to Japan. Japan was an island state, just like Great Britain.
Submarines are ships intended to go underwater and stay there for a longer period of time.
Submarines were used during World War I and World War II. At that time they were very slow and had a very limited shooting range.
At the beginning of the war they mostly moved on the surface of the sea, but as the radar developed and became more and more accurate, the submarines were forced to dive in order not to be seen.
The word submarine was also used in English in the "U-Boat" version, meaning German submarines in particular. Germans were very good at navigating and controlling their submarines.
Because of their success with submarines, they did not trust the Germans after the war to own many of them.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as "King Tut" or "The Boy King", is today one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings.
Interestingly, it was not considered very important in ancient times and was not listed on the oldest royal lists.
However, the discovery of his burial chamber in 1922 made him a celebrity. While many graves of ancient times were robbed, his grave remained almost untouched.
Most of the objects with which Tutankhamun was buried are well preserved, as are thousands of artifacts made from precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of the spoke wheel made the Assyrian chariots lighter, faster and better able to overtake soldiers and other chariots.
Arrows from their deadly crossbows could pierce the armor of enemy soldiers. About 1000 B.C. the Assyrians introduced the cavalry.
A cavalry is a troop fighting for horses. Since the saddle was not yet invented, the Assyrian cavalry fought from the bare back of their horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Perhaps the most famous person of this cultural circle is the legendary blind poet Homer, who sealed two masterpieces of Greek literature: the "Ilias" and the "Odyssee".
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights, and their pieces are among the greatest works of world literature.
Another well-known Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, who is mainly known for his famous thesis on the lateral relations of right-angled triangles.
There are different estimates of how many people speak Hindi. It is estimated that Hindi is the second to fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether very closely related dialects are counted or not.
Estimates range from 340 to 500 million speakers. Up to 800 million people understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu have a similar vocabulary, but a different type of writing; in everyday conversation, speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century North Estonia was under great cultural influence from Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the native people and thus developed the Estonian written language.
It was based on the German alphabet and a letter, Õ/õ, was added.
In time, many words borrowed from the German people merged, which was the beginning of the Enlightenment.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne went directly to the military after the end of school.
Charles then studied anthropology and archaeology, later also history, at Trinity College in Cambridge and graduated with 2:2 (a degree without special distinction).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to be awarded a university degree.
The European part of Turkey (East Thrace or Rumelia on the Balkan Peninsula) comprises 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey with a length of more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) and a width of 800 kilometers (500 miles) resembles a rectangle in its form.
The territory of Turkey, including the lakes, covers 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometers (291,773 square miles) are located in South-West Asia and 23,764 square kilometers (9,174 square miles) in Europe.
The area of Turkey makes it the 37th largest country in the world and it is about as large as the European part of France and the United Kingdom together.
Turkey is surrounded by seas on three sides – the Aegean Sea in the west, the Black Sea in the north and the Mediterranean Sea in the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but has only been independent since 1839.
Today's parts of Belgium were in the past part of Luxembourg, but were after the Belgian Revolution in the 1830s part of Belgium.
Although Luxembourg had always tried to remain a neutral country, it was occupied by Germany during World War I and World War II.
Luxembourg became a founding member of the organisation, now known as the European Union, in 1957.
The Drukyel Dzong is a fortress ruin and a Buddhist monastery in the upper part of the Paro district (in the village of Phondey).
It is said that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress in 1649 to commemorate his victory against the Tibetan-Mongolian forces.
In 1951, a fire caused only some remnants of Drukyel-Dzong to survive, including the image of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected and remains one of Bhutan's most sensational attractions.
During the 18th century Cambodia was forced between two powerful neighbors – Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.
The Vietnamese have also invaded Cambodia in the last years of the 18th century.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed and most workers work in the shadow economy.
Two thirds of the working Venezuelans work in the service sector, almost a quarter in industry and one fifth in agriculture.
Oil is an important industry for Venezuelans. Although only one percent of the workforce is active in the oil industry, the country is a net exporter here.
Early in the nation's independence, Singapore's botanical garden's expertise helped transform the island into a tropical garden city.
Vanda Miss Joaquim, an orchid cross, was named the national flower of the country in 1981.
Every year around October, nearly 1.5 million herbivores move to the southern plains and cross the Mara River from the northern hills due to the rains.
And then back to the north through the west, with another crossing of the Mara River after the rains in April.
The Serengeti area includes the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Reserve and the Maswe Wild Park in Tanzania as well as the Maasai Mara National Park in Kenya.
In order to learn how to create interactive media, conventional and traditional skills as well as tools that are learned in interactive courses (storyboarding, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.) are required.
Interactive design requires you to question your assumptions about media production and learn to think in a non-linear way.
An interactive design requires that the components of a project connect with each other, but that they also make sense as independent units.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the focus and number of lens elements required for a focal length range are much larger than for fixed focal length lenses.
This problem is becoming increasingly insignificant as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production.
This enabled zoom lenses to produce images in a quality comparable to those of fixed focal length lenses.
Another disadvantage of telephoto lenses is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is usually lower.
That's why cheap zoom lenses are hard to use in situations with little light without lightning.
One of the most common problems with converting a movie to DVD format is overtasting.
Most televisions are produced in such a way that they are pleasing to the general public.
That's why everything you see on the TV is cut off from the top, bottom and sides of the edge.
This is to ensure that the image covers the entire screen, which is called an overscan.
Unfortunately, the edges are most likely also cut off when making a DVD, and if the subtitles are too close to the bottom of the video, they are not displayed completely.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination and conjures up images of tournaments, banquets and Arthur Knighthood.
Standing between thousand-year-old ruins, it is easy to imagine the sounds and smells of long-past battles, to hear almost the hoof trapping on the cobblestone and to smell the growing fear in the dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
As was typical of the time, Kirby Muxloe Castle is a fortified house rather than a real castle.
His large glazed windows and thin walls could not have resisted a targeted attack for long.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began to build it, the country was quite peaceful and defense was only necessary against small gangs of marauders.
The balance of power was a system in which the European nations sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states,
The concept was that all European nations had to try to prevent a nation from becoming powerful, so national governments changed their alliances to maintain balance.
The Spanish War of Succession is the first war whose main problem was the balance of power.
This marked an important change, since the European powers could no longer use the pretext to fight religious wars. Therefore, the Thirty Years' War was the last war to be labeled as religious war.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on 21 July 356 B.C. in an act of arson by Herostratus.
According to history, his motivation was in glory at all costs. The furious Ephesians declared that Herostratos' name would never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo later wrote the name, which is why we know him today. The temple was destroyed the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander asked as king to pay for a new building of the temple, but his offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander’s death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.
Make sure that your hand is as relaxed as possible and you can still hit all the tones correctly. Also try not to make unnecessary large movements with your fingers.
So get tired as little as possible. Remember that it is not necessary to hit the keys with much force to achieve additional volume, as is the case with the piano.
To increase the volume on the accordion, use the bellows with more pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the pursuit of communion, identity, or conscious mindfulness in relation to an ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
The believer strives for a direct experience, intuition or insight into the divine reality/deity or deities.
The followers follow certain ways of life or practices that are intended to promote such experiences.
Mysticism differs from other forms of religious faith and worship in that the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness is in the foreground. This applies especially to those forms with a peaceful, insightful, blissful or even ecstatic character.
Sikhism is a religion of the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the 15th century in Panjab from a split of Hinduism.
Sikhs regard their faith as a religion independent of Hinduism, although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Panjabi means "the way of the gurus." The guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it has taken on a meaning that is the core of Sikh belief.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539), followed by nine gurus.
In June 1956, however, Khrushchev's promises were put to the test when unrest in Poland, where workers protested against food shortages and wage cuts, developed into a general protest against communism.
Although Krushchev eventually sent tanks to restore order, he gave in to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new Prime Minister.
The Indus Valley civilization is a Bronze Age civilization in the northwestern Indian subcontinent, which comprised most of today's Pakistan and some regions in northwest India and northeastern Afghanistan.
This civilization flourished in the basin of the Indus, from which its name is derived.
Although some scholars believe that civilization should be referred to as Indus-Sarasvati civilization, as it also existed in the basins of the now dried-up Sarasvati river, while others call it Harappan civilization – after Harappa, the first of its sites to be excavated in the 1920s.
The military nature of the Roman Empire helped to develop medical advances.
Doctors were recruited by Emperor Augustus and even formed the first Roman medical force to be deployed after battles.
The Roman surgeons knew several sedatives, including morphine from poppy seeds and scopolamine from the seeds of nightshade plants.
They controlled amputations to save patients from wound burn, as well as pressure bandages and arterial clamps to control blood flow.
For several centuries, the Roman Empire made great advances in medicine and shaped much of our knowledge today.
Pureland Origami is origami with the restriction that can only be folded once. More complex folds like inverted folds are not allowed and all folds have simple positions.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help people who are inexperienced in folding or with limited motor skills.
Children develop a racial consciousness and stereotypes quite early, and these racial stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children who identify with an ethnic minority who are said to be not good at school tend to be bad at school as soon as they become aware of the stereotype associated with their ethnicity.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and currently includes 54 million profiles.
These websites have caused a lot of interest, especially in the education sector.
There are positive aspects of these websites, including the ability to easily set up a class page that can contain blogs, videos, photos and other features.
This page can be accessed easily by simply providing a web address. This makes it easy for students who may have problems using the keyboard or spelling, to remember it and type it in.
It can be adapted so that it is easily readable, and also with as much or as little color as desired.
Attention deficit syndrome "is a neurological syndrome whose classically descriptive symptom trio includes impulsiveness, deflection and hyperactivity or excess energy."
"It's not a learning disability, it's a learning disability; it's ""concerning 3 to 5 percent of all children, maybe a total of 2 million American children""."
Children with ADHD have difficulty focusing on things like schoolwork, but they can focus on things that they enjoy, such as playing games, watching their favorite cartoon series, or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children tend to get a lot of trouble because they show a "risky behavior, get into fights and challenge authority" to stimulate their brains, because their brains cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
ADHD interferes with relationships with peers because other children cannot understand why they behave in such a way, why they spell or why their degree of maturity is different.
As knowledge acquisition and learning skills changed as described above, the basic rate of knowledge acquisition also changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different. The pressure was no longer in individual memory. Rather, the ability to remember texts became more central.
In essence, the Renaissance caused a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominides no longer use their hands to move around to carry loads or to swing through trees.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzee are of similar size and length, which reflects the use of the hand for weight loading in the ankle duct.
In humans, the hand is shorter than the foot, with the Phalanges being more straight.
Petrified hand bones, two to three million years old, show this change in the specialization of the hand from a means of transport to a gripping tool.
Some people believe that the experience of many artificially created lucid dreams can often be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that the clear dreams lead to longer time intervals between the REM phases.
With less REM phases per night, the state in which you experience real sleep and your body recovers is so rare that it becomes a problem.
This is as exhausting as waking up and watching TV every twenty or thirty minutes.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to dream lucid per night.
It was almost from the beginning not going well for the Italians in North Africa. Within a week of Italy’s declaration of war on June 10, 1940, the 11th Hussar Regiment of the British took Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
During a raid in the east of Bardia, the British seized the chief engineer of the Italian Tenth Army, General Lastucci.
On 28 June, Marshall Italo Balbo, the governor general of Libya and alleged successor to Mussolini, was accidentally killed by firing his own troops while landing in Tobruk.
Modern fencing is practiced on many levels, from university students to professional and Olympic competitions.
The sport is carried out primarily as a duel by one fencer fighting with another.
Golf is a game where players use clubs to transport balls into holes.
During an ordinary round, eighteen holes are played, with players usually starting at the first hole of the course and stopping at the eighteenth.
The player who needs the least punches or turns with the racket to complete the course wins.
The game is played on a lawn. The grass around the hole is mowed shorter and called the green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is what most people associate with travel: recreation tourism.
This is the case when people go to a place for relaxation and pleasure that is very different from their normal everyday life.
Beaches, amusement parks and campsites are among the places most visited by leisure tourists.
If the goal of visiting a particular place is to experience its history and culture, this type of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different attractions in a country, or they can simply choose to focus on just one region.
The colonists had also called for reinforcement when they observed this activity.
Among the troops who strengthened the advanced defensive positions were the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments with 200 men under Colonel John Stark and James Reed (who later became both generals).
Strong men stood along the fence at the north end of the position of the colonists.
When the tide created a gap along the Mystic River in the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence in a northerly direction with a short stone wall that ended on a small beach on the edge of the water.
Gridley or Stark placed a stake about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one should fire before the regular soldiers had passed it.
The American plan focused on carrying out coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder carried out a diversion attack on the British garrison in Bordentown to block any further troops.
General James Ewing would lead 700 militias across the river at Trenton Ferry, take the bridge over Assunpink Creek, and prevent all enemy troops from fleeing.
The main assault force of 2,400 men was to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, to launch an attack before dawn.
By changing from a quarter-mile to a half-mile race, the pace is much less important and endurance is an absolute necessity.
Of course, a first-class 800m runner running under two minutes must be fast, but in any case endurance must be trained.
Some cross running in winter combined with a workout of the upper body in the sports hall is the best preparation for the running season.
Good nutrition alone does not guarantee top performance, but it significantly improves the overall well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy balance of energy, effective drinking habits and understanding the various aspects of taking supplements can help athletes improve their performance and enhance their enjoyment of sports.
Medium-distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport, but there are many misunderstandings about the few equipment you need.
The products can be purchased as needed, but most will have little or no real impact on performance.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product, even if it does not offer any real benefits.
The atom can be regarded as one of the fundamental building blocks of any matter.
It is a very complex unit that, according to a simplified drilling model, consists of a central core orbited by electrons, similar to the Sun from the planets – see Figure 1.1.
The atomic nucleus consists of two particles – neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge, while neutrons have no charge. The electrons have a negative electric charge.
To check the opera, you must first get an overview of the venue in order to guarantee your safety.
You must note the position of the victim when you approach it, as well as all automatic warning signs.
If you hurt yourself trying to help, you'll only make things worse.
The study found that depression, anxiety, and disaster thinking have an impact on the connection of pain and activity limitation in witch fire patients.
Only the effects of catastrophism, but not depression and anxiety were prerequisites for regular weekly structured sessions with physical activities.
Those who participated in regular activities needed more support in terms of negative pain perception when it came to distinguishing chronic pain and discomfort from normal physical exercise.
Vision, that is, the ability to see, depends on the sensory organs of the visual system or the eyes.
Eyes can be built in many ways, whose complexity differs from the requirements of the life form.
The different designs have different abilities, are susceptible to different wavelengths and have different visual acuity. In addition, they require different types of processing of the recorded to make a meaningful impression, and the number of eyes associated with the respective design type, which is necessary for optimal radioionation, is different.
A population is the collection of organisms of a particular species within a specific geographical area.
If all individuals of a population resemble each other in relation to a particular phenotypic characteristic, then they are called monomorphic.
If the individuals have different variations of a certain property, they are polymorphic.
Ants also march and nest in different phases.
In the nomadic phase, hiking ants march at night and rest during the day.
The colony begins a nomadic phase when the available food has declined. During this phase, the colony builds temporary nests that are changed daily.
Each of these nomadic parades or marches lasts about 17 days.
"What is a cell? The word cell originates from the Latin word "cella," which means "small space," and it was first coined by a microscopician who observed the structure of cork."
The cell is the basic unit of all living beings and all organisms consist of one or more cells.
Cells are considered to be so fundamental and crucial in the study of life that they are often referred to as building blocks of life.
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body to keep the blood flow unhindered in motion.
These nerve impulses can be sent very quickly through the entire body to protect it from a potential threat.
Tornadoes encounter a rather small area in comparison to other violent storms, but they can destroy anything that stands in their way.
Tornados uproot trees, rip boards of buildings, and hurl cars through the air. The strongest 2 percent of tornadoes last more than three hours.
These monster storms have winds reaching speeds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 MPH).
People have been producing and using magnifying lenses for thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were built in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear both closer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will always accompany us and it is in the nature of cooperation that there is more and more to gain with selfish behavior as long as the majority benefits.
It remains to be hoped that most people realize that their long-term best option is to work with others.
Many people dream of the day when people can travel to other stars and explore other worlds. Some people are concerned about what is out there. Some believe that aliens or other life forms could exist on other planets.
But if this ever happens, it will take a very long time to do so. The stars are so scattered that even between "neighbours" there are trillions of kilometers.
Perhaps one day your great-grandsons will be standing on the top of an alien world wondering who their ancestors were?
Animals consist of numerous cells. They eat things and digest them inside. Most animals can move.
Only the animals have a brain (even if not all the animals have one; jellyfish, for example, do not have one).
Animals can be found all over the world. They roam through the ground, swim in the oceans and fly in the air.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living organism.
Cell comes from the Latin word cella, which means small space.
If you look at living beings under a microscope, you will see that they consist of smaller squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, discovered small squares in the cork under the microscope.
They looked like rooms, he was the first person to watch dead cells.
Elements and connections can move from one state to another and cannot change.
Nitrogen as a gas still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser, but the molecules are the same.
Water is another example. The connection water consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure, whether it is gaseous, liquid or solid.
Although its aggregate state may change, the chemical state remains the same.
Time is something that surrounds us everywhere and affects everything we do, and yet is difficult to understand.
For thousands of years, time has been explored by religious, philosophical and scientific thinkers.
We experience time as a sequence of events that run from the future through the present to the past.
Time is also the way we compare the duration (length) of events.
One can mark the passing of time itself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens regularly again and again.
Computers are used nowadays to manipulate images and videos.
Demanding animations can be constructed on the computer and are increasingly used on television and in films.
Music is often recorded with the help of sophisticated computers to process and mix sounds.
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries long Zait was thought to be the first inhabitants of New Zealand to be the Maoris who hunted giant birds called Moa.
The theory then led to the idea that the Maoris of Polynesia migrated with a large fleet, New Zealand took away the Moriori and founded a society based on agriculture.
New evidence suggests, however, that the Moriori were a group of Maori from the mainland who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and developed their own peaceful culture there.
There was another tribe in the Chatham Islands, Maori, who migrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriori, there were some skirmishes and in the end the Moriori were destroyed.
Individuals who have been involved for several decades have helped us to appreciate our strengths and passions, while difficulties and even failures have been sincerely assessed.
By listening to individuals who have shared their personal, family and organizational stories, we have gained valuable insights into the past and into some personalities who have influenced the culture of the organization for good and for bad.
Understanding one's own history does not require an understanding of culture, but it at least helps people to get a sense of where they stand in the history of the organization.
As they evaluate the successes and notice the failures, individuals and all participants as a whole strengthen the values, the mission and the driving forces of the organization.
In this case, the memory of previous cases of entrepreneurial behaviour and the resulting successes helped people to be open to changes and a new orientation of the parish.
Success stories like these reduced the fear of change and at the same time created a positive attitude towards coming changes.
Converged thought patterns are methods of problem solving that bring together different ideas or areas to find a solution.
In this way of thinking, the focus is on speed, logic and accuracy, including the identification of facts, the re-application of existing techniques, the collection of information.
The most important factor in this attitude is this: there is only one correct answer. You think of only two possible answers, namely right or wrong.
This kind of thinking is associated with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this way of thinking think logically, can remember patterns, solve problems, and work on scientific tests.
People are by far the most gifted way of reading other people's thoughts.
This means that we are able to properly assess what other people perceive, do, think, know or want to do.
In addition to these abilities, it is crucial to understand the intentions of others. It allows us to eliminate possible ambiguities of physical actions.
For example, if you see someone smashing a car window, you'd probably think he's trying to steal a stranger's car.
He would have to be judged differently if he had lost his car keys and it would have been his own car he was trying to break into.
The MR is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (KMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (at Harvard University).
With this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves cause atoms to emit tiny radio signals.
In 1970, the physician and researcher Raymond Damadian discovered the basis for the use of magnetic resonance imaging as an aid for medical diagnosis.
Four years later, a patent was granted, which was the world's first patent in the field of MRI.
"In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first "full body" MRI scanner, which he called the "unobservable."
Asynchronous communication gives time for reflection and response to others.
It allows students to work at their own speed and to control the pace of learning.
There are also fewer time constraints and the possibility of working at flexible times. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web enables learners to have access to information at any time.
Students can also ask the lecturers questions at any time of the day and expect relatively quick answers instead of waiting for the next personal meeting.
The postmodern approach of learning offers the freedom of Absolute. There is not only a good way to learn.
In fact, there is not a good thing to learn. Learning takes place in the experience between the learner and the knowledge offered.
Our current experience with the many TV shows, which deal with do-it-yourself approaches, information sharing and learning, underlines this observation.
So many of us get caught watching a TV show that informs us about a process or experience, even though we will never participate in it or apply this knowledge.
We will never overtake a car, build a well in our backyard, travel to Peru to investigate ancient ruins, or remodel our neighbor's house.
Greenland is well connected thanks to underwater fibre optic connections to Europe and broadband satellites and 93% of the population has Internet access.
Your hotel or hosts (if you stay in an inn or a private apartment) are likely to have Wi-Fi or a PC connected to the Internet. In addition, all settlements have an Internet café or a place with publicly accessible Wi-Fi.
"As already mentioned, the word "Eskimo" is still acceptable in the United States, but is regarded as derogatory by many Arctic peoples outside the United States, especially in Canada."
You may hear this word from the natives of Greenland, but foreigners should avoid it.
The natives of Greenland call themselves in Canada Inuit and in Greenland Kalaalleq (multiple Kalaallit), i.e. Grönländer.
Crime and distaste for foreigners in general are practically unknown in Greenland, and even in cities there are no 'problem zones'.
Cold weather may be the only real danger the unprepared might encounter.
If you visit Greenland in a cold season (if you consider that the further north you travel, the colder it gets), it is essential to bring clothes that are warm enough.
The very long summer days can lead to inadequate sleep and associated health problems.
Pay attention to the Nordic mosquitoes during the summer. Even if they do not transmit diseases, they are very annoying.
Although San Francisco's economy is linked to the fact that the city is a world-class tourist attraction, it is nevertheless diversified.
The largest areas of employment are professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
Their frequent representation in music, films, literature and pop culture has helped to make the city and its landmarks known all over the world.
San Francisco has built up a comprehensive tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants and first-class congress facilities.
San Francisco is also one of the country's best places for other Asian cuisine: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
A trip to Walt Disney World is a great pilgrimage for many American families.
The "typical" visit includes the flight to Orlando International Airport, then the bus ride to a Disney hotel on the premises, then a week-long stay there without leaving the Disney area, and then the journey home.
"There are countless variations possible, but this is what most people think when they speak of a "journey to Disney World."
Many tickets sold online via auction websites such as eBay or Craigslist are already partially used multi-day Park Hopper tickets.
This is very often handled in this way, but is forbidden by Disney: The tickets are not transferable.
For camping below the edge of the Grand Canyon you need a permit for the hinterland.
Licenses are limited to protect the canyon and are available from the first of the month, four months before the start month.
As a result, on 1 January a permit for the hinterland is available for any starting date in May.
The place for the most popular areas, such as the Bright Angel Campground next to the Phantom Ranch, is usually filled by those requests received on the first day on which reservations are possible for them.
There are a limited number of permits reserved for occasional requests and are awarded according to the principle of 'who comes first, grinds first'.
Entering southern Africa by car is an amazing way to see all the beauty of the region and get to places off the beaten track.
This can be done with careful planning in a normal car. However, a four-wheel drive is strongly recommended, as many places can only be reached with four-wheel drive and high wheelbase.
When planning, remember that the south of Africa is stable, but not always the neighbouring countries.
Visa requirements and costs vary with each country and depend on the country from which you come.
Each country also has specific laws requiring which items must be in the car for emergencies.
Victoria Falls is a city in the western part of Zimbabwe, on the other side of the border of Livingstone, Zambia, and near Botswana.
The city is located right next to the waterfalls and they are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers both adventurers and tourists, numerous opportunities for a longer stay.
During the rainy season (November to March) the amount of water will be higher and the cases will be more dramatic.
You can assume that you will get wet when you cross the bridge or use the winding paths that lead along the waterfalls.
On the other hand, because of the high water volume, your view of the actual waterfall is hidden – through the whole water!
Tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 is probably the most famous tomb in the valley. The tomb of the young king was discovered in 1922 by Howard Carter in almost intact condition.
Compared to most other royal tombs, however, the tomb of Tutankhamun is hardly worth a visit, as it is much smaller and has few decorations.
Anyone interested in seeing evidence of the damage inflicted on the mummy during the removal attempts from the coffin will be disappointed, as only the head and shoulders are visible.
The fabulous riches of the tomb are no longer in it, but were brought to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors who have limited time should prefer to spend it elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This temple on a hill was built at the end of the 9th century during the reign of King Yasovarman.
The gloomy atmosphere of the temple and the view over Lake Tonle Sap are worth climbing the hill.
A visit to the sight can be easily connected with a boat trip on the lake.
The Angkor Pass is required to enter the temple. Therefore, do not forget to take your passport with you when you travel to Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is Israel’s capital and largest city, but most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize the city as Israel’s capital.
The ancient city on the hills of Judea has a fascinating history that spans thousands of years.
The city is considered sacred in the three monotheistic religions – Judaism, Christianity and Islam – and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural centre.
In view of the religious significance of the city and especially the many sights within the old city, Jerusalem is one of Israel's most important tourist destinations.
Jerusalem offers many historical, archaeological and cultural sites along with dynamic and lively shopping centers, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to receive an invitation letter before entering Ecuador via international airports or border crossing points.
This letter must be declared legal by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and must meet certain requirements.
These requirements are designed to ensure a regulated migration flow between the two countries.
Cuban citizens who are holders of a US Green Card should visit an Ecuadorian consulate to obtain exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the period of your trip. A return or further flight ticket is required to prove the length of your stay.
Tours are cheaper for larger groups. If you are travelling alone or just with a friend, then you should get together with others and try to start a group of four to six people in order to get a fare that is cheaper for the individual.
But you should not worry about this, because tourists are often grouped together so that the vehicles become full.
It's more of a trick to make people think they have to pay more.
High above the northern edge of Machu Picchu is this steep mountain, which often represents the backdrop of many photos of the ruins.
From below it looks a little daunting and it is a steep and difficult climb, but most of the reasonably fit people should be able to cope with it in about 45 minutes.
Most of the way is covered with stone steps, and in the steeper sections steel ropes form a supporting railing.
However, calculate to be out of breath and be careful in the steeper sections, especially when it is wet, as it can quickly become dangerous there.
Near the summit is a tiny cave that is quite low and very narrow.
The sights and wildlife of the Galapagos Islands can best be visited by boat, as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships travel in the waters around the Galapagos Islands – the size of which can range from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most people book their place long in advance (because the boats are usually full during the high season).
Make sure you book through an intermediary specialized in the Galapagos Islands who knows well about a wide range of ships.
This way you can make sure that the ship best suits your special wishes and/or limitations.
Before the Spaniards reached Chile in the 16th century, the north of the country was under the rule of the Inca, while the center and south of the country was inhabited by the native Araucans (Mapuche).
The Mapuche were also one of the last independent indigenous groups in America that were not completely absorbed into Spanish-speaking rule until after Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared its independence in 1810 (amidst the Napoleonic Wars, which for some years did not have a functioning central government), the final victory could not be won until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a country in the Caribbean that covers the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
In addition to white sandy beaches and mountain landscapes, the country is home to the oldest European city in America, now part of Santo Domingo.
The island was originally inhabited by the Taíno and Caribs. The Caribs spoke Arawak and arrived there about 10,000 years BC.
Within a few years of the arrival of the European explorers, the population of the Taino had experienced a significant decline by the Spanish conquistadors.
After Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), the Spanish conquerors killed around 100,000 Taínos between 1492 and 1498.
Jardín de la Unión. This complex was built as an atrium for a 17th century monastery from which the only building of the Templo de San Diego is preserved.
Now it serves as a central place where numerous events take place day and night.
There are numerous restaurants in the surroundings of the garden, where in the afternoon and evening often free concerts take place in the central pavilion.
Callejon del Beso (Kussgasse). Two balconies, which are only 69 cm away, are the place of an old love story.
For some change, a couple of kids tell you about the story.
Bowen Island is a popular day or weekend excursion with kayaking, hiking, shops, restaurants and much more.
This authentic community is located in Howe Sound near Vancouver and is easily reached by regular water taxis departing from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
For those who like to be active outdoors, a hike up to Sea-to-Sky-Corridor is essential.
Whistler (1.5 hours drive from Vancouver) is expensive, but very well known due to the 2010 Winter Olympics.
Enjoy the winter at some of North America's top ski resorts, and during the summer you should try real mountain biking.
Permits must be ordered in advance. You need a permit to stay in La Sirena.
Sirena is the only ranger station that offers tents, dormitory accommodation and hot meals. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos only offer self-catering camping.
It is possible to get a parking license directly at the ranger station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept credit cards
The park administration (MINAE) does not issue permits for the park earlier than a month before the planned arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a reservation service for a fee of 30 US-Dollars or 10 US-Dollars for daily tickets. Details can be found on their Corcovado-page.
The Cook Islands are an island state freely associated with New Zealand and lie in Polynesia in the middle of the South Pacific.
It is an archipelago of 15 islands that spread over 2.2 million square kilometers of ocean.
With the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes referred to as "Hawaii Down Under".
Although smaller, it reminds some older visitors of Hawaii before it became a state, without all the major tourist hotels and other development.
The Cook Islands do not have cities, but consist of 15 different islands. The most important ones are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
In developed countries, offering luxury guest houses has today been elevated to a kind of art form.
At the upper end of the scale, of course, the B&Bs compete mainly for two main points: beds and breakfast.
Therefore, the best of these accommodations can be found the most opulent bedding, possibly a hand-made blanket or an antique bed frame.
At breakfast there can be seasonal delicacies of the region or the special dish of the host.
The frame can be a historical old building with an ancient equipment, a beautifully prepared terrain and a swimming pool.
Getting into your own car and going on a long journey has an immanent appeal through its simplicity.
Unlike larger vehicles, you are probably already familiar with driving your car and know its limits.
Setting up a tent on a private property or in a city of any size can quickly lead to undesirable reactions.
In short, using your own car is a great option for a road trip, but rather not for camping.
Camping with a car is a possibility, provided you have a spacious minivan, SUV, limousine or combi car with folding seats.
The heritage of some hotels dates back to the golden age of steam railways and ocean liners, the period before the Second World War, the 19th or early 20th century.
In these hotels, the rich and famous used to spend the night and enjoy good food and nightlife.
The ancient facilities, the absence of modern conveniences and a certain elegant age are also their character.
Although they are usually privately owned, they sometimes house heads of state and other dignitaries who are visiting.
Very wealthy travelers could choose a flight around the world that alternates with visits to many of these hotels.
A so-called Hospitality Exchange Network is the organization that brings travelers in the cities they visit together with locals.
Joining such a network usually requires merely filling in an online form; although some networks offer or require additional verifications.
A list of available accommodations is now available either in print or online. It sometimes includes recommendations and reports from other travelers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 because the computer programmer Casey Fenton had found a cheap flight for a trip to Iceland, but no overnight accommodation.
He sent e-mails to local university students and received an overwhelming number of offers for free accommodation.
Hostels are primarily aimed at young people – a typical guest is in his twenties – but you can often find older travelers there.
Families with children are a rare sight, but some hostels allow them to stay in private rooms.
The city of Beijing in China will host the Olympic Winter Games in 2022, making it the first city to host both the summer and winter Olympics.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the indoor ice events.
Further ski events take place in the Taizicheng ski area in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most temples have an annual festival between the end of November and the middle of May, which varies according to the annual calendar of each temple.
Most temple festivals are celebrated in the context of the Temple Jubilee, the birthday of the supreme deity or other important events related to the temple.
The temple festivals in Kerala with regular parades of decorated elephants, temple orchestras and other festivities are very interesting to observe,
A world exhibition (often called World Expo or simply Expo) is a major international festival of arts and sciences.
Participating countries exhibit artistic and educational exhibits in national pavilions to present global concerns or the culture and history of each country.
International horticulture exhibitions are special events where flower shows, botanical gardens and everything else related to plants are presented.
Although theoretically they can take place annually (as long as they are in different countries), this is different in practice.
These events usually last for three to six months and are held in places covering at least 50 hectares.
Over the years, many different film formats have been used. The normal 35 mm film (negative with dimensions of 36 x 24 mm) is most common.
It can usually be easily replicated when you run out, and it has a resolution similar to that of current digital SLR cameras.
Some medium format film cameras use a format of 6 x 6 cm, more precisely a 56 x 56 mm negative.
This results in an almost four times higher resolution than with a 35 mm negative (3136 mm2 compared to 864).
The wildlife is one of the most difficult motifs for a photographer. For this type of photography you need both luck and patience, experience and good equipment.
Wild animal photography is often accepted as given, but as with other photography, a picture says more than a thousand words.
Wild animal photography often requires long telephoto lenses, although other lenses are required for motifs such as a flock of birds or a small living creature.
Many exotic animals are difficult to detect and in some parks there are regulations for photography for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be either shy or aggressive, and the environment can be cold, hot or otherwise hostile.
There are over 5,000 different languages in the world, including more than twenty with 50 million or more speakers.
Written words are often easier to understand than spoken words. This is especially true for addresses where a clear pronunciation is often difficult.
Many nations speak English fluently, and even more countries can expect limited English skills, especially among younger people.
Imagine a person from Manchester, one from Boston, one from Jamaica and one from Sydney sitting together at a restaurant in Toronto.
They enjoyed each other's stories from their hometowns, presented in their distinctive accents and local jargons.
Buying food at the supermarket is usually the cheapest way to get full. However, without cooking facilities, the choice is limited to ready-made dishes.
Supermarkets receive an increasing variety of ready meals. Some even offer microwaves and other methods to warm up food.
In some countries or shops, there is at least one local restaurant, which is often rather informal and affordable.
Make copies of your policy and the contact details of your insurer and carry them with you.
For consultations/authorisations and applications, they must provide the insurer's e-mail address and international telephone numbers.
Keep another copy in your luggage and online (e-mail to yourself with attachment or stored in the "Cloud").
If you are travelling with a laptop or tablet, create a copy in the memory or on the hard drive (which is available without internet).
Also provide copies of the insurance/contact details to fellow travellers and relatives or friends at home who are willing to help.
Mooses are not aggressive by nature, but defend themselves when they perceive a threat.
People who do not regard the moose as a potential threat can get too close to him and put themselves in danger.
Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation. Alcohol affects everyone differently and it is very important to know your own limit.
Possible long-term health problems caused by excessive alcohol consumption may include liver damage and even blindness and death, and the potential risk is increased by the use of illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal spirits can contain various dangerous impurities, including methanol, which can lead to blindness or death even in small doses.
Glasses can be cheaper in other countries, especially in low-income countries where wage costs are lower.
Consider doing an eye examination in your home country, especially if it is covered by the insurance, and then redeem the prescription in another country.
High-quality brand versions available in such areas may have two problems - some may be counterfeits, the real ones imported may be more expensive than in their own country.
Coffee is one of the world's most traded goods and you can probably find many different varieties in your home region.
Nevertheless, there are many different ways of drinking coffee around the world that you should experience.
Canyoning (also known as ravines) is about getting into the bottom of a gorge that is either dry or full of water.
Elements of canyoning are swimming, climbing and jumping – but it has relatively low requirements for training and physical condition for beginners (for example compared to rock climbing, sport diving and alpine skiing).
Hiking is an outdoor activity that consists in walking in nature, often on hiking trails.
Day hikes include distances from less than a mile to longer distances that can be travelled in a single day.
For a day hike on a simple route it does not take much preparation and anyone who is reasonably fit can enjoy it.
Families with small children may need more preparation, but an outdoor day is also easily feasible with babies and preschool children.
Worldwide there are almost 200 running tour organizations. Most of them work independently.
Go Running Tours, the successor of Global Running Tours, connects dozens of Sightrunning providers on four continents.
With roots in Barcelona's Running Tours Barcelona and Copenhagen's Running Copenhagen, it quickly gained growth through Running Tours Prague in Prague and others.
There are many things you need to consider before and during a trip.
Don't expect things to be just like "home" when you travel, and manners, laws, food, transportation, accommodation, standards, spade, and so on will be to a certain extent different from where you live.
This is something you should always keep in mind to avoid disappointment or even dislike of local practices.
Travel agencies have existed since the 19th century. A travel consultant is usually a good choice for trips that go beyond the traveller's previous experience in terms of nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
Although most agencies are willing to accept most regular bookings, many agents specialize in certain types of travel, price ranges or destinations.
It can be more useful to use a travel consultant who often book trips similar to yours.
Take a look at the trips that the travel agent advertises on the website or in a shop window.
If you want to see the world necessary, because of your lifestyle or as a challenge cost-effective, there are some ways to do this.
You can essentially be divided into two categories: either you work while you are travelling, or you try to reduce your expenses. This article focuses on the latter.
For those who are willing to do without comfort, time and planability to reduce spending almost to zero, see Travel with minimal budget.
The advice presupposes that travellers do not steal, break their homes, engage in black market activities, beg or otherwise take advantage of other people.
An immigration checkpoint is usually the first station when you get out of an airplane, ship or other vehicle.
Some cross-border trains carry out checks on the moving train and you should have a valid identification card with you when you board one of these trains.
In night trains the passes can be collected by the conductor so that your sleep is not interrupted.
Registration is another necessity in the visa procedure. In some countries, you need to report your presence and address to the local authorities.
This means, for example, filling out a form with the local police or presenting it to the immigration authority.
In many countries with such a law, local hotels take care of registration (don't forget to ask for it).
If necessary, only travellers who do not live in accommodation for tourists must register. However, this makes the law much more unclear, so you should inform yourself before starting the trip.
The architecture is concerned with the planning and construction of buildings. The architecture of a place is often a tourist attraction in itself.
Many buildings are very beautiful to look at and the view from a high building or from a cleverly positioned window can prove to be beautiful.
Architecture largely overlaps with other disciplines, including urban planning, construction, decorative art, spatial design and landscape design.
Considering how remote many of the Pueblos are, you won't find any significant nightlife if you don't travel to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the casinos listed above serve drinks and some of them invite well-known entertainment artists (mainly the big casinos in the immediate vicinity of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Caution: The small town pubs in this area are not always suitable places to visit for guests from outside.
On the one hand, northern New Mexico has significant problems with driving under the influence of alcohol. In the vicinity of small-town bars, the concentration of drunk drivers is particularly high.
Unwanted murals or smears are known as graffiti.
Although it is anything but a modern phenomenon, most people probably associate it with young people who destroy public and private property with spray paint.
"Today, however, there are established graffiti artists, graffiti events and "legal" walls. In this context, graffiti paintings are more often like works of art than unreadable scribbles."
Boomerang throwing is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang so that it comes back to your hand, make sure you have a suitable boomerang.
Most boomerangs that are available in Australia do not actually return. Beginners should try not to throw in windy weather.
A Hāngi dish is cooked in a hot ground hole.
The pit is heated with hot stones from a fire or in some places by geothermal heat, where the ground is naturally hot.
Hangi is often used to prepare a traditional fried dinner.
Several locations in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi, while other hangi can be tasted in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail has two classes of commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also referred to as first class) and Metro (called third class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded, but a little more expensive – albeit still cheaper than regular underground tickets in Europe.
Each train has both MetroPlus and Metro cars. The MetroPlus cars are always at the end of the train, which is closest to Cape Town.
Wear for others – never lose sight of your luggage, especially if you cross international borders.
You could be used as a drug messenger without knowing what's causing you a lot of trouble.
This includes waiting in line, since drug detection dogs could be used at any time without notice.
In some countries, even for the first time, there are extremely draconian penalties, which may include prison sentences of over 10 years or the death penalty.
Unattended pockets are a target for thieves and can also attract the attention of authorities who fear bomb threats.
At home, you are most likely immune to local germs, as you are constantly exposed to them.
However, in other parts of the world where the bacteriological fauna is new to you, you will encounter problems much sooner.
In warmer climates, bacteria also grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
Hence the scourges of Delhi Belly, the Pharaoh's curse, Montezuma's revenge and her many friends.
Like breathing problems in cold climates, intestinal problems are quite widespread in hot climates. In most cases, they are very annoying, but rather harmless.
If you are travelling to a developing country – or a new part of the world – for the first time, you should not underestimate how much the cultural shock can be.
Many stable, capable travellers have already been overwhelmed by the diversity of travel in developing countries, where the many small cultural differences can quickly add up.
Especially in the first few days, you should consider using hotels, food and services with Western character and quality to facilitate acclimatisation.
Do not sleep on a mattress or mat on the ground in areas where you do not know the local wildlife.
If you are camping outdoors, you should take a folding bed or hammock with you to protect yourself from snakes, scorpions, etc.
Fill your home with a delicious morning coffee and some relaxing chamomile tea in the evening.
When you are on holiday at home, you have the time to go well and invest a few more minutes to brew something special.
If you want a little more adventure, take the chance to make smoothies more juicy or mix them:
You may find a simple drink that you can prepare for breakfast when you have returned to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a varied drinking culture, go to bars or pubs in neighbourhoods you don't often visit.
For those who know little about medical jargon: The terms infectious and contagious have different meanings.
An infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen such as a virus, a bacterium, a fungus or other parasites.
A contagious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted when you are in the vicinity of an infected person.
Many governments demand that incoming visitors or departing residents in their countries be vaccinated against a number of diseases.
These conditions often depend on which countries a holidaymaker has already visited or which he wants to visit.
One of the strengths of Charlotte (North Carolina) is that there is a wealth of high-quality offers for families.
Residents from other areas often say that family friendliness is the main reason for their move, and visitors with children feel very comfortable in the city.
Over the last 20 years, the selection of child-friendly options in Uptown Charlotte has grown exponentially.
Taxis are usually not used by families in Charlotte, although they can be useful under certain circumstances.
There is an additional charge for more than 2 passengers, which may make this choice more expensive than necessary.
The Antarctic surrounding the South Pole is the coldest place on earth.
Tourist visits are expensive, require physical fitness, can only take place in summer (Nov–Feb) and are mostly limited to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
A few thousand employees live here in the summer in about four dozen bases, mainly in these areas; a small number remain over the winter.
The Antarctic inland is a solitary plateau covered with 2–3 km of ice.
Occasional specialized flight tours lead inland, to mountaineering or to the pole, where there is a large research station.
The South Pole Traverse (also known as the Highway) is a 1,600 km long road from the McMurdo station on the Ross Sea to the Pole.
The road surface is planed snow. Columns are filled with snow and marked with flags. The road can only be driven by special tractors that pull sleighs with fuel and supplies behind them.
These are not very agile, so the road around the Transantarctic Mountains has to make a wide arc to get to the plateau.
The most common cause of accidents in winter are slippery roads, pavements and, above all, steps.
They need at least shoes with suitable soles. Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, even some winter boots are insufficient.
The profile should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inches) or more, and the material soft enough even at low temperatures.
Some boots have studs and for slippery conditions there is additional equipment with studs for the heels or heels and sole, which are suitable for most shoes and boots.
The heels should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) are often scattered on roads or roads to improve soil adhesion.
Avalanche is not an anomaly; steep slopes can only hold a certain amount of snow and the excess amount comes down as avalanches.
The problem is, the snow adheres. Therefore, it needs a trigger for the snow to come down. Some falling snow can be the triggering event for the rest.
Sometimes the original trigger is the sun that warms the snow, sometimes it is further snowfall, sometimes other natural events, often a human being.
A tornado is a swirling column of air with very low pressure, which sucks in and causes the surrounding air to rise.
They generate strong winds (often 100-200 miles/hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air and swirl around.
They begin as funnels sinking from storm clouds and become "tornados" when they touch the ground.
Personal VPN providers (virtual private network) are an excellent way to bypass both political censorship and commercial IP geofilters.
They are superior to web proxies for various reasons: they redirect all internet traffic, not just http.
They usually offer higher bandwidths and better performance quality. They are encrypted and therefore more difficult to spy on.
"The media companies regularly lie about the intention behind it and claim that it serves to "prevent piracy."
Rather, the regional code has no effect at all on the pirated copying. The bit-for-bit copy of a CD runs without problems on all devices on which the original runs.
The real purpose is to give these companies more control over their markets; it's all about profit.
Since the calls are routed via the Internet, you do not need to use a telephone company located at your place of residence or travel.
It is also not necessary that you get a local number from the community you live in. You can get an Internet connection via satellite in the wilderness of Chicken in Alaska and select a number that indicates that you are in sunny Arizona.
In many cases, you have to buy a global number separately, which you can call via the public telephone network. Where the number comes from makes a difference for the people you call.
Real-time text translation apps – apps that are capable of automatically translating entire sections of one text from one language to another.
Some of the applications in this category can even translate foreign-language texts on signs or other objects in the real world when the user points the smartphone at these objects.
Translation machines have dramatically improved their performance and now often provide more or less correct translations (and rare gibberish). Nevertheless, caution is needed as they may still misunderstand everything.
One of the most prominent apps in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation after downloading the data of the desired language.
Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone is probably the easiest and most practical way to find your way out of your home country.
This can save money, as you do not have to buy new maps for a navigation device or a separate navigation device or rent one from a rental company.
Your performance may be limited or unavailable if you do not have a data connection to your phone or if it is out of range.
Each corner shop is filled with a confusing selection of prepaid phone cards that can be used for payphones or regular phones.
While most tickets can be used anywhere, some are only used to provide favourable rates for certain groups of countries.
These services are often accessible via a free telephone number, which can be called from most phones without any fees.
The rules for normal photography also apply to video recordings, perhaps even more.
If it is not allowed to photograph something, then you should not even think about recording a video of it.
If you are using a drone, you should check well in advance what you are allowed to film and what permits or additional licenses are required.
Flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it is not illegal in its territory.
Nowadays, air travel is rarely booked directly with the airline without prior search and price comparison.
Sometimes the same flight can have extremely different prices on different booking pages. Therefore, it pays to compare search results before booking and also to check the airline’s website itself.
Even if you do not need a visa for short visits to certain countries as a tourist or for business, entry as an international student usually requires a longer stay than if you only travel as an ordinary tourist.
In general, a long-term stay in a foreign country requires the prior application for a visa.
Student visas generally have different requirements and application procedures than normal tourist or business visas.
For most countries, you will need a written offer from the institution you want to study at, and also proof that you have the means to keep yourself watered at least in your first year of study.
Inform the institution and the immigration authority of the country in which you want to study about the individual requirements.
If you are not a diplomat, when working abroad, it is generally so that you must submit your income tax return in the country where you are resident.
Income tax is structured differently in different countries and tax rates and classes vary greatly from one country to another.
In some federally organized countries, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is levied at both federal and local levels, so tax rates and groups may differ from region to region.
While there is normally no entry control on arrival in your home country or this is merely a formality, customs control can be a nuisance.
Make sure you know what you can and can't introduce, and specify everything that goes beyond the legal limits.
The easiest way to get an introduction to travel literature is to refine your skills on an established travel blog website.
If you are used to formatting and editing online, you may also be able to create your own website later.
Voluntary work on travel is a great way to change something, but it's not just about giving something.
Living in a foreign country and volunteering is a great way to get to know another culture, meet new people, learn about yourself, see things from a different perspective and even learn new skills.
It can also be a good way to increase your budget in order to make a longer stay possible, because many volunteer services include food and lodging and some pay a small fee.
The Vikings used the Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Some of these routes can still be used today. A special permit may be required to use them. It is not always easy to obtain them.
The White Sea-Baltic waterway links the North Polar Sea with the Baltic Sea via the Onegasee, Ladoga Sea and Saint Petersburg, mostly via rivers and lakes.
The Onegasee is also connected to the Volga, so that it is still possible to arrive from the Caspian Sea through Russia.
Be assured that everything will be pretty clear as soon as you reach the docks. You will meet other boat tramps who will share their knowledge with you.
Basically, you will offer your help, walk around the docks, approach people who clean their yachts, contact sailors in the bar, etc.
Try talking to as many people as possible. After a while, everyone knows you and you will get tips on which boat is looking for someone.
You should carefully select your frequent flyer airline in an alliance.
Even if you might think that you should instinctively take the airline with which you fly the most, you should note that the advantages offered are often different. Frequent flyer points could be more generous with another airline with the same connection.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their flights to Africa and, compared to European airlines, have connections to numerous major African cities at low prices.
From 2014, Turkish Airlines will fly to 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have extra time to travel, check out how all your travel expenses to Africa are compared to the cost of a world trip.
Do not forget to include the extra costs for additional visas, departure fees, transportation on land, etc. for all the places outside of Africa.
If you want to completely circumnavigate the world in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is very limited due to the lack of trans-ocean routes.
No aviation alliance covers all three ocean crossings in the southern hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not offer any of these connections).
However, Star Alliance covers everything outside the eastern southern Pacific from Santiage de Chile to Tahiti, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
This flight is not the only option if you want to skip the South Pacific and the South American west coast. (see below)
In 1994, the ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh waged war against the Azerbaijanis in Azerbaijan.
With Armenian support, a new republic was founded, but it does not officially recognise an established country – even Armenia.
Diplomatic disputes over the region continue to cloud relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The canal belt (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is the famous 17th-century district that encompasses Amsterdam's city centre.
The entire district has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its unique cultural and historical value and its real estate values are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, which means five countries, includes the five small coastal villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso in the Italian region of Liguria.
You are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, up to the cliffs that lie directly above the sea, terraces were carefully built into the rough, sloping terrain.
Its charm also includes the fact that there are no visible commercial buildings. The villages are connected by paths, trains and boats and there are no cars coming in from outside.
The variants of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from those spoken in France, but are similar enough to be understandable to both sides.
In particular, the French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland have some minor peculiarities which differ from the French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words is also slightly different.
Nevertheless, it can be assumed that all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss have learned standard French at school and you understand, even if you use the normal French counting system.
In many parts of the world, waving is a kind gesture that signals a "hello".
"However, it means "come here" in Malaysia, or at least among the Malays in rural areas, similar to curving the index finger towards the body, a gesture that is used in some Western countries, and should only be used for this purpose."
Similarly, a British traveller in Spain may misunderstand a wave of farewell, in which the palm of his hand is facing the wave (and not the person who is waved) as a gesture of return.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages created with the aim of facilitating communication between peoples who would otherwise be difficult to communicate.
They differ from the so-called Linguae Francae, natural or organic languages, which for various reasons become predominant as a means of communication between speakers of other languages.
In the heat of the day, travelers can experience mirages that convey the illusion of water (or other things).
These can be dangerous if the traveler tracks the air level and wastes valuable energy and the rest of his water.
Even in the hottest deserts, it can get extremely cold at night. Without warm clothing, undercooling is a real danger.
Especially in summer they have to be careful of mosquitoes if they want to walk through the rainforest.
Even if you drive through the subtropical rainforest by car, a few seconds with open doors are enough to take mosquitoes into the car.
Bird flu, or rather avian influenza, can infect both birds and mammals.
In humans there are less than a thousand documented cases, but some of them were fatal.
Most of the cases involved people working with poultry, but there is also a certain risk for birdwatchers.
Steep fjords and valleys, which unexpectedly merge into a high, more or less flat plateau, are typical of Norway.
These plateaus are often referred to as "vidde", which means as much as a wider, open, treeless space, a boundless expanse.
In Rogaland and Agder it is usually called "hei", meaning a treeless moorland, often covered with heather.
The glaciers are not stable, but flow down the mountain. This creates cracks and crevices that can be covered by snow bridges.
The walls and ceilings of ice caves can collapse and cracks close.
On the edge of glaciers, huge blocks break down, fall down, and may jump or roll further away from the edge.
The tourist season for the hill stations usually reaches its peak during the Indian summer.
However, in winter they have a different kind of beauty and magic. Numerous mountain stations have a lot of snow and have activities such as skiing and snowboarding on offer.
Few airlines still offer death rates with a small discount on a last-minute trip to a funeral.
Airlines offering these services include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights from the USA or Canada, and Westjet.
In any case, you need to book by telephone via the airline.
