The Prague Stock Exchange plunges into a negative position against the closing of the business.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions in the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of normal day-to-day business.
At the beginning of Tuesday's business, the Prague Stock Exchange followed the fall of Monday when it fell by a further six percentage points.
This time the reason for the break-in was Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote by the US House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector there.
Case of shares in Asia
On Tuesday, the stock exchanges in Asia experienced a dramatic case, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
The index of the Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but was later able to offset some of the losses, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which observes the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, declined by 3.8 percent, while markets in Shanghai were closed.
The shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan declined by 3.6 percent according to the index there.
"The timing of the rescue operation in the US is uncertain and will affect the financial markets worldwide," said Hong Kong's chief monetary authority, Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft financial system support.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the collapse.
A Bloodbath of American Stocks
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
In Bush's view, the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the entire economy.
The American stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the biggest slump in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, with a similar decline last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any signs that the draft would not get through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes concession: U.S. government is allowed to pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the American financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
American legislators made a breakthrough in discussions about the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of a $700 billion grant to the American financial system (about $12 trillion).
However, this does not mean victory.
Congressmen still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The financial support plan will be negotiated in the US Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
According to various figures, the plan could probably not be voted on at the earliest on Wednesday in the Senate.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first significant psychological factor in stimulating financial markets.
After that, however, there was a "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms that could help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package to stabilise the market should look like," said the Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the agency Bloomberg.
According to her, a final vote could be held on Sunday.
Legislators met US Secretary of State Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets from financial companies, which plunge the financial firms into heavy losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must be effective on the market.
You have to continue with the recovery plan, but I think we're at the finish line," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Democratic Nevada Senator Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
The aim is to reassure investors against transactions on Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a decision of the congress could influence the business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, nor is there any clarity as to whether the negotiations could fail at the last minute due to a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
But the law will undergo some changes.
The total amount of aid to the scheme is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
Congress, however, can block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, with another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush Positively Appreciates Progress in Negotiations
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, Congress can overrule its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has remained, which was based on obtaining finance for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and "estimated the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate, Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, stated that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law also aims to restrict the golden parachutes for directors of companies involved in the programme and sets up a committee to oversee the fund.
This is to be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and achieved great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new mortgage rates that it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance's chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but implementation is very difficult.
"That is because we do not know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses among themselves," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
In Marek's view, whether the plan will be adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not decisive.
"More importantly, Congressmen agree to support the plan and say goodbye to it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on adoption is the most important thing at this moment," Marek stressed.
Duel on Messer's edge: MP3 player against cell phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call yet.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to just buy a phone.
Despite all this, there are enough reasons why you should gain an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
It's hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with kind of rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one.
This is also the case with music on travels, i.e. with compressed music, simply put - music in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand kroner on a player, but a Pink-Floyd fan will hardly be able to handle headphones for twenty kroner from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
The lifetime of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play a lot more than just music, but what mobile phones can do they can't even make a hint.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, phone calls and sims, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better camera, sometimes a worse one, and may also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also entails disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy eaters.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten-twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are much more powerful.
That's why you should expect cheap phones to be able to play music for no longer than a few hours.
If you then occasionally still call, you prefer to buy a charger for the office for safety - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good will keep at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one charge off.
Another problem is when you want to transfer the music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB end, besides, not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers can handle the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones without any reduction.
With players, you do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, arranged by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can do both (iiver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can use more
When selecting a specific device, you should in particular ask about the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of sound and of course also the ease of use.
If music is mainly a backdrop for you and if you listen to it every day only briefly in the tram, for example, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
Which almost every cell phone can do.
You also don't have to control which music formats a mobile phone or a player can process.
MP3 will create everyone, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most widely used, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also make it possible to buy music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can purchase a song or album.
This service can in itself be a powerful argument for why you should buy a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is poor and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of sale of music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry the phone with them.
If you feel like listening to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player is lying at home forgotten.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can fall back on the built-in speaker that almost every mobile phone has, but only a few MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of the music phones will be in the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand kroner.
For three and four thousand crowns, you'll get a decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players lies in the ease of use.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - players can really be operated by everyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player, is obvious.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horrendous invoice for data transmission.
Which device should you grab now
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g.Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are sufficient.
But attention.
For the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive ones can read 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then go for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you don't have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be among the more sophisticated handsets, rather take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have standalone control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use can thus be compared to that of a single MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman mobile phones have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold individually, is the most widely used.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) provide you MP3 players from the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech suppliers offer practically all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe this one won't be waiting long.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that Czech mobile operators work at the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the ČTÚ telecommunications authority, which pointed out that the price of a text message is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the European Commission's final steps in the area of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a fight announcement.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, because in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and penetration of far more than 100 %.
On the other hand, mobile operators like to complain that there is an extremely high level of competition on the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who had often said in the past that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic, often agrees with this.
It is probably true that a traditional provider with its own network no longer has a lot of opportunities (by the way, it would probably hardly find frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile phone market brought a significant price reduction, to which then also the classic mobile phone providers had to react.
Even before the entry of companies like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in Great Britain, there were voices similar to those in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, you don't have to look for examples long.
In February this we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider has managed to attract more than 100 thousand customers and thus become the country's fifth largest provider.
Behind Mobilking stands the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon among other things in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a traditional provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually emerge as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, but this is often accompanied by a less comprehensive range of services.
For example, in the UK, Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be quite a good move to focus on a non-cliche target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose mobileking - the provider they like and who they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could also gain a foothold in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone Miroslav Čepický's press spokesman also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the provision of services."
In the Czech Republic, mobile phone providers say no chance
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile operator conquers the Czech Republic, it will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look particularly hopeful.
Mobilking will be more likely to enter the market in other countries in our region," says Jana Studničková, Spokesperson of the Penta Financial Group in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
For some time now, the GTS Novera group has shown its interest in launching a virtual mobile provider, which wants to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the corporate banking sector.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-line, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this option with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already achieved progress in negotiations with some of them," said the press spokesman of the Pavel Kaidl group.
Maybe better times are coming.
Non-official information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specificities compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also point to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile's press spokesperson Martina Kemrová adds, in rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project to build on."
And she adds: "There will hardly be a virtual provider on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this moment, we should already have a concrete offer in order to be able to think this way in the short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický comments: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is precisely what we consider the best from the point of view of our customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider would mean more competition, this would lead to lower prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
So why make market entry easier for such a competitor?
The fact that the providers can pull together when it comes to something also proves the long back and forth about the emergence of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards ČTÚ was at the moment when U:fon came on the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This is also demonstrated by the publicly available information from the ČTÚ websites.
But now U:fon is a good argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, on its services."
However, in view of this approach by mobile operators, the Czech regulatory authorities’ absolute lack of interest is surprising.
It is not just the attitude of ČTÚ, which unfortunately, unlike the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries, does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
The Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS) is the sole owner of the Office.
This, however, related to this whole problem its very typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile operator would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile operator and a virtual provider by renting the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classical suppliers", said Kristián Chalupa of the External Relations Department of the ÚOHS in his reply to our request.
Such a formulation would not surprise suppliers’ representatives.
This is more than worrying from an authority representing consumer interests, including ensuring that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries, where virtual providers work quite normally, it can be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not part of the interests of the ÚOHS.
What is really shocking about this case is the almost touching harmony of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same gasoline price at the petrol stations is surely only a coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs of anti-competitive action in this matter, and therefore has no reason to intervene in the matter in any way.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The telecommunications regulatory authority is likely to lack the necessary tools to open up the mobile communications market to virtual providers," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators holds a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - for the market entry of a virtual provider the approval of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile phone provider - logically - has the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if this argument is not taken into account, it should at least be a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are proceeding remarkably similarly.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the company GTS Novera mentioned above) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The transfer of responsibility to ČTÚ is then quite a common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recent amendment to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the ČTÚ's competences to the field of economic competition in telecommunications has not been achieved, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS need to know all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's all right when no one's looking
First of all, the functioning of some pseudovirtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains ignored.
It is companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partly public.
Usually they are companies that operate in the field of multi-level marketing.
Own mobile telephone services offer for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic company customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which can lead to the termination of the cooperation with the relevant company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question on this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not go around with the operators responsible.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, thousands of customers may be involved.
However, no operator opposes such an approach.
In fact, the activities of these companies do not give them negligible profits, and at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out potential problems: "The law allows for such types of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone does not run in their name, so they cannot have it as full as the normal customers of mobile operators."
But this alone should at least seem strange to the ČTÚ.
There is also another question for the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an approach, why are they blocking themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the provider's declaration that they do not know about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
When Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been stressed several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers resulted in a significant price decrease in the various services.
In virtually all countries where virtual providers have emerged, the traditional providers have tried to prevent their emergence more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies intervened at these very moments, which did not try to protect the interests of mobile operators, but rather those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and others followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators throw themselves at the whole case like a hot potato.
On the basis of our experience, we cannot escape the impression that ambiguities in competences are more than favourable in these cases.
But let us not throw the shotgun into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon start moving again.
If a provider allows the emergence of a virtual mobile service provider, the ÚOHS will not remain idle when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally not make more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented in a ceremony the new recordings of the national anthem where my home country is.
The anthem was re-recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo vocals, in choir version and in an instrumental version.
The vocals were taken over by Kateřina Kn’nková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already told the Czech Radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices for the solo versions, which are striking and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction on both of them and then on with the choir, so that the text can be understood well, so that a harmony can be created," the conductor said.
The Czech national anthem is celebrating its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the stage theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first verse of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound?
Prague transport companies will also be transporting on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1st, 2008, will go down in the history of Prague's transport companies as a date when the first passengers carrying an electronic coupon in their pocket, instead of a paper ticket, will board a metro, tram or bus.
These can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it simultaneously played on their chip card at the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádra
Since yesterday the coupons are also available via the Internet on the websites of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the internet sales can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long queues for their paper tickets.
They buy the coupon via the Internet, which is played on the opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"There is also a desk with trained staff available to travellers at these points, which advises those interested in buying the Internet and also puts the coupon on the card," said the spokesperson of the Martin Opatrný project.
In addition to the libraries, electronic coupons can also be played on the opencard on self-service machines, which are installed in some underground vestibules.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket devaluers, passengers may have noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but it should be eighty by the end of the year," Opatrný adds.
The coupon is controlled by an automatic machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines, which will work from tomorrow, is easy.
All you have to do is insert the chip card, and the coupon you bought before will play itself.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, with which especially the inhabitants from municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia get into the capital.
"In the trains that form part of Prague's integrated transport system, train attendants have readers who can check the validity period of the coupons according to time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the organisation Ropid. This organisation compiles the timetables for Prague's transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the driver's desk.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked point on the side of the checkout.
The driver thus checks the validity of the coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who does not use suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can go to the self-service machines, where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information about the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the US
In 1945 the Sudeten Germans had requested the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This is evident from a letter which is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans are said to have turned to the US President in 1945.
This is evident, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
In the letter the Germans of Krumau ask the American President not to allow the return of the "Sudetungus" - which was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says a letter signed with the words "people to whom the fate of the Sudeten lies at the heart."
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia leads the Sudeten Germans - in knowledge of the Czech national character - to suspect that they would expect brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protection over the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We can't believe that without regard to the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you promised a state that is foreign to us, which suppresses and tries to eliminate minorities and has contributed absolutely nothing to the victory of the Allies" is read in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the US President had doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he in the Böhmerwaldgau initiated a referendum on whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the USA or live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, according to some contemporary witnesses, however, it paints a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even if the Bohemian Germans at least had to suspect that they would negotiate their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed that they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was employed as a Budweiser German in the Baltic Sea Navy during the war.
When he came into British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner of war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would fit them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected him to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers
Expensive action on safety on the streets in Czech history.
It would also be possible to characterize the emotion-laden media campaign that the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Aleš řáebíček’s authority promises to turn drivers away from dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will be on TV, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is designed to dissuade drivers from driving too fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remind you to strap up before you get on the road.
The campaign wants to talk young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers into the conscience.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also confirmed by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a license plate.
And then in a pool of blood the word "pay" stands.
This means that you can pay for a moment of inattentiveness with your own life.
The spots will "shock" the audience by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see pictures with drastic shots of accident victims.
It is expected that this will reduce the number of accidents and the number of road fatalities on Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Carrot and whip for drivers
"For the drivers, the motto is carrot and whip.
Carrots mean that if they drive red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk", says the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, even less effective are boards that alert the drivers to a danger.
"If you set up a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow into the environment, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the temporary Israeli government Ehud Olmert has advocated the return of virtually all areas occupied in 1967, including the Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace could be established in exchange for Palestine and Syria.
He stressed this in an interview, which was printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Achorot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He acknowledged that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to do without part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in allusion to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Templar and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Deduction from the Golan Heights
Olmert called for Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights, which he felt is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," said Olmert.
"The Syrians know only too well what to do without to get the Golan Heights back.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the jihad (Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister explained.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards in the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know them, in a long-distance bus it's not allowed to walk around
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus operated by the Student Agency company near the Italian Padua, the question arises as to whether stewards and travellers are allowed to go back and forth during the journey on the bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road transport," said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, in which a twenty-two-year-old stewardess died last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus.
At that moment, the young woman sat next to the driver in the least safe place in the car, even though she had two more seats available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or a sharp brake at the moment when the steward delivers coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is also equipped with standing places according to the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided for in the bus, the passengers must sit.
The long-distance coaches of Student Agency have no standing places; as the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and this did not agree with the movement of travellers at first.
Later this was withdrawn, and we reached a consensus that passengers may go to the toilet while driving if they have their seat," he informed his point of view.
The law does not know a steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of a vehicle companion, but it does not define its rights and obligations," the spokesman of the Hanzelka Ministry clearly adds.
The director of the Road Vehicles Division of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law covers this problem retrospectively.
"It depends on whether the bus also has standing places in the product approval.
That's all," he stresses.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing places and a higher permitted speed and long-distance coaches without standing places with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the airplane, says the expert
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"There are not many dangers in a liquid mode of driving, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Here, too, it is not certain when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can bump his head."
"However, if a bus stops sharply, the laws of physics apply, of course.
Just like a city bus or a tram.
The carrier must clarify the security of the stewards by means of internal regulations," he says and also thinks that this problem is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company offering services from stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider her profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's profession is risky, I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers are available to travellers when boarding.
That would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin explains the lack of stewards in his buses. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, but we're fighting them right from the start.
Sooner or later, this will end with some fatal accident," he had said not quite a year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy
In the accident of a regular bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region had died, who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck had probably turned off the stand strip without flashing and had blocked the bus's journey.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
Jančura denies that the two seats were sold for the stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but it also expects financial compensation from the guilty party.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more detailed regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation on which a 30-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has already been working for over a year.
"This, however, has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the top speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving," says specialist Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the work of the stewards to be something that could significantly endanger the safety of passengers," said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses being the competence of the police and the health and safety authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB Board of Management to the staff of the House does not lack great words.
By merging the units of the Düsseldorfer Geldinstitut with the Frankfurter Deka-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" could be created," according to the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
In general, such a link could be the decisive stimulus to further bundling in the Landesbanken sector.
This is how it is read when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalian state government has only recently made clear, the time is pressing to find a future solution.
A connection between Deka-Bank, which savings bank customers know about because of their investment funds, as always, and WestLB has been talking about for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank CEO Franz Waas informed us at the end of August when he presented the half-year figures, he sees no sense in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, which is supported half by the Landesbanken and the Sparkassenverbanden, has instructed the Management Board to conduct discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have, however, just begun, according to the financial centre.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the more important employers at the Frankfurt financial centre, is not mentioned for the first time when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
For a moment in 2003, it looked as if the Deka Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing became of this triad.
As soon as the plans had become public, the Hessian state government spoke out against Helaba's participation in it.
Neither did the other two houses find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been thought games about a connection of the Deka bank with Landesbanken.
Last, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Helaba, had spoken out against simulation games about going together with his house.
Regardless of this, however, the realization seems to mature that a clash of the various houses of the public-law sector is in need.
Now that the state election in Bavaria is over, a connection between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could move closer.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, the partners gradually run out of money for it.
In the south, she would only be junior partners, although she has been through the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 85 percent stake in Helaba, put a stop to a meeting with the West LB at the beginning of the year.
At best, stay the North LB.
But such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, it is about the question of how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question of which business model should ensure the future viability of the Landesbanken had not been answered by the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giroverband so far.
In the end, there could also be a dismantling of the West LB, which is, of course, not wanted there.
Thus, the letter from the local board of directors also mentions that a "total solution" for the house is in any case sought.
How this can be reconciled with the merger of individual units with the Deka Bank will be demonstrated.
The second Wiesn weekend is known as the "Italian weekend"
It's the first time for Elena, the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearded tiger and proves the about 200 Oktoberfest travellers how deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a slap first, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From here, the bus parking space next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", will start this evening at 11:45 p.m., arriving expected at 6:30 a.m.
Three buses are reserved especially for Italians, only Brazilians travel in one bus.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans already sing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, it's not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur imitation lining and glasses with wide silver handles, belongs to the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, at 10.30 p.m. back.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed according to the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and the German speaking travel guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada towards "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly it will be quiet on the bus, the travelers sleep.
All right, they're gonna need their powers.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian license plates take a break on the motorway 8 just before Munich, there will be a stop.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all, put on the yellow cap.
On the left is "Oktoberfest", in Fraktur, next to the internet address of Marcos travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors open to the beer tent, it's going to run!", Marco calls into the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the rear part of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, spread in the room!"
The measure, Marco yells, cost 8.25 euros.
And don't forget tips.
"The security people show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they're gone!"
Three: "Tonight, we'll have point 11 here again."
And we'll go to the Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cap binds to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be prepared for retreat.
It is the second Wiesn weekend, known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no exact figures; there are 50 000 people on their way across the Alps and entering the beer tents; ten percent of all visitors are said to have come from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police force is strengthened by seven policemen from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which carries a national statistics in which the Italians take first place in front of the British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical care.
The Hofbräuzelt is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück emphasised last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relatively" and also intertwined that the German banking sector was not spared from the crisis-ridden developments.
Because this has now occurred on the weekend.
The Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed in the Dax, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday that the loans amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only had to pay interest on the part it also claimed.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is loss of daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he lent money, the state financier had refinanced itself extremely in the short term - which is no longer possible because of the mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio also declined slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial operations had fallen to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, while income from attributions to receivables and certain securities as well as from the resolution of provisions in the credit business had fallen by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher income from refunds of downstream transfer costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest under the Tax Code and from the business management for Group companies, had the profit margin still moderate at around 16 percent.
The former state financier, after being privatised in 1990, had initially speculated on commercial real estate loans, which had then been phased out in Aareal Bank.
Because there was too little earned in traditional government financing, the Depfa had then become more involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects by private investors and the state (private public partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations on the value of the daughter, which will have a "essential material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, it is quite indeterminate.
The fact is, the dividend has been cancelled.
It had already been reduced by two thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the Depfa takeover.
It is more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market than other institutions, as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among banks has again largely dried up, as banks hoard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funding for a part of Depfa's loan portfolio - around EUR 50 billion - every year.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing needs are covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is "shielded from the influence of the currently largely ineffective international money markets".
From other sources it can be heard that the funds will secure the refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke stated that, on the other hand, Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the market viability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This stands for shareholders and creditors of the bank to hope for.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
In fact, it is not unthinkable that the funding should not be used to the full.
But the opposite is not to be worn out either.
After the late Sunday evening the bank was still facing insolvency, even the at least temporary rescue cannot calm the minds.
The share price drops by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, the bond rates are quite good.
If the primary debt is hardly moving, the price of the subordinated bonds will decline more clearly.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009 are affected.
Once hypo-real-estate bonds appear to be a speculative investment alternative, their value must be considered to depend on the stability of the international financial system, following the significant intensification of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into the house with the takeover of the Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, a timely repayment of pensions can be assumed.
Or it will happen what hardly anyone dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports of partial nationalisation, the probability of security has now become only a legitimate hope.
This is particularly likely to cause long-term believers some sleepless nights with the decision whether to separate themselves from their engagements.
Short-term investors can at least use a closing stroke to make a loss carry forward for the future payback tax payments on price gains of later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start to giggle: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had bammel before I left school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of class at the Tachibana does not seem as strictly fixed as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students enter at eight o'clock, until at twenty to nine a short discussion session with the teacher begins, the 'home room'.
But before class began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
But I'm not the guy who likes to talk to people, even in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I haven't had a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my guest mother, plus a blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the desk and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, comes from Germany and has a birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language about two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all whispered, giggled and waved and constantly I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'nice, sweet'.
Then I quickly rushed to my place.
The girl next to me grinned pretty broad, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really upset.
Everyone talked and giggled and asked me holes in my stomach - but it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their Bentos.
My guest mother had also made me such a lunch box - that's something different than the boring German break breads.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in a tofu coat.
Most of the time, I don't know what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It's clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a self-made Bento, which she then prepares especially artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy during a snack break.
That's what I read in my manga comics.
I'm curious to see if I can watch this too.
'Why Japan of all people?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I used to say:
"Because it fascinates me."
After all, I've loved reading mangas for years.
And so that I could better understand the comics and the culture in it, I also started to learn a little bit of Japanese.
So it was quite clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a passion for tradition, customs and customs.
And that's what you put great value on here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here either, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Even rats have feelings
A rat or a cockroach flees in case of danger, does that mean that she also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Just how could you check if they feel the same way they behave like us?
For several years, contributions by famous scientists have been published in the internet magazine Edge.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we may at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and raise questions of feeling or, more generally, of consciousness, we enter rough terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets in danger, she does the same as many other animals: she turns herself dead, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, which is why some scientists conclude a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in the execution/control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in man than in the other primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, however it may be, probably differ greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it is neither measured nor analysed on the basis of our own experience, because of the special hardware, then its exploration presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be more accessible scientifically.
One could examine the processes of consciousness of animals without regard to their contents, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one shifts rather to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the formation of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I attribute it to the fact that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies memory.
From this point of view, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex that characterize primates, especially humans.
Connected with the linguistic nature, subtle gradations of feeling arise, because with the help of words and grammar we can differentiate and categorize states in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
Antonio Damasio, on the other hand, believes that sensations from more primitive activities in the body-feeling regions of the Cortex and the brain-stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain-stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in cross-genuine sensations.
In theory, I can't disagree with that, but I think it's unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to feel the same in both cases: but how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees in case of danger whether it also feels fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioral similarity cannot yet prove an equal experience.
While the neural comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain strains, cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove it for humans, how did you want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (since the human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is waving at the neural level, as long as one measures the same in rats and humans.
Just as I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, nor feelings, I don't know if they exist.
You may think it's shortsighted, but I'd rather move forward than run against a wall all the time.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or conversion of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts lag behind.
The number of EM stages may even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at maximum speed," said Ukrainian Federation President Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep a constant eye on us."
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the 2012 European Championships will not suffer."
Several first-time players had been sentenced to forced retirement for manipulation in the past season alone, after which even the start of the league had to be postponed in the short term.
Indignant Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about privates in an interview - and is now in trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her lost Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
It foams - and strikes back.
Late Rose War at the ex-marriage Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unpleasant argument with each other - in public.
In an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She found out the extent of the fraud only after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Unbelievable," said the 54-year-old of the New York Daily News, "Meg repeatedly chews and wraps up the story of our relationship."
It is also "deplorable" that the common 16-year-old son Jack is once again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that mean divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
And so his openings close with the side blow: "My life goes on anyway.
I am happy that I have a wonderful family who is doing well."
Prices for flight tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany were even up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, recorded a significant fall in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, overnight stays in many places have already been reduced.
From January to March, prices in 41 of 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most marked in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees this as the cause of the weak dollar rate that has led to a "decreasing travellust of American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even keep the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
In the first quarter, the trend in air fares also showed upward trend:
Due to the increase in kerosene, passengers in the economy class had to pay 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, the prices of Economy class flights fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class, price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, prices have even halved on German domestic flights.
The reason for the drop in prices is on the one hand the declining economic growth, explains the company.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is crumbling.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, increased competitive pressure.
The tense situation was marked by the cancellation of unprofitable routes from airlines and the high number of airlines which had filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV table leader becomes.
At Borussia Luhukay is still unable to find a working elf.
Von Kristoffer Klein enlarge break landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into play late and failed with a lift to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, and it was convincingly passed over his lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," hissed Hermann Rieger in the cabin corridor of the Hamburger Arena.
Much wasn't going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them were back in their seats.
Rieger was HSV's physiotherapist for almost three decades and enjoys a higher reputation than many of the lost actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and lifted his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, head coach of Hamburg.
His command will have been similar: Come with gate two!
Implementation has not been implemented.
"It wasn't all nice to look at today," Marcell Jansen admitted later.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have wanted it "more relaxed".
The 1-0 (1:0) is due to the headball hit of Mladen Petric (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on this Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which pointed out their club as class prime.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify this," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular intermediate certificate stands for the unpredictability of the league more than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with their late-committed entrances - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goal scorer Petric as well as the Jansen recruited by FC Bayern - finds itself slow, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," demanded Jol.
After the vote
On Wall Street, fear is handled.
First news of the failure of the rescue package temporarily broke the Dow Jones by 700 points.
That was the biggest loss of points in a day's history.
Later the Dow caught something again.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer, with a good five percent minus, listed at 10,579 counters.
The technology exchange Nasdaq with more than seven percent in the minus was 1548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about twelve percent.
No title could win.
Goldman Sachs' shares fell by almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the company.
Under the rescue plan, funds will be made available for the purchase of so-called bad mortgages.
However, the sum should not be paid at a single stroke, but step by step.
In return, the State should receive stock option notes from financial companies that could be redeemed if the price changes were to be made in order to reduce the burden on the State Treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the USA downsog
The billions of dollars of aid to banks in Europe and the US do not resolve investors' doubts.
The stock price of the German major bank Hypo Real Estate is falling and tearing down the Dax.
The US index Dow Jones loses despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have brought the German Stock Index (Dax) down deeply.
Despite the bailout by the German government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier's share temporarily lost three quarters of its value, while Commerzbank declined by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped clearly below the psychologically important 6000-point mark and recorded with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Stock markets all over the world went down.
Wall Street opened in New York with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package could not be sufficient to get the financial markets back on track.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points in the first trading hour.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate vote could follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: In London, the FTSE index initially declined by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese leading index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points after initial profits.

Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed the 23 million new shares.
The trading and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook would not be sold.
Dark matter influences flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused perplexity in research: dark matter influences the velocity of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not be quite correct.
For almost 18 years, the "Ulysses" spacecraft flew through space.
Because of soon freezing fuel lines, you are now threatened with cold death.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion for years - the swing-by anomaly.
The swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space probes in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
However, what the researchers have been wondering for years: the missiles do not behave 100 percent the way you would expect them to do according to the ancient law of gravity.
Instead, there are irregularities at speed.
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptised him swing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It obviously has an attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it does not emit and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, dark matter represents at least a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists abducted in Egypt are said to be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The hijackers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
In a shooting before the release, six hostage-takers were reported to have been killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are supposed to be going on.
Again and again, Germans are targeted by kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists abducted in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports from the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We're checking her health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are safe and sound, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: According to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the official.
It was "only about receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the hijackers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The hostage takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, referring to a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of stepfather "leads to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman killing herself and was reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after confessing eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Criminal Court in Truro learned that he bound his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle regularly when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession, "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Mrs. Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her up and blindfolded her before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who volunteered for the National Trust for a large part of her time, was persecuted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been an avid surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "had given up her life"
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended up like this: "I used to tie her up and connect her eyes."
"I didn't force her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise, "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been scary for her victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it had not done so."
He added, "I take note of the effects, according to Stephanie's father and mother, of her actions over the years on her daughter.
Otherwise, she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in one train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Act".
The man was seconded to the Department of Defense when he lost two highly confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest indictment within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be dealt with internally at the Ministry of Defense and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned is charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor's Office recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he transferred contained classified assessments of Al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies face B&B costs
British housing companies could face costs of more than £80 million after rescuing Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "unbearable" that the companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid once Bradford & Bingley's loans have been redeemed.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is charged to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits each year.
The financial compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted prudently ... are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies would have to pay together about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies have to raise £81 million for the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Companies, informed the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted prudently during the real estate upswing are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives are available to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest is due for a full year, and that could be almost twice as much.
As construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk gets five pence per litre more expensive
The people of Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consulting firm have been carried out.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Their defenders said that the court refused bail regarding the charge of having extorted 50 million Taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several pending charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government first grant her unrestricted freedom.
The correspondents say that even though her detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear, as part of her release, whether she will be able to stay free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers state that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says she doesn't need to get a bail, as she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a legal complaint against the upper court."
Her lawyers claim that she needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after October 17th, said an Awami Alliance party chairman on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears about the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or hinder the thousands of immunization workers.
BskyB loses action in the ITV case
BskyB has lost its action against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competing channel ITV.
The Competition Appeals Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyB's share distorts competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB’s purchase of the stake in ITV raised doubts about the independence of ITV, which led the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communication Office of Ofcom have opposed the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, in particular because BskyB had announced that it would give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the dismissal of the nine prosecutors in the U.S. in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice criticising the actions of the administration staff.
The report criticised the White House officials, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
The Special Investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officers interrogated during the investigation have lied to the investigators in order to hinder the judiciary.
Serious allegations, including criminal charges, have not been fully investigated or clarified, said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appeal of a special investigator with the authority to force the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice removed nine U.S. prosecutors from office in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that prosecutors were dismissed due to poor work.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to consider the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial prosecution of high-ranking Republican Congressional members, while others refused to investigate the allegations of Democratic electoral fraud.
US prosecutors are tasked with investigating and pursuing judicial cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be withdrawn for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, has been under fire because of the dismissals and has ultimately resigned from office.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In particular, the Inspector General's report raised the role of Gonzales critically by having assumed the "main responsibility" for dismissals, "discontinuing" his leadership role, and having shown himself "unusually disinterested" in the trial.
Other officials, including former Chief Adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for their lack of cooperation with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award "Q Award" for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who next week in London will accept his special gold prize during the award ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's awards, after having been selected in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there are some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years on the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, one of which was an operation in 2003 for irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to acute laryngitis.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon for sale
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues, side streets and other bypasses, some of which are famous and others just convenient.
Nevertheless, even experienced taxi drivers and long-standing locals find it difficult to tell where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used thoroughfare.
There are no road signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to reflate Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alleyway, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the block of houses.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and for the road, has no interest in maintaining them.
During a meeting of the Municipal Council's Land Use Committee this month, representatives of the City Council and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal for the construction company to purchase the road.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the street remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district manager in the municipal council 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, what Avalon could do, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it will re-patch the small street and set up seats designed, among other things, for a café to which the company would like to rent out space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the road, it did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decayed alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city had proposed the sale itself.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Building Protection Department, said that it was actually the city's desire to sell the street and stressed that the department's task was to develop the real estate rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802 when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between its numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument that was closed in 2006, opened to the extra place and the street is probably most well known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property should remain public as modest as it is.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splinter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the Dying City"), has published a part of the conversation in city history about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end, which even remains dark during the day and is characterized by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and weekly newspapers flying past rain gutters."
With a few exceptions, the road looked just like that recently in one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti could be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the street could be polished up a bit.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the road in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: education in English-speaking environments
In this issue of the "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, Senior Researcher in California Studies and Senior Director in the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs a School Selection".
Addressing the Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the probability of Afro-American and Hispanic students successfully completing school is lower than that of white students" - which is true.
To close this gap, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends a bilingual transition in education for those learning English.
Nevertheless, the question to Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Take Sixth Street Prep, a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently been in the country, are learning English.
Nevertheless, in 2008 amazing 100 percent of fourth grade students passed the state exam in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth school year were rated as good in the English exam.
This amazing success has been achieved by other methods than those preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street school focuses on checking and practice, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach of training in an English-speaking environment, which is exactly what Obama is supposed to observe, says headmaster Linda Mikels.
This approach focuses on the almost exclusive use of the English language in technical instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later, they would enter the classroom and no longer recognize him.
"It works," she noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The achievements of the school would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within his own party (the national pictorial associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about legislation aimed at "English only".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices are falling as a result of renewed fears for the economy
The oil price fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the American bailout plan for the financial markets could not suffice to revive the economy.
The crude oil futures on the New York Stock Exchange fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
Over the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil on Wall Street and by strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the July price peaked at $145.29 per barrel, they dropped to nearly $90 per barrel this month, then rose again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors showed concern again, even though congressional representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan this weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, the Citigroup is supposed to buy up the banking business of the Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it has not been possible to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Analysts from Deutsche Bank have written in a communication to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe that they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US American virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The Bank’s analysts have revised downwards their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and lowered their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Internal defender Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything after he'd been in the Jets jersey more often than anyone in the last eight and a half years.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter, in which the jets turned an inconclusive game into a triumphal move.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
After a sloppy match between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which was the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect start to an afternoon when their evolving collaboration made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, one as an outside defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't make much effort," says Coles about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a superplayer.
Our vote voted no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles played Fangen, the defense quarterback took Kurt Warner apart.
Defender Darrelle Revis caught an accident and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points the jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets, answered "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answers both, because the jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without a single one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Rested Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some think he is the best long-distance runner of all time after he broke his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to make the 42.2 km track in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the win on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least one world championship title or set a world record on every track from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, for fear, which was perhaps exaggerated in retrospect, that air pollution could worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya switched to long distance, the record time for marathon has fallen by more than 2 minutes in the last 10 years, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had spasms in his calf two weeks ago and could not train for a week.
Apparently, after a break, he came back refreshed and not rusted.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great."
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - for over orchestrating his races, avoiding many world's best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders, as if this were a track race, and setting world records over the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassie as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the route in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers had dropped.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last appearance to separate from Kwambai, who came second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi was third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time at 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 is held by Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as a back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She planned her run skillfully by letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners ride out first, but after 30 kilometers over.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the hardships in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the growth of theme parks around Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, noisy and gigantic hustle and bustle, lies a quiet city where the pride and complications of African American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet the city that she describes – and that made her a tourist destination by taking her to the Florida travel guide, which was produced by the federal writer project at the time of the depression – is and remains in many ways a very special place.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidacy, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation on racial relations, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, a resident of the city from birth and a member of the congregation of the city's oldest church.
It must be true."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is on the one hand a stronghold of literature and on the other hand an example of the black culture - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on guard.
And the concerns about Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the locations of black history and human drama.
Naughty as Oskar both in real life and in literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Beyond the street to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always takes care of, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and whatever--always fits to hour rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty, full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
Hurtson is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came to the city roaring, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing trousers, in a city that even today imagines something about her venerable style of clothing.
According to Mr Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while rocking in his chair, on a back terrace looking at Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous writer, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no great memorial, no public readings on a large scale.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's slow two-lane main street.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950 ’ s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys often came and threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting away," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even once a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the request of the Supreme Court to force integration by calling its decision against the school council in the Brown case "infringing rather than respecting my race".
Residents today say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - hugging his teacher in the morning and hugging his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri , daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"One did not embrace his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural gap," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, civil rights have helped create room for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors, and artists who overcame prejudice, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker set out for Hurston's nameless tomb and began fighting for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much-praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found on the bookshelves and made them again part of the American literary canon.
The highway project came exactly at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in public light.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbor saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-lane highway revived the city, speeded it up at top speed, and aroused real civil pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd expressed it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
More and more people arrived, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-story library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from Orlando city centre can it sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It's 90% black these days.)
Outsiders looking for the history of Eatonville and its meaning are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, permission is required in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men in the field work - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew, an elevated degree of home pride was born.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her whole race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed up like any other race and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or the police, who could use some help according to him.
And even the younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just pass through here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon the other day on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at your story for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York they speak fluently financial Latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from the newsstands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that above their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with glass facades, bankers and hedgefond administrators who have the monopoly in New York, daily have the worst horror working day since the 1929 stock market crash.
The suppliers still push the metal teaweeds along sidewalks with loud rattles and transport trays loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still roam around between apartments like human pack animals loaded with around 50 ironed T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like pole on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting on their breakfast bagels on the sidewalks and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 pm and 7 pm.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon I decided to open a new savings account due to all the doomsday talk.
Although I had decided to put my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, about 20 people were already standing in line.
Not at the cash desks to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists about the way to Macy's department store, and where new customers open accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, so I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank clerk with a license," stood in line for the same reason I did.
Unlike me, however, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called Thrifts (a little like a building savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state, saying that they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silently and quietly bankrupt.
Over the past few days, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion bank, has gone into bankruptcy administration, and last Friday when New Yorkers went home for the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank that owns $440 billion in savings, looking for a saving buyer.
Fearing another collapse, the office and shop staff standing in front of me brought their cash to a bank considered a safe haven, a bank responsible for most of the bailouts on Wall Street.
In recent weeks, ordinary New Yorkers have acquired a flowing financial Latin.
A woman who was on the phone in my Chinese parent supermarket referred with so much familiarity to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank and its emaciated-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if she were blaspheming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block has dropped from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going into a risk."
Muslem graves desecrated during legal slip in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing member of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belief, will take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008 to represent the organisation "Cities Against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed out with a red line.
The police accused right-wing extremists of desecrating the grave in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, where extreme right-wing parties were making considerable profits in the parliamentary election of the country on the same weekend.
On the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an action organized according to the police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Stern on some of the graves, but detectives consider this to be an attempt to conceal the motive of extremists driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman of the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" about the news of the grave desecration that took place when the religious month of Muslim Ramadan is coming to an end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is underway in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, which received almost 30% of the votes from both far-right parties, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law in their election campaign and some of their electoral slogans were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, campaigned for a ban on headscarves and burkas and even expressed his dislike of food, which is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, indicating that the extreme right is the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The Kent police were granted the right to impose a foreign travel ban last Thursday after submitting to the judges evidence of Glitter's criminal record of child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
Speaker of the Court reported: "On Thursday, 25 September, the Kent Police requested permission from the Ashford District Court to prevent Mr. Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the sex offenders register, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a prison sentence of 5 years.
Kent police said she wouldn't discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokesperson for Kent's police unit said, "The Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country and abroad."
"We believe it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the primary concern of the Kent police to protect Kent's inhabitants and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that may exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse to 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport control and he flew to Hong Kong after a few things.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Great Britain.
Last but not least, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22nd and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to request that he register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
'I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who renounce concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into these moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find gesture typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen look or expressiveness of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents varied theatricals of some productions on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the month of flamenco photography, 'reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that 'flamenco-people' can be any human being, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
Quite normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character is in her heart.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera'.
Inspired by the 'Cante de las Minas' festival, Bauer made a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that remind of classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image modernity and the idea, as Bauer Flamenco understands: 'Music with traditional roots, which changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, being, was and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Famous figures in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the narrow selection of almost seventy artists who were photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as 'portrait of the veterans of sports' ('SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer too `I like to photograph the people, to get to know them and to put me in their state of life, be it for a short moment or a long time.
I think that in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or meet people, personalities you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of portraits of flamenco today, entitled 'Flamenco-people', is on display in the gallery of El Fotómata, located in the street called la calle de la Mata, parallel to the street of la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the Roma he's just writing is 'a foolhardy'.
He does not yet know where the plot of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project he's dealing with is 'a foolhardiness' and 'everything points out that he doesn't have to write the novel'.
'If I were prudent, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to finish the novel at some point', so he concluded his participation in the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he has seen hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival's premium and who most of those present give their voice, is compared to the old edition of 'Our Mutual Friend' and can be seen in the theatre Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in front of him, who realized that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature arose, which wants to experience from 'extraordinary adventure', from 'joy at reading' and from 'more than before'; how he writes and preserves 'discipline' to complement 'the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentaries, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what 'memory images' it is that form the basis for his stories.
The Hispanic novelist admitted that there is 'no way' to measure what and how to know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience', Vargas Llosa stressed, who claims that it causes 'effects' and 'brings people even more apart', so I asked the writers 'not to leave themselves to lightness' and 'take responsibility' for his vocation.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play along: Bullfighting parties were partly cancelled.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, with which the festival in Pozoblanco was to be concluded, was moved to yesterday morning.
With the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organiser decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the festival was exposed to unstable weather, so two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, so the second bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after whom he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his bullfighting skills.
And even worse was El July, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, most of the audience reacted in his second fight with Buh-Rufen.
In Álava, two people wanted to avoid the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes to ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the city of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers called on the drivers of the car to stop, and they fled.
It looked like they wouldn't have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police followed her and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as reported by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and falsification of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the Álava Region Transport Police had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to avoid the control.
The police started the persecution until the car stopped at the edge of the road after a few kilometers. At that moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee to a forest area via a country road.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally caught up with one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug traffickers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to the exact laboratory analysis and weighing the bundles to other police stations.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate was `doubled', so that it did not match the license plate indicated in the car papers, which is why there was also an arrest for falsification of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who, as mentioned above, managed to escape, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
28-year-old A. A. J., who was arrested, was taken to a police station for questioning.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, who is known for the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
A witness observed how she tried to get out of her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, spokesmen of the California traffic police reported to the magazine 'People'.
The witness explained in detail that Locklear `pushed through the accelerator after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and as she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses several times'.
A little later, the Witness, who at first had probably not recognized the actress, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby street and getting out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she was 'afraid of Locklars'.
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, standing across the street blocking traffic.
'She seemed disoriented,' so the police took her to a special drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed herself cooperative, excessive drinking was excluded from the first moment. 'The first observations of the officials to follow, we believe, that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,' says the speaker.
Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving under the influence of an indeterminate substance that could not be determined and taken to a local detention centre at around 7:00 p.m.
Two months ago Locklaer was released from the Arizona hospital after treatment, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Federation of the United Left be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and member of the United Left, has today assured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one who will take the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sports in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take over the responsibility for this', Llamazares pointed out what action the party must take against him, who is still a city councillor on the municipal council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the necessity of 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the rule violations that Silva might have begun: 'The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency'.
With regard to this topic, he stressed that the formation has 'a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
`Sangre de mayo': Heldenbuch von Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros investment for filming.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to 'present a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of actors.
`Sangre de mayo', with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and later shown on Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós' literature, assures us that thanks to this filming his 'childhood dream' came true. He owes this to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the autonomous community of Madrid to make a memorial film for the second century celebration in Madrid on 2 November. Especially because the story is based on 'Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the commission.
The total contribution of 15 million made for filming by the autonomous community of Madrid, Garci, as he added, offers the 'one-time opportunity' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the image of 'confused Spain, who chose the wrong leader for the struggle, because the people had been brought to a standstill by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII'.
However, the Cineast regrets that the financing could not be expected as in `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as in `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script could not be shot with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost all his career.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in `Volver a empezar', was involved in his usual way of working: he stood on stage with the actors, with whom you first have to rehearse before you start shooting and for those who did not cast, he appeared `humiliating' and giving respect, `a part of the profession of film director is to provide help in theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you work.'
Many actors he encounters in `Sangre de mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), believes that none of the three candidates who represent Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo' nor `Siete mesas de billar francés' nor, finally, the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect awards for this film.
'In the beginning you think you're working for the offspring, later you realize that it's just for flourishing, and now you're happy when you've produced another movie,' says Garci after more than 30 years of working.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville adores a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert for oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and campaigned for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
Isabel Bayón was fascinated by the life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the period between the wars.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
'We are not trying to tell about her life, but to preserve her Esprit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
For example, 'The Dance of the Butterfly' seemed to me like Guajira, or 'The Dance of the Snake' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing was also in this aesthetic area,' she claims.
The production anticipates two extraordinary collaborations: Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in 'La puerto abierta'; and Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work together with one of her ex-students.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I am very honoured.'
The production also includes musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with actor Juanfra Júarez, he 'takes over the role of companion of the artists who were divas, in whom he falls in love again and again.'
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a particular era and whose works no one knows about today and therefore she is even less appreciated," says Bayón.
The performance takes place today at 20:30 in the theatre Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture, to celebrate the `Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008), with the aim of remembering the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of the two.
Thus `the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is concluded with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the home museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the travelling exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May and after which it was in various places in Andalusia, now reached New York and is presented during the course of the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and work of the Andalusian poet more famous.
The U.S. Can't Imagine Without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in `Sensation Reporter', and from the then prevailing performance of the American cinema, which was abandoned, from the whole of America to Newman with his inspiring performance came and followed her.
Look what it cost her to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Still, that was a big blow for everyone.
'What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,' said Robert Redford weeping, 'my life and my country were the greatest drowsiness of his life.'
No one was afraid neither to make a fool of themselves nor to exaggerate.
As the 'father' of cinema and the fatherland, he died at a sad moment when there is fear of terrorists and market collapse, in which the depressed self-esteem of the Americans is on the hopeless quest for reasons to regain dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people you can admire remain, you do not necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official enemy of Richard Nixon and, like various losses, suffered both profits: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and founded in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift to the country where it took him a lot of effort to assert itself against a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of astonishment beats to take home high above Hollywood regardless of nationality and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
'The greatest of us all has left us,' confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to try to live like Paul Newman lived: to maintain high standards of righteousness, to lead a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced one time and was married fifty years later to Joanne Woodward, whom he was faithful to, although there were certainly many ways not to be.
"Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?" he often joked himself.
In heaven he will be proud that his daughters have the same opinion on earth as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, he was not as proud as he was of the faithful spouse, of the loving father, of the attentive grandpa and of the philanthropist,' they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are poor.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder: 'Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
It was called the perfect street, and according to my assessment, it was the worst street with everything around it and on it.
Of course, that's a lot of nonsense, if you took into account the evaluation and I could check it, it would clearly have been impossible to get through.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pick-up that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they let you proceed, they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the traffic jams on the road).
So don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of going there only because of it) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only available in the size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
All right, things like this are a little bit compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
The waiting has taken more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it was once possible, but it would be more difficult to get them back.
It also looked like a 40 - minute wait for rain, which led to the temptation to organize a popular uprising and raid the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time for the classification because of this chip that I got, I can already imagine that the exit has been incorrectly stamped.
Of course, if I were asked for a perfect road, I would never think of this road.
So I think we're going to dream about a city that's well prepared for the Olympic Games for a long time to come.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which, however, is capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move on the campus of the company).The system observes what it hears during entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this 'receptionist' can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also place those present in the groups after the discussions.
In the presentation video, `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group that is talking to her, and that no company employee is.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week they talked very superficially about the strategy change of Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have as many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary things, instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft added one or another feature and extras in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worthwhile
The Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, that was part of the theory that it was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Many wisely pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you have to think of your 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system each time, but more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the 'windows' environment.
What does half of existing applications in the computer serve for?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
The interest of Microsofts is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, no doubt.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the soft drink machine: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints out a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google, used for web searches.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not be released at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark at the same time.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
Android and iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand on in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to the clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we begin to list the countless stars performances, we can go back to the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard that had raised heavy weights in a travelling circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
The English-speaking people call it 'tank'. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called `Marcel' in the narrow circle. Legend tells that the name is associated with sport and comes from boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' dominates all because of its outstanding cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) which has these T-shirts as detail on the neckline.
And note, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of 'tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxers retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton trousers, t-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's a shame to use them as undergarments.
You're very charming.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is petite, but full of joie de vivre.
At present the siblings Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved there her residence and also makes the presentation of the most important premiums in fashion that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season that my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I have also attended the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and participated in the dinner in Valentino's honor.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s, where we find many ideas.
I like to go through a city and watch women dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do that a lot.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but finally, everything is in one place, and these areas have many similarities.
Ever since I was a kid, I've been thrilled with the clothes; I've always wanted to go to my grandmother's toiling around in my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a theme park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothing.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and rehearsals to look into the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself into the real acting role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
Recently you turned 30, haven't you fallen into a crisis?
Oh, come on.
I feel better than ever, when I'm thirty years old, I feel good.
I think the woman is getting mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological watch.
I've done the things I've wanted to do since I was little, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you think about becoming a mother, don't you?
For a long time I have known that I am going to be a mother, because that is what my body demands, and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I will give my child great happiness and raise it with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works you took part in and which were shot last year.
That's the way it is and I really want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much hope that 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A couple of days ago, you showed up on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
All right, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, has just called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show. I know that two garments from our collection for Mango have been auctioned to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
I, as the one who knows her, would tell you they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous cause, but when she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
The drivers, who can relapse because of the alcohol level, will have to install the `Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for the alcohol level, installs this system in his car, which forbids him to start the car in a drunken state. If he is alcoholic, then the car does not start.
The initiative was already announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General’s Office. According to her, this is a pilot project that will last for one year.
The purpose is to resocialise the driver, which is why he gets a course for the re-education of traffic behaviour.
In addition to the Prosecutor General's Office, as experience has shown, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75 % of drivers who were reported more than once for driving under the influence of alcohol were again driving.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents auto-start when the driver has made alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is determined which is higher than allowed.
It costs more than EUR 1 000, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of standard violations in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, 115 lives are expected to be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legislative reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still in the Spanish markets, in no store available, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., at the time scheduled by the program, next to the presidential hangar of the airport Benito Juárez de México DF landed the plane of the Spanish Air Force, with which Prince and Princess of Asturias traveled.
The sun went down, but her rays still forced her to use her hand as a parasol to see the royal couple getting off the plane.
Directly on the gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so, you can't take people at the airport at this time of day.
No, she's the Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, so, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and know the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including military protection of 27 naval soldiers who give honour.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair blown by the wind, without ordinary `peep-toes', perhaps she was told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official entourage is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for her, who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium fashion and there was probably no significantly outstanding fashion designer and bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Awards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a cash prize of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, yesterday saw her drawings in the Mango store window on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest business is located in London.
So many events have happened that are connected with the fact that you want to thank fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by the pain because his brother died recently, pulls himself together. He put on the suit from the fashion house and put on some jewelry from ELAH that was breathtaking. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango house, greeted the guests and was such a cavalry, so that he ended up with the Baron von Rotschild without a jacket, because jackets they lent to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, hastened to the store and had a pair of trousers and a shirt that she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet rehearsals, so she got into excitement, remembered the old times, grabbed a pole and made a kind of 'grand plume'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace's premises, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on her cell phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a person who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, la la, that's life.
1001 Council against stress
There is not 1000, but one more way to forget chaotic everyday life.
And even if there are few, they are all gathered in a book that says how to relax. The book comes to the bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and the problems of shutting down from the world of work.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the whole list of possibilities that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called `1001 possibilities to relax' and so the peace the book conveys comes to the bookshops of the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If you think that it is impossible to reach peace in the areas such as work with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered, how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes proposed, which lead to relaxation.
When the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, switch off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children talk at night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be frightened, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (once in a lifetime, for example, during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child cannot remember anything.
There is no single reason to cause this phenomenon.
Connections with other manifestations in sleep are often sought, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, enuresis noctura (bed-wetting at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we mentioned earlier, it may be due to very high fiber, stress situations or overburden.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency at which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one speaks calmly in individual words, whispers or it can be quite the opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended that the child be observed and consulted with a specialist in order to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and thus arises.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, be it, it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to excite the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are terrible and a little too wild.
For the nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation methods can be used to help them to get some inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
When speaking occurs in sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember, it's harmless to the child, and the next day it won't remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of your sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, when it becomes frightened after a couple of appearances, it is recommended to consult or find out what reason the child has for fear.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to conduct an interrogation and get more information.
So you won't be able to do anything with it, because when the child sleeps, it's unconscious and can't think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams of and why it says that, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, don't tell the kid that you hear that at night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, this is a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhouses ... finally
After a long stretch of thirst, Illhäuser is finally back on the field on a successful course.
Without much effort, the yellow-blacks scored numerous goals and managed to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The speed of this encounter, at which the attackers had trouble to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose long distance shot passed just past the corner, Illhäuser was to dominate the game with ease, and it succeeded in alternately first Fonderflick with a long distance shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot tip to challenge Denmark's defense.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and only let through the lively Riahi at the head of the storm.
The start of the second half was to be decisive with first two goals won by Riahi and Temporale, and right after that with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, who was just right to accept a ball that had been fought off by Diebold in a first attempt.
However, the Ill-Housian goal scorer should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and should be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, which meant that his teammates had to continue to play out numerically.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and did not face any major problems to an Illhaeusian elf, which withdrew only a little to 'compress' their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen, who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to arrive at the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he will come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, which was founded by the Breton fishermen to enforce measures in view of the extreme increase in the diesel price, which has reached a record value of on average more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the press spokesman of the Elysée Palace David Martinon `the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies to become competitive again, and to ensure the working conditions and the payment of seafarers'.
Sarkozy is eagerly awaited by the fishermen.
Tuesday morning, they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, causing congestion of nearly ten kilometers in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break off.
The Quiberon peninsula was delimited by a barrier.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets from early morning before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the major total refinery in Donges in the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting to take place at the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec has to decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee who did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue', for 'the fishermen will not yield at any point' and 'do not want to go to Paris', for example announced Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from 'Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 from the consequences of cancer at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes said goodbye to the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its 2008 delivery forecast
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the impending recession, to be a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast of 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider surrendering more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times’ Sunday issue, the American International Group, which was financially supported by the U.S. monetary authority, is considering handing over more than 15% of its assets to pay back the $85 billion that was ahead of it.
AIG is willing to drive the sale of a large part of its business beyond its international life insurance and pension plans in the United States.
According to the FT, the AIG Board of Directors met Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation was obtained at the AIG.
FT further explains that assets from which AIG might separate include its International Lease Financial Corp. aircraft leasing branch, its 59% stake in the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, FT continues.
AIG must make the sales as quickly as possible in order to repay the loans of more than 85 billion granted by the Federal Reserve, including the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of their capital and that the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris meeting Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic case of prices on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to rescue the banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has dropped by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As for the points, the strongest fall in his history (684.81 points) had been recorded earlier on September 17, 2001, the day of the decline in trade following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
According to the final launch figures, the Nasdag index, mainly for technology, has dropped by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widespread Standard&Poors 500 index has fallen by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan by the Chamber of Deputies, which was to restore some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which was already hit at the beginning of the quarter.
By 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the MPs refused the financial secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
`Here a bad picture is put into circulation that presents Congress as unable to accept a plan,' said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market counted on this plan,' she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will be 'too late'.
'If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will soon be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, editor's note) and other central banks to deal with the crisis, which would limit credit conditions even more', warned Brian Bethune, head of the economy at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed that she emphasized the feeling of extreme urgency, 'that every day that passes brings with it the ruin of a financial enterprise' in the United States.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to buy out Wachovia's banking operations by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures for banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing 'not just an American crisis but a global crisis', added the analyst of the FTN Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The revenues of the state treasury within ten years fell Friday evening from 3.632% to 3.827%, and revenues within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner after points in first television duel
The first debate between the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another one to find out who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television duel for the election of both Republicans and Democrats, which was to be pursued by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite handsome, was not brilliant enough to allow him to stop his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday, according to which Obama is ahead with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat clearly makes the better figure.
Obama was the winner of the polls with 39% of the voters still indecisive, i.e. those to whom it is now important, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected from his competitor Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin,
'It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts,' but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
McCain, a seventy-year-old, did not stop putting his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy to the fore, clearly underlining his opponent's 'naïvety' with regard to these issues, which were at the centre of this first television duel.
'Senator Obama does not seem to understand that...' he stressed several times.
'I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to become president,' he also assured.
It's an attack that's been being preached in the Republican election commercials since yesterday.
Obama himself emphasized that he represents the future.
He spoke briefly and precisely, without getting out of hand.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image the world has of the United States.
'McCain still hasn't understood, but Obama has already', this weekend a democratic electoral commercial opposed to the accusation that Republicans had not grasped the full extent of the crisis that is on the 'Americans off the streets'.
'During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama yesterday denounced 20,000 people who had gathered in pouring rain at an election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'middle class' or 'worker'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, whom the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy even on the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
'The coming week could be a decisive turning point,' estimated the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's 'good economic instincts' to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is 'the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After stressing again that he might even be able to lower taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois Senator pointed out that the creation of a possible country's energy independence and the promotion of renewable energies, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, were his top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant consisting of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates cautiously avoided the issues raised by the plan to save the financial market of over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
'Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?'
Young people and oppositionists demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closure of the polling stations in the Minsk Market Square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator shall resign'.
Some admit that they didn't vote at all: 'What good is it if they do what they want with my voice anyway,' says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best possible light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the failure to issue visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the imposition of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, it wasn't them.
"We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the census," regretted Yuri Potemkin, press spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous union of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasises Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us it is the executive.
If Members of the opposition move into parliament, it is because they have been appointed and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean television broadcasting time, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because 'the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, gets into a crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.'
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, does not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that the turnout figures seem too high and that the extension of voting in advance (26% of the voters of Minsk) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
'Have you noticed that an election has taken place?, asks the leader of the social democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most likely to be in line with the Government's ideas.
The silence of the night descends again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate each other on their success.
Conversation - From blood that was restored to safety
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its President, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be happy, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
Above all, it has regained the confidence of the public, which was severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
It is well known that during the 1980 ’ s, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross’s blood donation service were contaminated with HIV and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and public dissatisfaction, in February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever with the aim of bringing light to the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and drawing up guidelines to prevent another disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to submit his report, several provinces then set up a committee to develop a new system for managing canned blood in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
According to reports by Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company, to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
`In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started her work, hardly 38% of people had confidence in the blood canning system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood cans and through the work in this field over the following years, we have regained public confidence,' she says, before she proudly stresses that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the population of Quebec now had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, is aware that 'trust is extremely fragile'.
Since its foundation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting on the principle of caution.
At that time, we witnessed the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been in charge since its inception in 1998.
And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we referred to one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which states that exclusion measures are applied if one does not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was received from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease was transmitted through the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied has a real meaning.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which allow the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in the donor's blood, and not that of the antibodies to the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation period between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, explains the specialist.
This time could be reduced to less than one week.
Thus, the risk of certain donors being infected without knowing it, and not being able to recognise it, has been significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one out of 12 million people are in danger of receiving HIV-infected blood.
In other words, it means that you would have to distribute 12 million blood cans before someone was infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cans each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV being transmitted via a blood can.
I believe that you can feel comfortable these days when you get a blood transfusion or prescribe it to restore your health,' says the director of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Only last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted through the blood by insects.
We need to monitor continuously,' Dr. Décary continues, before she stresses that Hema-Quebec must provide adequate supplies in addition to a secure supply.
'The need is increasing because the population is aging.
Since anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which on average accounts for only 3% of Quebec's blood donor population.'
Any healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who provide their blood are not accepted because, for example, they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is common are excluded from blood donation for one year.
`With these 3% we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can't donate blood.
It's hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep them and make them become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find the time to spend an hour in blood donation,' Francine Décary regrets.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec not only supplies blood, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used in severe fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being temporarily stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, formerly considered a biomedical waste, stem cells contain rich blood that can be used to treat severe diseases such as leukaemia.
'A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to take more than a thousand annually.
'We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year', explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of umbilical cord blood loss as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all of Quebec's hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semifinals
Montreal's Impact yesterday qualified for the semi-final round of the first league of the USL, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders in the second and decided to play the quarter finals in the Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal ratio counted.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the ninetieth minute of the match.
After a first half without a goal for both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other goals for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let us remember that in the first game of the pre-and-return series on Friday Impact brought a 2 to 1 defeat to the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle.
In the semi-finals, Impact will compete with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to balance a 3 to 1 deficit by a 4 to 3 victory in the back match in Minnesota, but the Whitecaps nevertheless moved into the semifinals with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be determined today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The Canadian team's number one trio is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn pushed forward the attack on the Panthers from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev transformed a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore, into six preparation games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of the whole shooting.
'I am not ready yet, warned the Russian.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.
`He was too attached to it in the first half, Guy Carbonneau noted.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause.'
Charest relies on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general assembly of the liberal party ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today's sub-election.
'Move the course of our last great border in the North': this is the long-term goal Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three giant screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric power plants, mines, viewed from Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large resources as during the parliamentary term.
To the press, the Prime Minister refused, by the way, to rule out that he would hold the elections this autumn, even if he said that his schedule was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' which the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area' which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches in recent times, the opening of the North - the northern area at 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North is 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not mention any date, investment sums or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At the most, some prospects for what could be more worked on: above all, water energy, the forest, but especially the mining sector, is fostered by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr Charests, the north has 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This 'area twice as large as France' 'is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only near us, it is within us', he stressed, as to show clearly that he is seeking to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown greatly due to its connection with the North, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
'It's ours, it's our future,' he added, after he had taken a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always called for, the Prime Minister told the press.
'This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, when the opportunity arises, I will take this position again on behalf of the government,' he explained.
In addition, 'with climate change we have to rethink our vision of the North', he explained and talked about the Northwest Passage, which will be accessible all year round due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member of Ungava's pecism) have already started discussions with some thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) occupies an important place, has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity where 'one will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will also be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
Plan Nord will be 'spoken, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as if it were a continuation of those liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
'Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have rethought to turn the challenges into new growth and development chanches.
This was, by the way, one of the themes of the weekend that was repeatedly raised, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's takeover of the party leadership.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the Beauharnois power plant to Adélard-Godbout dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future," said Jean Charest.
To the press, he referred to another, this time conservative, project, namely the 'Roads to the North' programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr Charest stressed that it was planned to be put into operation in 2012.
'This remains between us, but I intend to be there,' he confided to his party members, which resulted in those seizure storms.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible for him by law.
However, he stresses that his schedule is full, mainly because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The general assembly of the weekend provided the liberal party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, mainly from 'constitutional objectives', which were readily adopted: the PLQ particularly calls for the recognition of the 'characterity of Quebec' in the constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition adopted the guidelines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The leader of Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has re-launched the policy for the development of the Nord-du-Quebec, introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, when the liberal government came to power in 2003, the liberal government refused to apply it.
If she had done so, 'we would have gone much further today', Mrs Marois judged at the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed its support for the government's adoption of a plan for North.
"But what we want is that this is not just going to be a big idea," said party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who is coming back from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonored country
Mr. Vic Toews, former Justice Minister (whole irony) in Harper's cabinet, was the one who allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour last summer that she was a 'death' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged a never-ending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration for covering it with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that was the only one from all the countries concerned who did not bring home their compatriot, who was imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when things happened that were accused of him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier vegetate under inhuman conditions.
The only one who lets herself down to a judicial parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers in particular plead to bring Omar Khadr home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that closes its eyes to the torture: it is of little interest to them that, after so many years of agony, a young adult will certainly be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing here a insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly carries before him like a flag, and that sounds so nothing out of his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: one can arbitrarily abuse, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, quite as a leader, who is still only supported by the minority (may he be a minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they can find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this resolution, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-Director-General of the Canadian Barrick Gold Gold Mine.
This confirms, and pursues an orwellian logic, that the world's largest gold mining company sought a libel lawsuit of six million against three authors and a small destitute publishing house, with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of libel lawsuits, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to hold a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to express one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the trial ends, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defenses and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
By the way, the tactics in these unequal struggles are often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensual settlement that silences the other side and also deters anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast to what is common in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates are usually held in Canada through the exchange of ideas rather than by billets.
So it would have been enough if the Gold Mine had disclosed its books and files and opened up a real debate through which newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent audit teams could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes aside the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a hand move.
Could Mr Garver explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate and yet disregard the opinions of this very public?
It seems that this word in the Vice-President's world includes only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a rather cramped view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public, who supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada, does so mainly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not within a framework that many perceive as a gag complaint (in the course of the 'public debate' Barrick Gold has just addressed a demand to the authors of Noir Canada, in which it demands that they no longer use this term...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and truth-finding, which are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss issues that the rich companies of the world do not like, then who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead it by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment to which we belong has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate complaint clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she does not want a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit this type of unjustified lawsuit.
Rescue for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans get along
The Bush administration and senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis, which has been shaking Wall Street for months, still needs to be adopted by the two Congressional Chambers.
The main content is: better control by MEPs of the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public funds used, new dispositions to reduce the number of houses pledged due to arrears, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the executives of the supported companies.
American finance secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective,' said the Bush administration representative, Henry Paulson.
'Everything was done to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis on Wall Street,' declared the Democrat.
'This is the basic point: if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of the Americans will be enormous,' explained Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, for fear of the effect that a renewed failure would have had on the mood of investors.
The deadline that had been agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who took part in the negotiations late in the day, were more likely to support the agreement, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain dispositions to agree, especially those to allow owners to keep their homes, and those relating to the salaries of senior employees of state-saved businesses.
'If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain persons, that is nothing to which we could congratulate ourselves.
But these measures are necessary', he explained on the American television channels.
When asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: 'I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The guiding principles that I have read [show] that this is one thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,' he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at using taxpayers' money
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble, which initially led to the collapse of risk-rich mortgage loans (subprime) before extending to other forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally resulted in a freeze of financial strength and ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican MPs who failed the first attempt at unification last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'poisonous' assets of societies are to be secured in distress only by the government and not bought, one believes to escape the dead end.
To round off the perspective for all in Congress, one has also added an order stating that if the government makes losses with this program within five years, it can then levy new taxes in order to get back its invested capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be passed by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington will receive shares in the supported companies, which will pay dividends in the event of profits, and will be able to sell it again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the option of halting the attachment procedures relating to the dwellings linked to the real estate loans covered by this plan and of setting deadlines for repayment and severance payments paid to the senior employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on him today, and the Senate to vote on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, there were other voices yesterday against this plan, both on the part of the Republicans and the Democrats.
'Of course, Washington doesn't understand us,' declared Republican Scott Garett, member of the Chamber's Finance Commission, to his voters.
Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one who is asking taxpayers to pay for it.'
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, head of a congressional group called 'the skeptics' caucus', presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to tell us: we ask Congress not to be pressured, and to consider carefully what path to take," he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe were once again shown that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, which is in great difficulty since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) in the crisis due to risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, declared yesterday the Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos.
To compensate, we have a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are coming.'
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was just about to nationalize another bank that was troubled by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all ongoing loans from Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion ($75,5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the UK bank's branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to be nationalized by the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis after Northern Rock.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was his trump for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Had the American actor freed himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably also kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters into the world.
But what a great endurance runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 due to lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was a kind of rival on the screen for a long time, more careful in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but just as an apostle of freedom and the blasting of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots one of the glorious faces of the American dream should emerge.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
Because it reflected an entire country that was in love with the self-made man, the fighter who was injured in battle in the Pacific War, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success at the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver, who finished second in the 1979 24-hour race at Mans, and also a sex symbol, although he had lived in a flagship relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed and overly sensitive star to the glamour of the show business disappear, whose mystery one will never solve completely.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death put cinema lovers in Taumel this weekend, while all his great roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change is passing with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes back to mind, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Die Katze on the hot tin roof filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
There is a much shorter memory (1990) evoked by his sensitive Mr Bridge, who, at his old age, is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all her promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A Handful of Dirt) by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, who was re-recorded after his death and who made Newman well known in 1956.
This likeable gonove in the outstanding The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
That face through time, that was him.
Still him.
His résumé unites epochs.
He is best known as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team, from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977).
His fans found him in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers in 1994.
In 2003, Sam Mendes' last role as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition was completed.
In contrast to several film legends who have withdrawn from the film world early enough, Newman was to stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his pomp and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to 'underplaying' when he judged his overly expressive achievements.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flew for a long time.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholics, villains or desperate ones, with whose perfect representation he reflected his slipping and rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the Canadian Margaret Laurence's novel) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the leading role, drew a subtle portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott due to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
At the flood of honors that poured yesterday on Newman, his close friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (who had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared extremely apprehensive: 'His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generousness and joie de vivre were essential qualities of the deceased actor.
Aside from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood's drifting away, is now also going away.
We have often seen him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and considered this to be quite tasteless, although we found it funny at the beginning.
Nevertheless, the profits from his sales flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman was engaged to the point of shooting.
He left a letter with these sentences to his five daughters: 'Always and until the very end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.'
And for us it was an honor to be allowed to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and widest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Hammer &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, negotiations will begin in the criminal proceedings against Jáno's contract and his accomplices.
In particular, the defendants are accused of participating in organised crime, grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts, including forgery of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the funds recovered from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often falsified invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are said to have partly been invested in the funds of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal, partly in the private funds of individuals.
As the investigation authorities announced, fictitious invoices were presented when the tender funds were received, and the associations were not supposed to have complied with their obligations.
According to the indictment, a large part of the bills were falsified.
The invoice blocks were bought on the market of Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue invoices was decided on the round trip north of Lake Balaton, to which István Lados of Jáno's contract was sent.
In the course of this "exploratory tour" Lados should locate pensions and restaurants.
He asked for bills about the consumptions, in order to be able to later issue invoices based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest.
The majority of these accounts are said to have been manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice András Ri, who according to our information was responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "exploratory tour" was a beer pub.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by Hammer and Co in 2003, the catering company is said to have hosted the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the boss of the company says that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant at once.
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious flaws in form and content.
In a boarding house in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed according to the bill.
The imagination of the bill falsifiers was apparently just as limited when it came to the Pigal Kft., a catering company, in whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppa do not appear according to the prosecution.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas informed hvg.hu, it was immediately clear to him that they were fake documents when documents were presented to him by the prosecutor during a questioning.
"Our company name and tax number were wrongly affixed to the stamp."
And further: Apart from formal errors, the fact that the farm is said to have accommodated one hundred people after having a total of eleven rooms that are impossible to accommodate so many people was also wrong.
Also on the bill food was mentioned, the restaurant had not been in operation for a long time.
The falsifiers have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they targeted offers only travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary travel on the cash payment bill, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
As the investigation revealed, they also mentioned VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The total amount of VAT was wrong on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the company only charged 15 percent VAT instead of 25 percent, and the employees only issued machine invoices, but the forged documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made by the "accounters" was that in a case they had indicated "goods transport" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the firm specialized in investment advice, the prosecutor's office informed.
Further errors in form - incorrect invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as counterfeits.
Likewise, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing director stated that they had never issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" has been made by the counterfeiters at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this company was in liquidation at the time (2001), when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore stated that he did not issue the invoices himself.
Consciously faked
The other group of accountants are persons who were well aware that they had to make fictitious invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., which is also currently in liquidation, is also said to have worked with contract and co.: In 2003, the GmbH is said to have supplied the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with counterfeit invoices with a total value of HUF 5 million, which related to services not provided.
However, there were also no payments, since the invoices were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, but what the persons concerned forgot to mention in their documents.
The third group of accountants comprises persons directly associated with the accused.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a company based in Budapest, but not found there.
This company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components with a total value of HUF about 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, the Cash Investment Kft. in liquidation since 14 September 2005 from Kiskunhalas is said to have acted as buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigation, Kubatov was able to issue invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their own equivalent.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian masons at Iván Kubatov's express wish.
In fact, none of these companies were active, which according to the accused was due to lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's foundation documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices in the total value of HUF 14.2 million to the organizations on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The prosecutor's office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice amount and VAT.
Kubatov is even said to have abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for issuing fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were enclosed with the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but used these amounts for a different purpose.
To cover this up, they submitted five fictitious invoices to the TMA of the Works Team Kft.
By the way, these invoices were secured during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the course of the negotiations, some defendants are now expected to confess to the procedure of falsification of the bill, as already filed before the prosecutor's office.
A sensation could be in case the main defendant Jáno's bid for a comprehensive confession decides.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to report comprehensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have entered into a pact with him on the reparation of the bulk of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether the surcharge in return is willing to assume responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that Zusatz will now play the "offensive" after his requests had met deaf ears to alleviate the detention and house arrest.
While other criminals who have done far greater damage to economic crimes and have not remunerated them are at large, or at least under house arrest, this possibility is denied.
The psychology of overbidding - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the bargain bids.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to even pay excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was supposed to play lottery, while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were investigated by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain cortex, was measured among losers of the auction, in which the outbidding of the opponent plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of striatum.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group have also carried out investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should compete against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group were also promised 15 dollars in reward, in case they emerged as winners of the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was therefore only that the emphasis on one was on winning, while the other was on losing.
However, as proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the group playing "against losing" were prepared to make higher bets than those in the control or "win" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These have so far only justified the behaviour observed at auctions with the pleasure of winning or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological methods, so that we now have a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Business Faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should the doctor be consulted?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the generic term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - inflammation of the liver and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E, through the digestive tract (e.g. contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as semen, vaginal secretion or saliva).
Travellers are recommended vaccination against viruses A and B, against virus C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A are approximately two to three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes bright, the urine dark, and recovery can take up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die annually from hepatitis B-induced, far more severe diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in 10 people are infected with medication.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen destroys the liver cells insidiously - in many cases the first symptoms show up after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular checks, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who have undergone blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease can already be detected during a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the family doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognised in good time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby preventing the risk of infection and preventing the emergence of cancer.
30 September is the World Day of Hepatitis, held for the first time in 2004 by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to increase awareness of this chronic inflammation of the liver caused by viruses, their development and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
Recent research shows that religious faith acts like a kind of "pain," which is said to have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: it was investigated to what extent faith in God influences the feeling of pain in humans, reported the British paper "Telegraph".
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate most of the pain.
By means of a brain scan technology, it could even be demonstrated that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participate.
During the experiment, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand of the subjects, which gave off the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand a picture of the Mother of God painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would create a kind of religious trance while choosing da Vinci's image, because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt comforting.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and during this time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they were supposed to look at either the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that at the sight of the Mother of God they felt "in security," as if they were "concerned," and they felt "rest and peace."
During the viewing of the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo's work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the experiment, said that one could also produce similar effects with other strong-acting images also with the atheists, one only had to find the corresponding photo.
"We would have to find a picture that triggers very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and in many cases it does," says Wright.
After these excellent results, only the question remains of what effect a Madonna painting of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On the occasion of its tenth birthday, Google can rightly claim that it is in people's pockets just as it is above their heads in the sky: it knows where people have spent their holidays, which doctors they are going to, and what moves them.
And still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
In the direction of skeptics plagued by Orwell's horror visions, he says: These would just overlook the essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, thus getting closer to the company's original goal of "organizing all the information in the world."
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changing work, Google was still only at the beginning of collecting information.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "Which job really suits me?", but software programs are not yet able to do so, as they don't know enough about the users.
Not all internet users are aware that the search terms will be registered in the course of their internet searches, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows visitors to save their own search history and later use it so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic is also based on the so-called "Recommendations" with which the system recommends tailor-made products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of data misuse - "If you look what I do" - some people are worried about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company that is frightening, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the rebellion against the power that many internet users reject.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of an incident, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was recently the action against paedophilia in Brazil, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also made it possible to identify the paedophilia.
However, users concerned about personal rights could still breathe in May, when Google and the civil rights organization EFF successfully took the FBI to justice: therefore, Google cannot be forced to release information to the FBI on a secret request with any point of the Constitution in the future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms by reference to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but the list of individual users, respectively their web and search terms list, was withheld retroactively to two months.)
So Google's image remains controversial: those who hate to release their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy through the use of Google services, scourge the company with the outrage due to the conservative companies.
However, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users united, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even though both are struggling for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that unlike Microsoft, Google does not require any identification codes for its users and makes its services available free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem to be far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks see through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet razor-sharp - a relationship that has become particularly central in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing else but collaboration, i.e. the users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show oneself publicly.
An average youth can manage his profile on multiple community portals at the same time - from Facebook via Xanga, can connect it to each other through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries that are geostified on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When looking at last night's party photos, the girlfriend will soon find out who her unfaithful friend was having fun with, or the employee will be fired because in his blog he is all too honest about his anger about the management of the company - one thing is certain: the term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Those who lead an online life are what they reveal - so one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even bypass the Google Monopoly, can do so with pleasure - such as Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine, but deliberately leaves no traces.
Not a few people deliberately do not register on community sites so that they cannot be found, but Google's online applications, such as word processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can also be handled with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
However, public opinion waits for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising space is threatening the revenues of advertising agencies, and the increasingly rapid introduction of services is causing worry not only to Microsoft but also to other software developers.
However, critical viewers also find the disturbing counter-poles: For example, the Executive Board rejected a protest by the employees completely after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, and management also thought that the multiple meals of the employees were too expensive. However, all this seems to be mild against Google even going down in 2006 before the Chinese government and agreeing to an agreement that all dissident hits, or those that violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The internal regulation of the Group is that no new service is advertised in advance, but only when it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could turn a lot around again: While some believe that Google's book and magazine scan or archiving project is now assuming that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are concerned about the system "Health", which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database already provides the next generation of sci-fi authors with the material - such as "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes a future in best Orwellian fashion, in which a person becomes frighteningly approachable thanks to Google-related data.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd to remove traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of helping to eliminate the traces, the spokesman of the Police Commissioner Borsod announced on Tuesday.
The young people were well-informed and are currently being charged with the aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, they are two girls who defend themselves at large.
Aid is threatened with imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion that he deliberately murdered several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a 53-year-old a larger amount of money.
However, the suspect did not want to pay off his debts, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor to a site in Ózd where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act by a long hand - this is also evidenced by the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the murder weapon as well as the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Provides Purchase Offer for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, has been offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange’s share packages.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by Poland despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell more than 60% of the shares in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily newspaper "E15", the offer of Poland includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
The newspaper reports that until now the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he also did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange to be 5-10 billion kroner.
According to shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investmentbank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In her comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers already spoke of "second September 11" on Tuesday.
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, said "La Repubblica" - the president had not even been able to put his own party behind him for the bill, which should bring some relief into the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11".
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
According to "El Mundo", the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the global economy is now on the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the Congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington will not have a political means of crisis management.
The world economy hangs in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example the Geneva "Tages-Anzeiger".
While some countries could still provide bailouts to their troubled financial institutions, they could save banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks go bankrupt, neither further financial injections nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU member states would have to leap over their shadow and centralise control of the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out to weak financial institutions, the Wiener "Der Standard" recalls. Moreover, the newspaper continues, the concerns are more and more realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers now also have to go a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is now sweeping the old continents like a tsunami.
Although the "savers" would not have to "weddle" with several hundred billion euros immediately, it would be advisable to record in which case it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayers' money in order to avert even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop new technologies for accident prevention, if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
Like the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented that inspired the Nissan engineers of Hummeln in creating new accident-avoiding systems.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic system controlled by car robots, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective shield," said Kazuhhiro Doi, Product Manager for Technology PR and Research Development, at the exhibition.
The compound eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
In order to imitate the function of the assembled eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
It identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision-avoiding process.
The obstacle is recorded in fractions of a second, and the car robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver is purely instinctive.
"If it weren't, the car robot wouldn't be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and Autorobot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are currently considered unavoidable.
The entire process must reflect the behaviour of the bees when they dodge other bees.
And this has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, the dodging can not be done up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and that only in the direction of the maneuverability of the tires.
While there are endless possibilities for the bees to avoid other bees, the researchers were only able to use rotational motion or acceleration and braking in the car robot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life span than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It doesn't have to save them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction based on previous maneuvers, so it constantly takes up just a handful of KB memory.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte-heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production as standard within the next ten years.
Another application could be the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately steering the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the finish line.
A name for the sinful child
Now there is the written version of the $700 billion rescue package law, which will be applied in several stages and aims to buy the banks' bad loans.
In the first run half of the money is to be spent.
At a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time East Coast, Congressmen came to an agreement on the $700 billion bailout package after several days of debate, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the US House of Representatives, saying that the only thing that needs to be done is to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain - supported the compromise reached on the rescue package.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said that the programme will have an impact and it will be efficient, but more needs to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about rescuing Wall Street, but about robbing the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening 8 a.m. (Central European time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a high-altitude flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives first votes on the draft law to stabilise the economy of 2008, then it is the turn of the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
The program, however, differs from the Bush administration's original recommendation that the $700 billion should be issued at once for the purchase of lazy, credit-burdened securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after the Congress is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum is to be spent on the purchase of credit-burdened, bad securities, and the president is to decide on the next 100 billion USD.
The programme will be reviewed by a separate Commission, to which the President of the Federal Reserve is also a member.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another Congressional decision.
In accordance with the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can at the same time buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-loaded securities, or other "poisonous" loans.
As responsible persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can take place both in an auction, as well as directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying means and companies pay the expected damages corresponding fees.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary resources in such a way that up to $700 billion can be made available as emergency aid to the American financial system, be it for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps to ensure that we are ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed, says Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can expect that their clearances, which are called "Golden Handshake" in overseas slang salopp, will be cut by the government.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The cut essentially means that if the ministry buys at an auction, the "Golden Handshake" will be taxed unless the retired banker is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of bad loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that managers' salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes the fact that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only relate to new agreements, so that the more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in managers' salaries are regulated by law, commented Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, on the measure.
The state gains equity in the participating banks, so that the risk to taxpayers is reduced, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank get better.
The bill requires the President to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect of us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, according to the Californian Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures were driven by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Like the Central Statistics Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007.
Export prices were 1.1 percent higher than in July 2008, and fell by 3.9% compared to the previous year.
Due to domestic and export price changes, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2 percent higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices rose only marginally compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
Also, the selling prices of the manufacturing industry increased only a little - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily for bags and belts - the increase was 4.6 percent, for shoes prices were 2.5 percent higher.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials drove the prices of chemicals and production significantly up (1.6 percent).
There was a decline in the price of crude oil (1.4 percent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), and wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices in paper production, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, price increases were measured between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the important domestic sales markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly as a result of the gas price increase introduced on 1 July.
Looking at the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry year-on-year, crude oil processing prices have risen most (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2 percent increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
A drop in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The rate of inflation in the other manufacturing industries ranged from 0.6 to 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent year-on-year.
On the domestic market, the highest price increase was recorded in the fixed assets sector in August (0.7%).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, while in the energy and processing sectors, they remained the same as in the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sectors (16.8 per cent) compared to the same period in 2007.
In consumer goods-producing sectors, prices rose by 6.8 percent, while in fixed goods, prices fell by 1.4 percent.
Industrial export prices measured in Forint rose by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a decrease of 3.9 percent year-on-year.
The domestic currency grew by 1.7 percent compared to the euro, by 7.1 percent to the dollar, and compared to the price of August 2007, it grew by 7.5 percent compared to the euro, and by 15.9 percent to the dollar.
No more visas to the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the American-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force on January 12, as the Foreign Minister explained to the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, "everything now depends on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced in time overseas."
However, she also stressed that there would be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now conducting negotiations in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" to the Republic of Hungary, and she also holds talks with Democratic advisors Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bailout for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support on Sunday for the $700 billion bailout package for banks, but there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
After day-long marathon consultations on Sunday morning, the Congress and representatives of the government announced that they had reached an agreement on the banking bailout package.
The crisis of Wall Street, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better suited than their respective opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to economic issues, while McCain's High, which gave him the presentation of Vice-President Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, has also melted.
At a campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly adopt the $700 billion package bill.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he supported.
"We must act now, responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened" - he said in front of 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to call McCain's economic visions "obsolete."
In an interview given to ABC, McCain explained: "We're all going to have a hard time doing this... but doing nothing is certainly not an alternative."
The Republican senator said that the plan also required the establishment of a control commission for the finance minister, as well as the restriction of handling for top managers - something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a definitive role in the negotiations, while Obama was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking region
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so "Der Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (mirror.de)
In the online edition of the left-leaning German news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution Destroys Their Fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over his positions.
The Christian-Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The break-up of the epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come to an end, but on Sunday something came to an end, which was already quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party
For ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, falling below the 50 percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. in the much-quoted Stoiber era.
The modernization carried out consistently by the CSU in the federal state has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but were appreciative at the pace. However, the secularization, the educational success, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain without effects on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation always goes hand in hand with the proliferation of options, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and more idiosyncratic.
It is striking that over the last few weeks, the traditional citizens' groups have expressed the greatest distance from the CSU: the liberal professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with high school diplomas as well as university degrees.
Here, the support of the CSU decreased to even less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports in its "Who with whom? Party leaders restrained in coalition issues" article on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in internal matters.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to commit themselves to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders hardly showed up in their cards.
SPÖ CEO Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership this is already the case.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the ÖVP as Vice Chancellor.
As he said, the voters voted out of the Schüssel-Molterer course.
A repetition of this direction would be out of the question.
Molterer, however, reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, when Faymann tried to interfere with the internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is going into opposition or coalition is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed internally by the ÖVP.
BZÖ CEO Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to assume government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun, which is being hosted by the EU Presidency, France.
In her speech to the plenary session, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MEP of the European People's Party, drew attention in particular to education segregation, as it is one of the most serious violations of the rights of Roma children, and this is also the greatest obstacle to their need for enforcement.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency of the Council, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and citizens' organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to Fidesz MEPs' press office, Járóka has pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in the search for jobs, Roma are being pushed out of the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth do not have secondary education and, thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can obtain a university degree".
Járóka also stressed that education was a fundamental human right, which would play a key role in asserting other human rights.
Investing in the early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU member states.
In the view of the honourable Members, it is important that these connections become as broad a circle as possible, i.e. Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma pupil starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; and by means of income and turnover taxes they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, the right to high-quality education must be guaranteed to the Roma - poor and segregated education must be stopped" said Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member said, a common, targeted and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the de-regulatory process in the education sector, with proper compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives being essential.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment, and give Roma children the democratic means to contribute to the future of Europe as a fully-fledged citizen," said Járóka.
Since last year's congress in Berlin, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the promotion of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European but also national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace for Time
The fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the election debacle, no heads are still rolling for the time being; at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates were postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their positions, the question is just how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17-percent loss of votes will be decided at the extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
But the much-chosen duo already let it see that it does not want to stick to their armchairs.
They want to soothe the angry faction and the party base, which demanded personal consequences one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was at his top of his career - the Christian-Social Union still reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
The CSU was a sole regulator in Bavaria for 46 years, accounting for 18 percent of German GDP.
The conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party's internal restructuring, the potential successor to Huber, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team that is conducting exploratory talks on a possible Munich coalition with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "Free Voter".
An irony of fate is that with the list "Free Voters" Gabriele Pauli gets into the legislature, whose anti-Stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein Duo first exploited, in order to then mercilessly dump the determined politician.
The CSU leadership is now concentrating all its forces on the stabilization of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings out of the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman called 28 September the "bittest day of his political career".
On Monday Huber made a few poisonous remarks towards the CDU - in his view the CSU would have deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a great deal to the success at national level in 2005, is not re-established with a joint effort, Merkel cannot become chancellor again after the parliamentary elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment with the fiasco, believes that the loss of territory of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
At 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result so far in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition made it to the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegality in counting votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
De Legislature of the 10 million resident state has been without opposition for decades. Nevertheless, before yesterday’s elections, the opposition, which was gathered under the name of “United Democratic Forces” (ODS), seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had already renewed his presidency mandate for the fourth time in 2006 in the course of the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional change, would “let” some members of the opposition in parliament this time.
That is why the ODS has even distanced itself from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly economically dependent on Russia due to rising prices of natural gas imports, and loans have even been made to alleviate price increases, and the country has also agreed to sell Beltransgas, the owner of the country's leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. In the background of the opposition's expectations, the hope was that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians had banned entry into the EU because of the anti-democratic political system.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections provided for a temporary relaxation, in which the emphasis was on positive movements rather than on shortcomings, such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD Rapid Report already criticised the campaign on Monday - so oppositionists should not be in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, for example, and Minsk is even willing to face smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny recognition of the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine is a federal state on paper, has considered the two territories as independent for one month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevich to our paper.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to let even one opposition figure into parliament".
The opposition does not plan any protest measures in view of the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to voters.
"We are struggling with many problems here - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the way of distribution, but yet I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones," said Milinkevich, alluding to the fact that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the establishment of social security.
"Thanks to the country's indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" reminiscent of the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," says Milinkevich.
In contrast to opposition politicians, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the deeds, not the words."The lack of opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast is served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are rotating doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
As of today, the measure will come into force against those clever people who first stamp and then drink coffee during working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers' Presidium.
">"Turnable doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services", said Minister Brunetta.
"Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta underlines once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the installation ends in all the buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary General said: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, there is now no breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the General Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
of Rome, the Minister announces that "within three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people per year are present at work".
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration.
According to the Minister, "their wage dynamics have been twice as large as the private sector over the past 8-10 years and well above the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have joined forces to counter the Brunetta Decree in the context of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the minister of the public service is showing figures of lower absenteeism at work - the consumer centre writes - the people of 'active lazy people' are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have joined forces to declare war on the illegal norms of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker during which verification visits can be made and further aspects of the Minister's innovations are being challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day 2500 accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain invalids for life.
For 2007, the Inail data (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were around 1200.
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will celebrate the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work in all the provinces of Italy in order to draw the attention of the social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention in the workplace is," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention at the workplace, to the protection of injured workers, to aid the families of victims and to raising public opinion".
"An outraged "basta" has risen to this point; understandable in the case of tragedies, which, in terms of scale, trigger some vortexes in the media and public participation. However, everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events, which can even be repeated in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is definitely also a resource problem: it has to be invested decisively in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness in school frameworks by young people who feed on the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to distract it from its social seriousness. We must put into effect and improve a legislative norm.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which insults the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decisive rules aimed at putting an end to the problem".
"Data from accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," emphasises Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's what the tragedy ultimately causes."
"We believe that one does not really do enough to counter the phenomenon of accidents. One can fight against it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate workers who already start at school."
"A further effort is needed - he added - in terms of communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that is a social emergency is required".
Mercandelli also referred to "the progressive deterioration of protection for the victims of accidents at work" and denounced the "abolition of the social system we have been fighting against in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the worker back a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations, which are decided from time to time by a legislator".
Mp3 player under charge: danger of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which, in a report published today in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Csrseri (scientific committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU.
"The report states in a note that 5-10 % of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for at least five years per week for more than one hour a day risk permanently losing their hearing."
"I am worried that such a large number of young people, who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume, will irretrievably damage their hearing without knowing it," says Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings – as the Eu states – show a clear risk that pushes for rapid action.
What really matters is to raise consumers' awareness and make this information public.
In the light of these scientific findings, we must re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"The scientists - the EU communication concludes - confirm that there is a legitimate concern and that the European Commission, together with the other Eu members and stakeholders, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music equipment and similar equipment".
There is already a European standard, which limits the level of noise from portable music equipment to 100 dB, and concerns about the damage that could result from excessive noise exposure.
One can very much limit this damage by resorting to solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of the noise exposure.
In its report, the scientific committee of the Eu points out that if users of portable music equipment listen to loud music only five hours a week (more than 89 decibels) so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace have already been exceeded.
Those who exceed this limit are risking the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This would therefore affect 5-10% of users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches the Commission for the Future of the Capital
We're starting today, it's supposed to be over in March, we're going to take stock in June.
This is the procedure laid down by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome, which met this morning in the new headquarters behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the leadership lines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the City Council and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Lord Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," says Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders will remain the City Council and the Municipal Council.
There is no reallocation of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a great project for Rome.
In March, their task will be completed and the Commission will be dissolved, as such a project must have a timed end point.
In June - as the Lord Mayor announced - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission".
Anyone who questions the Commission's competence, as its opinion lacks commitment, replies to Alemanno: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, like the Attali Commission in France, it delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time in mind, so that we can work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective".
The Lord Mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a penny and it will make us think about it. It will employ the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetically nor static in order to enable our city to make a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step into the future".
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, which "will not only be limited to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further", not only in terms of the role of Rome as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here’s a statement
A well-known American politician who is keen to be considered independent has written: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-american president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the U.S. economy through his decisions, and who maintained relations with hostile Islam (and still does so today as a private man).
The attacks against Obama are getting more and more violent, especially now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote in an internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he will be given the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!".
Actually, these attacks don't have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? And then there are also the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a big lead.
In this case, too, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the polling booth will we know who the real American patriot will vote for.
Here comes a mentality of the USA to the appearance, which was kept hidden up to the last.
"Say what you want, then we'll decide who we're going to make our creak, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you've never heard before – only now that the black candidate's success seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were questioned: What mistakes did Bush make during his term of office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains the weak point of Bush for the majority.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
The financial collapse leaves its mark on journalists as well: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many blame the Internet, the "murderer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really raise concerns about the general credibility of the information relating to the responsible parties.
They don't feel as alone as they used to be.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, there are the big problems caused by the cuts made by the newsroom, the space in which the editors work to assemble the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the journalists interviewed – if one wants to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism today fills the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the press believe that journalism at national level is on the wrong track.
In the local sector, executives are even 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction in which the web is going.
The most important publishing groups make their way into the Internet, which is regarded by many as the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to wanting to join the new technology in the hope that "they will bring something good for journalism".
The biggest crack in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level they share only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "security at work."
The managers who are afraid to lose their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
It's 30% for journalists.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "Redaktioner", editor's note) is always a topical topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, as it is the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and Internet operators, employers offer as they like it and so it becomes a question of take it or leave it.
The editors often get very high wages, but the editor can sometimes only get 10000 euros per month, along with pension and insurance money.
As far as vacation is concerned, the matter becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, in order to finally reach after a certain number of years 15 holiday days.
But, as they admit themselves, the American journalists often become "sick" during the year.
It's a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: JUDGMENT ON THE ROME: DANILO COPPOLA LEADS TO GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the second Trial Chamber of the Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the real estate agent's application, which had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is investigated against Coppola for Bankrot in the context of the counter-agreement investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a duty of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to move from the provincial town to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (against which the prosecutor's office had spoken out) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and to obtain evidence to accuse him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the $700 billion White House savings package: a large part of the Americans were and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's issue of the New York Times, which reports on how the crisis gradually divides the Republican party, which increasingly divides itself into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored state institutions and business community, and those neoconservatives that are hostile to "those in Washington" and the financial world, and, above all, wins voters in the south and the center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise mainly to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example just mentioned is, however, only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the US, but also throughout the West, and perhaps beyond, will be affected by it.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the long-awaited events that are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the outrageous renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close links with foreign countries and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the assets of private households that live in a single state.
This is an immediate political problem for governments: how to behave towards the families concerned, which are also a huge mass of voters.
The crisis therefore appears global economically, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have been sidelined in itself and lost its right to speak: the clear proof of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into various national and international conflicts, cannot find a common path.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and especially distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became more and more serious, only the US is in the economic situation to save itself without foreign aid.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use it: thus two conditions – under certain circumstances – that are not to be overrated, which otherwise no international organization and no market will be able to resort to in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element, moreover, is perfectly in line with the growing importance that has recently been associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is just now that we were so convinced that we have long since entered a networked empire, a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of immateriality, that we must all at once determine how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can certainly all be transported from one place to the other of the world, but are nevertheless connected to a narrowly circumscribed piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is in advantage over another who lives in a cropless, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a brief insertion.
Those who say territory, those who say government, those who say politics, also say leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing leaderships, especially those of the economy, which have turned out to be insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a certain sense, even more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an intolerance, an image of inexplicability, a sense of distance, all directed towards a whole class of managers of Western countries.
It seems to be the conviction among large parts of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is presented to the majority as becoming more and more alien and more traditional.
The demand for leadership thus feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of the disenfranchisement of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in the sudden change of the collective state of mind of recent times: beginning with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, through the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, towards the rebellion of the American MPs against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value for what is happening today in the lower social strata of the West and is being further intensified by the financial crisis and driven to over-dimensionality.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The superglue that blows up walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and to be able to climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which now seems to have almost reached its destination.
With an adhesive applied on an area of only 2.5 qcm, the researchers succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal, has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged into a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holding capacity of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "can be removed from the wall without problems", says Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at Dayton University.
"This material could be used as a transitory adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
For example, to walk up walls like Spiderman? Perhaps so, but the researchers think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall within the field of space.
So for now, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present a microfibre adhesive that cleans itself from dust like hair by moving on a surface and thus always retains a perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed because of their refreshing quality and vitamin richness especially in the summer, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of both packaged and fresh fruit juices in connection with drug intake. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he once again sounded the alarm: A glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs to the extent that they are virtually eliminated and thus endanger patients' health.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected of being responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs, such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, to toxic levels.
MEDICAMENTS IN DRIVER – The same agency of the medicine had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mix in a report two years ago, stressing that attention should be paid to what is drunk in combination with drugs such as diazepane or metadon.
IT IS NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: "These results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers who are so free to change consumer information.
It is therefore advisable to read the package leaflet at all times and, if there are still uncertainties, not to ask a pharmacist or doctor about any shyness", the expert of the Ansa agency emphasizes.
Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the greatest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001, attacks during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman claimed in an editorial in the New York Times that this second event was more crucial to the history of the United States than the attacks.
A prediction that received a lot of polemics in response and was kept to the economist years later, but is now proving to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the clashes between Enron and Worldcom disappeared from public sight," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style that is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package appears
The OpenOffice.org 3.0 release day has come; the open source software gains an increasing number of users as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself to the public with some new features: in addition to a revised and now more spartan-designed initial menu, a completely guaranteed compatibility with Apple's Mac OS x operating system has finally been achieved, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
In addition, the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007 has been checked, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates e.g. sending via email. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphic editing modules and at the same time to preserve the original appearance of the page.
In this way, "hybride" PDF files can now be generated, which extend the typical graphic of the Adobe format by the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited by multiple hands by different users, thus avoiding conflicts in the case of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each processor is assigned a question to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently publishing various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the definitive result will be made public.
The Italian version is available for download on the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. So it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can have the installation CD sent to your home or office.
However, if the cost-freeness can be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme in private households, it is especially in the area of business where OpenOffice could succeed the big throw: after all, various public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the spreadsheet program aimed at pushing Excel out; Impress, for creating presentations such as PowerPoint; Dbase for operating databases instead of the more popular access; and most recently Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded with already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Also cabbage tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
A new Dopingfall mi frame of the previous Tour de France opens: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is the third-classified and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver who has been tested positively for Cera, the third generation Epo. Previously, this already happened with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of cabbage are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-samples now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
Pierre Bordry, head of the French Antidoping Commission, confirmed the positive epoetin and, according to the Associated Press, also informed the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME IMMIGRATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES FRAGT: IS ITALY RASSISTICAL?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are accepted only with reluctance.
Does this make Belpaese a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated entirely to the theme of racism in Italy, starting from the case of young Burkina Faso-born Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after stealing a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times calls the "paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and work opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega North is recorded".
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times refers to further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that the Pope and the President also underline: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal to work together between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students Victims of up to 900-Euro per room high rental prices
The housing market for students knows no crises.
According to the recent investigation of the Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious features: whole groups of students lose their right to study, because their families are unable to support them at this level" – according to Sunia's head Laura Mariani – "in these cities, the great demand from the students leads to a deforming of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, without a rental price limit, unauthorized sublettings.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which lead to lower rental prices by revising taxation.
On closer examination of the study it turns out that in Milan a sleeping space in the Brianza district is needed about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends at 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, an average sleeping space costs 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where the students are concentrated in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros are needed for a place to sleep, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping space in a double room.
Only a little lower are the rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who avoid in the outskirts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a place to sleep, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive districts, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping space costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they are more important in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting out to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is 25-30% higher than the average is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historical cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the favored multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture by the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening at the moment in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, in the long run means death for the one-room cinema in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the characteristics of a cultural crime.
Most of the places affected are historical places full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with whom you have covered a stretch of street full of emotions", says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", which brought him the Oskar and the great prize of Cannes 20 years ago. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a cinema world that is probably lost forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these mines paid for most of the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the Multiplexkinos, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been recorded: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the lists, 81 in Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Pritti, the president of Anec, "it is useful that new structures also emerge, but first and foremost is the preservation of the already existing one, because including a hall in the city, not all of its regular customers are ready to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here remains the missing budget for the fund of the trade association out of eight: the debt burden recorded by the state amounts to approximately 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not comply with the existing laws.
In order to preserve the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be needed."
It is interesting to note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to its fears about the old cinemas, decided to protect it by means of an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first such agreement in Italy, which aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the measures envisaged are tax advantages for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in terms of local transport: it will be allowed to travel to the traffic-limited areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
"It is a gratifying initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also develop new concepts.
Of course, we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to do something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because the audience of today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to start the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the idea for 10 years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; when I pass the Rialto or Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside to avoid seeing the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The accusations made by the Anti-Mafia Office of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the Municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew, was also handcuffed: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been convicted of involvement in criminal associations of the mafia, at that time to a sum of 10 million euros.
"Despising any kind of moral and legal standard," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli funds for consulting activities."
"This made it possible for the mafia group – according to the judges – to enter the town halls officially and to co-determine the policy of the public administration."
The President of the Calabria Regional Committee, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter links between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such links are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who maintain a white vest."
This morning's arrests follow those of last July, with which the police of the Clan Piromalli were beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and also then due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration – local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after the May 2006 runoff election.
He screamed scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He referred to the Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, whom he accused of having invented everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges, in connection with this morning's arrest warrant, state that the Piromalli clan had even dared to apply for a change to the A3 project.
A wiretapping operation in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case has shown a willingness to respond to the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – making public administration measures identical to the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes out of the waves, suddenly the big ones run up
It is a non-drinking source of money covering over 70% of the planet's surface, and only now do the world's major energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at, and are also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years; it is not by chance that these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil broke down around 1980, the idea of marine energy was gassed, but now the environmental organizations and the rise in oil prices are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of global energy needs could be met by ocean-wave energy.
This would be equivalent to twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are the currents and tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to now rely on marine energy is Enersis, who signed a contract in 2005 for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are now relying on marine energy production.
"Chevron investigates these technologies," says the spokesman of a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal, and weighs the possibility of working with us."
This is about obtaining an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign that is not to be underestimated, especially considering that oil is still being mined by the US, especially in Alaska, and President Bush has only recently launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; even if the details are not known, observers are talking about increasing interest.
Technologies still to be improved.
Experts speak of a technology that is still on the rise, not least because the last doubts on the part of environmentalists have not yet been resolved.
So far, projects such as that in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small scale and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a far greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the floats via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The current is sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned installations of this type, which are only waiting for state approval, and some of the energy gained could also be used for military facilities.
However, Verdant Power is already producing energy for a department store and a parking lot using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Research, the potential that lies in the tides is now worthy of particular interest.
Although it is an irregular phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and waves, and therefore a more trustworthy source of electricity.
Tidal energy in particular is what led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest already $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
