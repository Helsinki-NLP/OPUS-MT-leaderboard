Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, totaling 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought after the first preliminary results the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of previous chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the edge.
In contrast, the Electoral Director of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthian state captain Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse was the ÖVP, which loses almost nine percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in Austria's post-war history, and especially with the People's Party, which demanded the early elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead over the SPÖ.
The voters, however, probably punished the party for making the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about a possible resignation of the party chairman and previous Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party bureau.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to renew the grand coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) received 18 per cent for the time being, while the BZÖ received eleven per cent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed their fear that 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party had reached agreement with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which had even caused sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with each party, is obviously relying on this development and expects to return to Vienna for Austrian federal policy.
The Green Party also entered the parliament, but it suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four per cent hurdle and therefore did not move into parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists charged in India with the illegal collection of beetles, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that there could be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
This was stressed by the minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then surely, there will be some cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
After the talks, Mukherdshi said that it was difficult for the executive to intervene in judicial matters.
In spite of all this, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charge and was fined, the central government wanted to deal with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be resolved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherdshi, to appeal to a higher court.
He could ask for bail to be released and wait in freedom for his verdict, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had made the same statement during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then he could be granted pardon," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to let the condemned "competent legal support" flourish, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance was already offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit this," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists before its partner.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
An answer to the question whether he had received a commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the Minister departed.
"I have already been promised quite a lot," he merely stated.
A Czech judge over the struggle around the seabed
It approaches an electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member team of UN-Divison for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His head, Division Director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, pursues and supplements the interpretation.
Here are working elans and enthusiasm.
So far, the seabed has a little known world, rich in natural springs.
Oil can be found here, ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The countries bordering today vehemently declared their claim to the new sea areas.
After a UN convention, they make use of their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometers from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplifiedly, as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its soles is considered as a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the shore, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the relevant country to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three latter countries have been successful," adds Mikulka.
Australia’s success, which was the first country to significantly expand its maritime areas, was recently met with an international response.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the seabed, which was granted to the country last week by the Commission, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times more than the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profits that they will receive from the use of the seabed in the future will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is referred to by the Convention as the "common heritage of humanity".
In this case, no state has a special position.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not a gold-digger land," says with some exaggeration Director Mikulka, adding that its "individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991 it was granted the status of a "breaking investor" under the Convention, as did investors in a few other countries.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"There you can support over a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic creations that contain nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the legendary Schem, who, according to legend, brought the Golem to life.
German special forces were on site in the event of hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not used.
More and more details are becoming known about the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, both specialists of the Bundeswehr and officials of the GSG 9, the aviation squadron of the Bundespolizei, the Bundeskriminalamt as well as logistics experts of the Technische Hilfswerk were at the site of the liberation.
As spokesmen of the ministries reported on Monday evening, however, the German forces were not needed because the hostage takers let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government had accepted the assistance offered by Germany to involve them as local support forces.
"Fortunately, this did not happen," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers had kidnapped the group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions in southern Egypt on 19 September.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad had been carried back and forth.
The identity of the hostage takers remained unclear until the end as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages were in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on details of the release.
At first there was no information in Berlin about when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Luftwaffe and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US Representative House Refuses Rescue Package
The first chamber of the US Congress has barely failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones burst into the depths.
By 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the government's bailout package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by US President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority in favour of the programme aimed at curbing the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the proponents had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on MEPs to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones broke in by more than six percent or by 600 points.
The investors were worried that the state bailout might fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the failure had become known, fell again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence on the international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary for the entry into force of the programme.
Organizers record increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
According to a study, sales for travel bookings for the coming months increased significantly compared to the previous year - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, according to a study, the Germans' desire to travel remains unclouded.
In the bookings for the winter season, the rice offices recorded a turnover increase of 31 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to the investigation of the market research institute GfK, booking figures have also increased for the autumn months.
For example, the turnover increase of travel agencies for October was around 11 percent compared to 2007, according to the DRV.
The basis for these results are figures from the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and extrapolates for the total market.
This includes travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travels to the USA in particular are in demand, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in the booking amounted to about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic areas of the Germans, are particularly sought after destinations.
In particular, travel packages would be very popular, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising costs for energy and food, the costs here are "better calculable for the customer than for individually organised holidays".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early bird discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that there will again be a turnover increase compared to the previous year - although, according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from liter mugs and celebrities in designer dirndln.
It's a Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is blonde, TV presenter and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: Hardly three minutes on the meadow, the photographers are already rushing at us and snapping the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first meadow visit.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to have its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the Weißwurstäquator, the feeling of well-being in the costume was still limited.
But first arrived on the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather hosn; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only reaps my dirndl apron.
A Munich woman draws my attention to the fact that I had tied the apron incorrectly: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, right forgave, back widowed."
Secretly, I'm freezing the loop from the back to the left.
"Fits," said it and laughs.
Others make less effort about subtle flirting techniques and wear plain felt hats on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and stretch the naked back of you uninvited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-drawn "oooooo".
That's what he tells me after getting rid of his previously drunk measurements.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks he's a trash can.
So Bob's one of those infamous "Wildbieslers."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of the alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics run in droves across the festival square, who have to take care of the poor sippers.
The nurses always perform in the pack - always four at a time drag a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
This works like with most Wiesn visitors: Empty down, full back.
You can't see who's under the tarpaulin in the Promille sarge.
"These are the ones where goarnimmer packs," one of the paramedics called to me on request and disappeared in the commotion.
Name of the victim of the accident announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, resident at Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road in the city centre.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of reckless driving.
Meanwhile, he was released on bail.
Turkey widens the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in entering deep into Turkey's hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavour.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guides tell you.
The building sits riding at the end of the platforms with a tower at every corner of the front and looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building disintegrates about
But once you're inside the arched ticket counter, there's no doubt about the grandeur of the project whose westernmost access this was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late-warmer in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and further on to what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist plans became lame during the First World War.
His railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 an ammo train flew into the air, destroying the artistic roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disintegrated, far from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and all east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of the Tükei.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a large new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the neighbouring regions, generated by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key figures of this new foreign policy, I have boarded the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the ACP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is regarded as a new city, for the new secular state plan to turn its back on the Ottoman past.
But the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has caused a lot of mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the main office of the AKP, a custom-made ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-finished shopping centers and pubs where middle managers met in suits, both men and women, to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The goal of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today, she has to look east and west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But surely Turkey could eventually," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to face this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to almost routinely stated: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the embassy seems to be able, figuratively speaking, to drive Europe as a whole on the same railway tracks east of Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German lords, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting at the dock for the ferry to take me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At the time, at least, there seemed not to be much doubt as to which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Death" Handley (Obituary on September 11th) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was intended for young people up to 21 years old, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changer of forms) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to tackle any piece of music presented to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for music, which for years never let go.
How often did death stop us from "letting the music speak for itself".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never overpowering but never overpowering.
Whatever the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed by one - often I've been inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He abhorred conductors who, according to his words, simply "went with one or two famous showhorses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (25 September) you write that "he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship in 1950 ... while at the same time he was studying for a BSc, an MA and a doctorate.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it's not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for good and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
'I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life', because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention to them because of their simplicity and the power they radiate, how they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magical moments.'
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November Honda starts marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor had a large interior, this large-scale saloon offers a much larger interior.
In addition, there are the technical subtleties that allow even more comfortable driving and saving petrol.
Changes before the coming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made to this grand limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before you start analyzing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter period of time.
Although Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales on other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of 2002 and also in the course of 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10 000 cars, which is 17% of the estimated growth on the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of the total sales at Honda in Spain.
As far as the new generation of the model is concerned, the managers of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More specifically, the release of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover up the sales cut in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to end the year with a total sale of 22 000 models, which is 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
This is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 metres in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 models a year throughout the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The market launch of Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, and its first public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due on the one hand to the new room flexibility program and on the other hand to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
Also the capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading area, reaches up to 339 liters, i.e. 19 liters larger than the capacity of the trunk of the first generation.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the 1.4-litre petrol version, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz trunk with a 1.2-litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, apart from the additional features such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, an improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of gasoline engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first version with 1.2 litres achieves the power of 90 hp at 6,000 rotations with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This gasoline engine - the predecessor of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS 1.4 has 5.4 litres of gasoline consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
`Auto bee' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired this time by nature, more precisely by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarm behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the technical development center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is supposed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds up its own oval flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the bee's facet eyes, which can be seen in all directions over an angle of 300 degrees, allowing her to fly undisturbed in her personal airspace without interruption.
In order to recreate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles that are up to two metres apart in front of the BR23C and are 180 degrees radius, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an in-vehicle microprocessor, which is directly translated into signal for avoiding collision
`At the moment when obstacle is noticed, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this evasive maneuver is absolutely instinctive.
If it weren't, the robot might not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the senior engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot cannot deviate upwards or downwards, nor can it be overtly; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and in infinite ways as the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
`This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and to act according to this information.
It does not require saving neither the information nor the intuitive logic of the maneuvers done, so it can work continuously with just a few more dozen KB of storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even the MBs of the disk space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan predicts to introduce in the next ten years at serial cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than variety of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite, in order to lead to the goal while driving, avoiding the obstacles on the way.
She's shaking before she gets mortgaged.
One must realize that the US Treasury Department, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid US citizens getting involved in mortgage stories of supposedly payable banks, an entertaining and informative game was developed for the internet surfers: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or perhaps, the 'hotel of bad loans' or of confusion.
The third aspect of this accommodation, and especially its receptionist, is to think once, twice, and up to three times whether it is the moment not to ask for any credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
She certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a side for teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, if a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley makes its capital available for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, making it the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, an innovation due to a strong fall in its stock market price.
One week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at a uniform price of $25.25, which amounts to a total of $3 billion.
The assumed price is less than 19% of the share price of August 31st.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares that will secure a 10% profit and can be resold at a price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be conducted on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, which is 28% above the current price.
The Morgan Stanley share, however, declined by 6.79% to 23.07 dollars at 17.00 GMT.
"This strategic link is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to holding bank status," said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley assumed this status last week, which is supposed to allow him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest names of Wall Street to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement was changed over the last few days: last Monday Morgan simply declared that she would sell up to 20% of her shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
'A week ago', Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, said in Tokyo, 'we thought that the stake would be made up entirely of common shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce risks and secure ourselves.'
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its market value for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go with a reduction in profit of about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preference shares into common shares if the latter are exchanged more than 50% above the sales value within a given period, i.e. approximately 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds supplied by MUFG will allow him to exploit investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a press spokesman of the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that since the end of August his balance sheet has been 'clearly' lowered.
The last few weeks have been hard for the group that had to watch their stock market price fall by half, while the price of insurance against insolvency has skyrocketed.
This price declined on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivors' of the big investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that they had withdrawn 15 billion dollars, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Refounding the Republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorialian Rafael Correa.
It was that third person who, following the example of his like-minded and friends, put the plan of a new constitution for election this Sunday.
Mission accomplished, because according to the public results, which amounted to 80% of the vote, 64% voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'No', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were delivered empty.
For the constitutional project to be adopted, more than half of all votes cast must be cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations' exits and a census of a non-governmental organisation announced a clear victory for 'yes', and 63% to 70% predicted it.
In the night from Sunday to Monday Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way', he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held silently in accordance with the observation order of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text consisting of 444 points in order to secure 'new socialism' for which the President is committed.
The constitutional project transfers state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives largely from oil production by foreign companies and from foreign currencies that send emigrants to the country.
The plan, promoted by the Correa elected in 2006, also grants the head of state greater power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the possibility of disbanding the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and aspire to a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
In the end, it also intends to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Equatorian base as a base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command started the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital healthy and intact this Monday afternoon.
In the morning they were liberated from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the Al-Maza military base right next to Cairo International Airport at around 3.30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to talk to the press, on board a helicopter to the Maadi Hospital, a foreigners' district of Cairo, to be examined there.
They all enjoy 'best health' and 'no ransom was paid to the kidnappers', explained the Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna on the runway.
After being captured on 19 September in an off-road safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hideout to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
There are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the agency Egyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer stated that 30 members of the Special Forces, from on board two helicopters, launched the attack at night just before dawn.
"On both sides, shots were fired and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled," said this person in charge who wants to remain anonymous.
He stated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian Special Forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is now, on the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian Special Forces.
'We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men from the intelligence and the special units', he explained without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
The evening before, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped an off-road vehicle in a patrol that contained the hijackers, killing six of them, including the leader from Chad, and two arrests.
The army declared that they were in contact with a rebel group from Darfur, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), which immediately denied this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is central to the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the pitiful sums given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that starve miserably?
Which politician will dare to remind the Federal Government that it is neglecting its monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no real laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is making 3.5 million euros available solely for the restoration of the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbours are told in their country's constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all MPs and all government districts, in mutual consultation.
In Quebec, in the Association of the History Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 historical societies are trying to deal intensively with history, save the numerous private archives with a few penny, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of despair when supporters and decision makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux countries want to help the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which is in turmoil as a result of the US financial crisis: the three countries provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institute, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner for Competition of the European Commission.
In the eurozone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions that are now being taken in connection with the Bank could have a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank to about 49 percent.
The bank will probably sell part of its holdings, especially the insurance activities purchased last year by the Dutch ABN Amro.
The shares of the Fortis started a steep decline last week, and serious crisis scenarios were already emerging in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too large for bankruptcy.
The institution's securities fell by 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the market value of the Group is EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to the management.
In the management's view, the USD 700 billion US bailout package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets are to blame for the decline in Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new Director-General of the Bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but there was no interested party with an objective offer.
However, the Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor should tremble for his money, it said.
There has been no panic among customers, the bank's branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, the Fortis has independent branches, but it also names leasing companies as its own.
Fox in the henhouse
Because of a person’s drug use, life and health insurance companies in America often refuse to sign a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of the drug data to the consent of the data subject in any case.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we entrust the fox to the chickens" - quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance companies set the fees and the payment amounts in case of damage depending on the customer's health and if the risk is overestimated, the insurance is not even completed.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was concluded only with knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: using the customer's identification number, he obtains the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, i.e., which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from it which disease the customer suffers from and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering medication, it could be concluded that his blood fat level is untreatable, which would automatically put him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so insurance companies only have to deal with the paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the drawbacks is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as migraines and hot flushes, but also depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the insurer's point of view, while the above mentioned does not.
For the retrieval and processing of the data, own societies have formed which, before obtaining the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not yet been punished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and combine them with the data on drug use, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the patient's health.
More and more companies have access to the data and control of their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its impact only extends to health service providers and insurance companies.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program further, so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned can hardly prohibit access to his data, since the insurance companies do not otherwise conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are in some way left to the fox's mercy.
Global menu from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are both leading trading partners of each other, this was the main topic, along with other global problems, at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indian summit is also taking place, which is mainly about cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic great power that should be given more voice and say when it comes to international concerns, member states have not yet been able to agree whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not even discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseilles yesterday.
The French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomate Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. increase to a good EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods had increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this target is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into an agreement, so that air transport will also be boosted in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India's number one partner, New Delhi is only 9th among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
Among them was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and the convening of a UN conference was also urgised.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides to blame for its failure.
The EU stressed that it is sticking to its energy and climate programme, i.e. that pollutant emissions should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed with this, as did the proposal to make a kind of global compromise at the next climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
Food prices should also be combated, so both support the call for an international conference on the subject of financial crisis.
The Indian head of government is today visiting the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it is hoped that orders will be made to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the Agency's reports, the agreement is to be concluded for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair is expecting more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will spread over the 171.790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honour of the event.
The Undersecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government in the exhibition hall during the opening ceremony: Italy will represent the 264 m2 exhibition space "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the Book Fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives around the publishing industry in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers decreases throughout, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
Found the billionaire Steve Fossett's small plane that disappeared a year ago
The small aircraft of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007 was found.
The items have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m altitude, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the aircraft.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely dispelled the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located, and a troop has been sent to do so. Now we have the certainty that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or near it.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Road Safety (Ntsb) noted that a crew was sent out just a few hours after the sighting of the aircraft, which identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett had taken off on a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, in California, near the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal belongings were found by a couple near their home at Mammoth Lakes.
These are two passports with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history through a long succession of records.
In 2002, he was the first person to circle the world ball in a hot air balloon in his sixth attempt: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without a stopover by plane.
Among his numerous records is also a flight of 15445 m above the Andes, this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv that falls out of the traditional patterns due to its original design and special lines, the extending surface and its clear angles.
With this offroader, Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector.
Due to its exceptional characteristics, the presentation of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
Thus, the advertising drum that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – a novelty in the automotive sector in the backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, which will be carried out in various fibers, which will occupy the central shopping street of Milan, the Corso Como, by 15 November.
The first façade will consist of the presentation of the car in form, whereby 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como will give the whole a special look: the new Suv will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear to emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details in different moments, in order to put itself together again as a whole.
Without a doubt, the aim of Mercedes with this advertisement is to introduce a new kind of autoreclamation into this rather stereotyped field.
But will it be possible to attract the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
They're from Triveneto – now they're risking stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom all of Italy is ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been traveling after the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, did not cause any serious problems until recently.
Never before has there been clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right milieu.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia joined them in Sofia.
They carry the Tricolori, on which the cities of militants appear: however, they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a clash with a truly radical right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
The Figc had provided the Italian fans with 144 cards for the game: all were issued in names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among those who travelled to Sofia, there was no one with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already preloaded in this respect, were denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban which prevents access to stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans won't put a foot in a stadium anymore.
Thank God.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation offenders, who could follow these little more than 150.
"This fire must be withdrawn immediately, and this does not in any case give such behaviour the opportunity to justify it," says the Viminal.
Therefore, "eyes to especially also with a view to the match of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
Indeed, there is a small nucleus of the Italian ultras in Puglia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (Sports Supervision) gathers, on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services dealing with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed in no joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Frenchsco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, now comes from.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but without a doubt the behaviour of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist – adds No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are punished in the country of their deed.
So far, this group had been in check, but now it has to be reconsidered what has happened and what will happen.
But let us also speak of the whistles during the anthem Mamelis: even though this is not a crime, but allow me, there is no education...".
