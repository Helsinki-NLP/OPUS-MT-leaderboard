This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely used, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot deliver, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal on the top was chestnut brown and on the underside light or carotenoid color.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called Rachis, but have other features of feathers – barbs and barbules – the researchers concluded that the Rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or for heart-owning. The researchers assumed that the sample, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the plumage of a mature and not the downs of a chick.
The researchers claimed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and no chick down.
A car bomb detonated on the morning of yesterday in the police headquarters of the Turkish Gaziantep, killed two policemen and wounded over twenty more people.

They have found that the Sun works on the basis of the same basic principles as other stars: It has been found that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation and nothing else.
In order to determine the Rossby number of a star associated with the plasma current, the luminosity and rotation are taken together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic field reversals.

The work was largely theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the earth and causes the tides, the Milky Way also exerts attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists came to the conclusion that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter is in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cabin and put a preprinted sheet of paper on which the candidate of their choice is registered in an envelope.
After the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter's list.
The French electoral law lays down the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that there are no envelopes at the start of the election and that no envelopes are imposed, except for those of properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives who attend each part of the process as witnesses. In the evening, the votes of volunteers are counted under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

Her first was the slalom, in which she received a "Did not Finish" in her first race. 36 of the 116 participants achieved the same result in this race.
Her other race, the giant slalom, ended with 10th place in the women's group with a combined running time of 4:41.30. Thus she was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes faster than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished ninth.
Four skiers of crutch skiing did not reach the finish, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom could not place themselves in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and secured her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police President Chandra Shekhar Solanki claimed that the defendants had appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed in, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered considerable injuries to his head.
The road on which the accident had occurred was temporarily blocked, while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
As a result, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
In the meantime, Adekoya was charged with murdering her son before the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
It is in custody until the prosecution and trial, but testimony from eyewitnesses may be falsified, as its image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary is working differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes: "Journalists seem to cross a dangerous limit if you publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which leads the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the prosecution.
According to Leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians demand that the borders be reset before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other themes that are supposedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley of ten years from the signing of the agreement, but the Palestinian Authority only wants to accept such a presence for five years.
The shooters of the accompanying pest control experiment should be closely supervised by rangers, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Managing Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training lessons.
Martelly sworn in a new Provisional Election Commission (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread dissident protests that began in October.
The trigger for the partly violent protests was the non-execution of elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating of damaged iPods were reported, triggering a total of six fires and four people suffered slight burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
"Last week, the METI announced that it had been informed by Apple about 34 other incidents of overheating that the company described as "not serious."
The Ministry reacted by calling the postponement of the report by Apple 'really regrettable'.
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Civil Protection Office said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had also stated that there was no evidence of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 gun.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an older lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a medical career.
He trained as a maternity doctor and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his work at the hospital, Liggins began to examine premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the use of a hormone accelerated the pulmonary maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black box recorders on Wednesday.
Ringer colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman.""
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels made the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as I was ... maybe even crazier ... I love her and will miss her ... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, the proportion of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, temporary Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the respondents share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of respondents said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medalist at the Olympic Games was to swim at the Commonwealth Games in 100 m and 200 m freestyle as well as in three tiers, but due to his many complaints his fitness was doubted.
He was not able to take the necessary medications to overcome his pain, as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of earth’s water supply, along with organic matter that can form proteins and make life possible.
As comets collided with Earth a long time ago, the scientists promise insights into how planets, especially the Earth, emerge.
Cuomo (53) took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He described the rumours as 'political gossip and stupidity'.
It is speculated that he could apply for the office of president in 2016.
NextGen is a system of which the FAA claims that it would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older technology based on ground radar to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional means of transport are set up and the above-ground trains will not stop in Wembley. There are no parking spaces or park-and-ride facilities available on site.
With concern about the lack of transport possibilities, the chances grew that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the fans of the team.
A study published in Science on Thursday reported the emergence of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within only two generations, although it had previously been assumed that this process lasted much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrated cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled to a thin wire that can be turned and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metal. It can be made so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images, called picture manuscripts, in books called picture manuscripts.
This is called the PH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemicals tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which their electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels funny and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China there were toilets. In Roman culture toilets were sometimes part of public baths that visited men and women in mixed society.
If you're calling someone thousands of miles away, then use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was transported from a rocket to space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our gaze somewhat.
It takes a gigantic rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to shoot a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The biggest service that the wheel has done to us is much easier and faster transport.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other means of transport.
Among them are cats of medium size, which eat prey of medium size, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-scattering domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey animals such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task that every cat has and that ensures that they do not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called pack.
The pack consists of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and boys.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion pack act similar to wolf or dog pack, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in their behaviour and are just as deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump large distances and draw with the five times force of a strong person.
The tiger is in the same group (type Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the full-bodied roar of the lion, but rather like a sentence of growling roaring words.
Ozelots eat small animals. If they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals that the Ozelot hunts are much smaller than himself.
Scientists think that Ozelote pursues and detects animals with their sense of smell, and they sniffs at where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the darkness with night vision and move unnoticed. Ozelots hunt their prey by visually conforming to their surroundings and then rushing onto their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (e.g. when they move over a mountain range or a river or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adjustments to be a strong competitor than what it previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less similar to the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations then look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen, inhale human beings, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce their food via the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. We feed mainly on plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the greatest predator of his time, so he was afraid of nothing but other Mosasauris.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another set on the palate, which meant that there was no escape for any animal crossing its path.
We don't know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue, feeding on turtles, big fish, other Mosasaurs, and maybe even being a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that came into the water; even a great dinosaur like T. Rex was not up to him.
While the majority of their food may be known to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called sleepers.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, while the rich men preferred to hold a banquet together, where they were lying on their side while eating their meals.
Courts of ancient Rome could not contain food that came to Europe in later centuries from America or Asia.
For example, they had neither corn nor tomatoes nor potatoes nor cocoa, and no old Roman has ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of God.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and through ceremonies and feasts the priests tried to conform to the will of the gods.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar space, which could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called Zikkurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the yard. Shops simply consisted of shops open to the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Old Norse legends say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. As he continued to travel west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes lived there already at that time.
Although all countries were "scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film "The Legacy of the Templars", you may think that a treasure map has been drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words 'original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776'. The text is located upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 293⁄4 inches x 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage at the beginning of his life.
It is therefore possible that the endorsement was simply added as a mark.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles freed the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"It was dominated by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them."
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
After only two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation troops had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is an independent culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state, and which also somehow defines the size of a society.
City states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transfer of knowledge over several generations, a continuing cultural footprint and an appropriate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as real civilizations.
During the revolutionary struggles, the 13 states first formed a weak central government, based on the federal treaty, which consisted only of Congress.
The Congress was not authorized to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, it relied on the state authorities, which often did not cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
He also had no power to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team together with the German national football team is the second most successful in the world and was FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water ball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One motor sports.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions and Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic games.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
"Due to the cluster/group of islands, Japan has been geographically referred to as "Archipel"."
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a branch in southwest Taiwan, introducing a change in indigenous grain cultivation methods and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan the province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Chinese-Japanese War (1894-1895), the government of the Qing Dynasty signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, in which it transferred sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the room of the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of what they originally looked like.
Until 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu have been restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world's most widely used still image format is 35 mm, which corresponds to the prevailing film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still being manufactured today, but more importantly, its image format has been taken over by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the so-called 35 mm format confusingly measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
The much-disgusted and often mocked third rule is a simple directive that creates dynamism and at the same time preserves a measure of order in one image.
It states that the intersection point of the lines that dilate a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example).
In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was on the test.
For more than a thousand years the Christian religion had held the European states together despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled everyone, from king to ordinary citizen.
One of the important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the funds of the churches exist for this very reason.
The central power of the Church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was complied with.
Soon after the outbreak of fighting, Great Britain initiated a sea blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, since it separated the country from vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade was contrary to the generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sea sections, which even posed a threat to neutral ships.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to join the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the USA with 4 cents in his possession, a book with poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his superior at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way to display different ages. Every period of time in China and every family that was in power was its own dynasty.
Between the individual dynasties there were also inconstant times of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which took place for 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasty.
In these times fierce wars raged among many noblemen who fought for the throne.
The time of the three kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a turning from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, as well as the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
After the revolution, all occupations were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same is true of the military, because instead of class membership, the army rankings were now based on the calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and offers a vivid picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if you know that it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave very little can be seen or heard from this world.
The Cheopspyramide is the only of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Cheops pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to worship the late Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or Giza Necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombstones and temples were built in honor of Cheop's wives and family members.
The "Strike" symbol looks like a V and the "Strike" symbol looks like a bracket or a square where the bottom line is missing.
Upstairs means that you should start at the top and slide the bow. Downstairs means that you start at the frog (this is where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow.
Painting usually generates a softer sound, while painting is stronger and more expressive.
You can add your own pencil markers, but remember that the printed sheet markings are there for musical reasons, which is why they should normally be respected.
The panicking King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, her two little children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women in Versailles on 6 October 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming mob of people threatening the king and the queen.
The mob forced King and Queen to open wide the windows of their carriages.
At some point a member of the angry crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The war expenditures of the U.S. imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of the expenses, and interest on bonds flowed through Wall Street bank houses on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super-profits derived from the continuing exploitation of the Philippine people represented the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the foundation of the Order.
The epoch in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in agreement around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general notions. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are more inherent than social.
One can say, for example, that the passenger car inevitably involves the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread car ownership also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new health care techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that drew on writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures arose with reference to this geography and these, since they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of today's world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined in the course of the twelfth century, mainly due to the return of the Crusaders with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offer of the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of the fashion capital of the world moved from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and the 14th centuries.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East.
However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fix clothes.
Demand management is agriculture that aims to produce just so much food that it meets the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological, cultivation method that uses conserved seed native to the eco-region and combines it with alternating field farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers used subsistence farming, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished from others in terms of age, ethnicity, class, place and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that delimit a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical, or a combination of these factors.
The members of a subculture often signal their affiliation by a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
"Such children are called "wilder" or wild. Some feral children were held captive by people (usually their own parents); in some cases the neglect of the child was due to the inability of the parents to accept the child's considerable intellectual or physical limitations."
Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before being exposed or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When reared completely by animals, the wild child shows behaviors (within the limits of his physical possibilities) that are almost completely in line with those of his specific foster animal, such as his fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, "scaffolding" goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that supports individuals in a novel learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student alone may not be able to handle.
Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and educational, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the nursing care system is a piece of safety for these children.
Our care family system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The care centre is supposed to cover all the needs they had not received in the home from which they were previously taken out.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of benefits and rewards.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are used as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "continuing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects of Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, a few milliseconds of continuous facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that one can see if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.x
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who can no longer understand language due to brain damage can still correctly assess the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation ensures new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation back and forth.
Outside in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human to meet his need for amino acid from available plant sources.
It also has serious consequences if we do not: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
On the whole, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" in the same way as the chimpanzees in the savannah today.
Sleep reduction is the process of targeted waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep for a short time (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you are someone who introduces the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another possibility based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of fluid before going to bed (especially water or tea known for its diuretic effect) so that you are forced to stand up to urinate.
The level of inner calm that a person possesses, in reverse, correlates with the level of tension in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force is. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been extended to include the path of Mahayana's love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (reconnaissance energy) is awakened by yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is the God Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the end of the war, the clash of systems, the course and culture led to the countries becoming hostile.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It should last for the next 40 years and in reality will be carried out by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939 the Polish defense had already completely collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and reposition along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers invaded the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created them after they invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains able to transport people and goods, while at the same time hindering the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. Americans tried to bring staff and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zāgros Mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as farm animals in order to easily get to their milk, fur, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pastures. The goats were cared for by goat herdsmen, much like the more well-known shepherds; often they were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, support tracks were built in England.
Although the conveyor tracks consisted only of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses that pulled the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Thresholds were introduced quite early in order to secure the position of the rails. Gradually, however, the realization prevailed that rails carrying a strip of iron are more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known method of movement was walking. Man began to walk two million years ago with the advent of Homo Erectus (meaning "upright man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk so regularly.
Two-footed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
This is in many cases just like a symptomatic treatment. However, if you do not want temporary solutions, then we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is truly obvious that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity and that the problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of people.
After his approval by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap’s printery.
Over the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known today as Dunlap Broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was given to John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broad pages, which still exist, are the oldest still existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that have survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits to use the computer jargon.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that you cannot immediately make a diagnosis.
The best sign of poisoning by swallowing can be the presence of an open container containing drugs or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this special poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term derives from the age-old familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adaptable in parasitising humans.
Both predatory bugs and bed bugs are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or the dwelling of their hosts.
In the United States of America there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interests of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can opt for an adoption plan for their baby.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents give up their parents' rights so that another couple can take over the parenthood.
The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is in fact the basis of most scientific investigations.
However, it is not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that serves to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; scientific research is also guided by questions and the conduct of observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all science issues, including psychology, were recognized.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often largely based on the presence of the body's own cycles and their production by biological clocks.x
Behaviours determined by a cycle, which are not only reactions to signs of external cycles, are known in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-preserving oscillators that perform free-swinging cycles even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey Chase experiment was one of the key indications that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to incorporate their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they identified either the DNA of the phagen with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phagen with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation involved, the importance of the piece of genetic material in question and whether the cells concerned are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting nature areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is the visit, photography and study of Orangutangs in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to drive to their workplace and are passed by others whose jobs are in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic commuting, all are in some way connected to and support a transport system based on private cars.
Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has borne human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.x
In developed countries, you will rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such grievances, why do they fail every day? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the two.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because one cannot predict driver behavior with 100% safety.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave fairly consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be mathematically rough.
In order to better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three main characteristics were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find more efficient food and sexual partners.
Most insects can fold their wings back along their bodies.
As a result, they have a wider range of small hatches in which they can hide from predators.
Today dragonflies and day flies are the only insects that cannot fold back their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the centre of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), is moving around the earth.
That seems reasonable, since it doesn't seem like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river on earth. It runs more than eight times as water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, some up to six miles wide.
A total of 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans across the planet’s rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main stream is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It absorbs water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids of stone continued until the end of the Old Reich, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Empire marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, who were at that time about a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since ancient times, since they can all be found in their original form in nature and mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This corresponded more to the four aggregate states (in the same order): established, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also set up the theory that they are transformed into new substances in order to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe consists in its entirety of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
As a result, after his invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the pencil has stepped into the background with the advent of newer writing methods, so that it has been pushed back in its status and use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to come near a sharpener.
One may be curious what will become of the keyboard if something new comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy car up a hill. If the core is split again, part of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate with little or no offense at all.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearby side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side there could be more Maria, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to climb to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that are internalized in the course of their growing up.
These theories deal with what causes certain people to want exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do or not to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of demand hierarchy and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, when managers begin to lead their former colleagues, two types of behaviour can emerge: one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the boys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary measures, performing performance assessments, assigning responsibilities and taking employees into account.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and makes everything their own.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to discord between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are run according to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be taken into account by the local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The "invisible team" is the leadership team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.x"
Why would an organisation take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organisation? One goal for the practical implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively across all specialist departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the joint work of an organisation to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process of responding to the customer's need.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. Thus, they narrow down the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injuries, and tumors, affect behavior and cause changes in some brain functions.
New emerging technologies allow us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our heads.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI covers the production of machines for the automation of tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, setting up strategies and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real life problems.
Today, the AI system is widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, and has also been integrated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class. Often, a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus ride is out of the question.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum pieces from the classroom, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
Virtually sharing an excursion is also a great way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. The website is rebuilt every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing skills. While students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blog experience, this usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog author struggles to improve his writing style in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging “also forces the students to learn more about the world around them”. The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires the students to write wisely and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning far outside the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through the active response to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and present their own perspectives on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and is characterized by a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further to the south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north the untouched beauty of nature spreads in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more characterize Ontario as what is considered typical Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the US than Canada has citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, as far as wildlife is concerned, its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belonging to France and known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam into the country, and he was very successful on the Comoros and in Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (only none that looks too expensive.
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider an assault, and that it is not unusual to be persecuted by arm-wrapping, etc.
Stay consistent when you reject men, and do not shy away from defending your position (cultural differences back or forth; that does not mean that it is okay!)
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century before the beginning of the era and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca only to give it up after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who set up trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole spectrum of tinnef are sold, but that's all for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any stay outside Gomas should be carefully planned to experience the status of fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the volcano Nyiragongo and for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use bodabos (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short drive.x
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Although Timbuktu is regarded as a tourist attraction and has an airport due to its reputation, it is now an impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most important stations of Louis Gate's PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in strong contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has an Arab flair rather than an African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered to be the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily protection and entrance fees.
It can also be worthwhile to buy a Wild Card that grants access to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name given to the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared with a dazzling bar chart visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.x
For the best views of Hong Kong you should leave the island and drive to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urbanization is crowded on newly acquired land along the north coast.
This is the place the British colonists have made their own. If you are looking for traces of the colonial past of the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world and extend over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands to the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not only mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining stocks of the mighty jungle that once covered the Gange plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which one third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengali king tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer there.
Buses depart from the cross-district bus station (on the other side of the river) all day long, with most buses, especially those to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leaving between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses between the districts are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are driven by small Japanese coaster buses that are cozy and stable.x
Collectible taxis offer a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable bridge that spans the river Oyapock and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, their length is 378 meters and it has two lanes with a width of 3.50 m.
The crossing height under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but traffic clearance was not completed until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited today's East Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also operated subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of native tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, collecting and fishing.x
Paraguay, formerly called the Greater Province of West India, was born in the 16th century as a result of the meeting of the Spanish conquerors with the indigenous indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for its polo team and players being among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.x
Information on competitions and points of sale for polo game tickets can be found at Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is determined in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island that is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British Pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and on Stanley credit cards. US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, but British and US currency can be accepted; check with the owners in advance what payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.x
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely go below freezing point, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no pronounced rainy or dry seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park see the sight of humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the Park Authority, visitors should stay at least 100 yards/metres away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/metres away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bisons, wapitis, elks, bears and practically all the big animals can work, it can happen that they are going to attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them enough space.
Also, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking highly fragrant foods, and watch out for a clean stock.
Apia is the capital of Samoa and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 50s of the 18th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of an inglorious naval patrol in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the chief chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland stretches over two ports, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour District) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe bathing facilities and most offer shade donated by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a beautiful shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better tolerated.
You can drink the local tap water without hesitation, but if you are worried, you will also find bottled water.
"For Australians, the idea of coffee "Flat White" is strange. A small black is "Espresso", cappuccino is filled high with cream (not with foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.x
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, observe all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Dice jellyfish occur near the beach and near river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They may occasionally occur outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
A booking in advance gives the traveller the certainty that he will have a place to stay after arriving at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agency.x
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
You can also hold back your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g. Visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be addressed to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to what's happening, you have to go early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that on parts of the festival music is still played late into the night, even if the music on the main stages has already stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as breaking ice causes quite terrible noise for the most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg also offer time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually try hard to keep guests on site for as long as possible and spend a lot of money. There are usually neither windows nor clocks, and exits are sometimes hard to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and make sure they stay.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players realize how important it is to stay sober.
If you want to ride in high latitudes or over mountain passes, you should expect snow, ice and temperatures below freezing point.
On icy and snowy roads the adhesion is low and you cannot drive, as if you are on bare asphalt.
In snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
The visibility may also be affected by falling or floating snow or condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.x
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues for the most part throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari means a country trip in the usual language to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and the standard equipment allows a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy and you can watch them better with binoculars.
A foot safari (also known as "bush walk", "walking safari" or "footing") consists of a hike that takes either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Olympic summer games after being the venue for the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March most cancellation policies did not apply until July 2020, due to the Coronavirus, for which the Olympic Games were planned.
It is assumed that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500¥ and 130.000¥, an average ticket of about 7,000¥.
Ironing damp clothing can help dry. Many hotels lend iron and ironing board, even if you are not present in the room.
If no iron is available or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful that the substance does not get too hot (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, lead to burns).
There are various methods of cleaning water, some of which prove to be more effective in counteracting certain hazards.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others it must be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers can encounter animal pests that they do not know from their home regions.
Vermins can destroy food, cause irritation, or at worst even cause allergic reactions, poison, or spread disease.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals, which can harm or kill people by force, are usually not classified as vermin.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers whose destination country has a high level of taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially for products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on Highway Buffalo-Pittsburgh is probably the biggest driving challenge, as it often leads through remote, untapped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep in mind: steep gradients, narrow lanes and sharp curves prevail here.
The specified speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, however, mobile coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite delicious. In Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, as well as with the southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit biscuits are widely used, with apples being cooked all year round to make pastries and cherries and plums used in summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often fit particularly well with a cup of strong coffees.
If you want to produce small but rich baked goods, try what is called Berlin, pancakes or doughnuts depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
Curry may be either 'dry' or 'humid' depending on the amount of liquid.
In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a generic term that includes a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without further attributes, it usually refers to the food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is common throughout the archipelago today, offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes. The Javanese prefer peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially javanian coconut blossom sugar) and a range of aromatic spices.
stirrups are aids for the feet of the riders who hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and catches his foot on the stirrup, he can be dragged along when the horse passes through. In order to keep this risk as low as possible, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, quite narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety handles that allow a stirrup belt to fall off the saddle as soon as it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile's most important climbing destination, known as Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world always discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill skiing, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where skis or snowboards are attached to your feet and a slope descends over a snow-covered surface.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes also known as "skipenners" who plan their entire holiday around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings with representations of skiers go back to 5000 BC!
The origins of ski descent as a sport go back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first leisure ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Hiking with backpack: This activity is also called skiing or skiing.
It is similar to alpine touring or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include it, as the latter are carried out in steep terrain and require much firmer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions, you are able to travel a little longer distances than when hiking – only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on well-kept trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but has many independent countries. Normally, you would have to apply for visas several times and pass through several passport controls if you want to travel through several countries.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area functions a little like a country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can normally cross the borders without having to pass through the passport control again.
Accordingly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen Member States individually, saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no general definition of what items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition shows geographical variations where the age limit may be lower in areas such as North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products could be called 'antic', although they are younger than similar products from mass production.
Reindeer farming is an important source of Sámi's livelihood, and the culture around trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
Also in the past not all Sámi have bred large-scale reindeer, but have lived on fishing, hunting and the like. Reindeer kept them mainly as train animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
"Even though the term "Gypsy" is used mainly by non-Roma, it is often regarded as offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma."
If a travel notice is issued for the country you are visiting, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of governments other than yours, but their advice is tailored to your own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face situations other than Europeans or Arabs.
Discussions are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information found elsewhere.
Severe weather is the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disturbances or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of it that depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of storms, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, water pants and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal storms include Blizzards, snowstorms, icestorms and duststorms.
Travellers are urgently warned to pay attention to any type of storm affecting their territory, as this may affect all travel plans.
Anyone who plans to travel a country considered a war zone should do professional training for it.
"An Internet search for ""course on hostile environments"" will probably display the address of a local company."
A course covers all the problems discussed here usually in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes gun training.
There are numerous books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning a gender-equalisation operation abroad must ensure that they carry valid identity documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with unspecified gender (X) or documents that have been updated to the desired name and gender is different.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognise these documents is also very different.
In addition, investigations into security controls have become much more intrusive in the period after 11 September 2001.
Transgender people prior to their operation should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact when the scanners pass.
Riss currents are the returning current of waves broken on the beach, often at reefs or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper areas and a fast current up to deep water can form there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue in trying to swim back against the current, which can prove impossible.
When you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you won't get caught again. Alternatively, depending on your abilities and whether you've been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not so pronounced), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers, who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture, sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their culture of origin.
When you come home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to another culture and abandoned some of the behaviors of your home culture.
When you first travelled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers in a new country had to adapt.
It may not be expected that returning travelers will also need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and while it is quiet before the show starts.
Normally you always hear the sounds of tourists and sellers. The story of sounds and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, with the various pyramids being illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. By 2020 sixteen were active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula bounded by Lake Bellingshausen.
The mountains of the peninsula pass here into the plateau and then rise again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at an altitude of 4892 m.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, as you have to be outside and in the clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure ships, as well as expeditions that require data and voice connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information on the connection to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people who plan to take a year off are study and course offers abroad.
This is particularly popular with school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off from the university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participation in a foreign bridging year program can actually improve your chances of higher education in your home country.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged for the registration of these educational programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands – in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
For the archipelagos and lakes you do not need a yacht.
Even though the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually large enough for each yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, one in six or eight owns one boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most pure Baltic cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while you return in the evening and stay overnight on the ship.
If you only go ashore during the on-board excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises offer Berlin in Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and from every area of life, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
For this one does not have to be ashamed: This is nothing else than the personal fears and antipathies, which have a lot of people.
To learn more about the functioning of aircraft and the processes during a flight can help some to overcome the fear associated with the unknown or with the feeling of having no control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of things. Time is often a very important factor in business documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but other routes and smaller companies encountered difficulties.
When they sent things via air freight, unloading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to ship it as checked baggage. Airlines' regulations do not allow you to ship baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to add a big pile of money for the privilege (or, even better, get your own company to take over the costs).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to have to pay up to four times the normal economy rate for the business and eleven times for the first class!
In general, it is pointless to look for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of pilots who are ready to pay a lot of money and charge corresponding prices for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and conveniently.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinau. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova have been restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good traffic hub.
The former ancient town of Smyrna is today a modern, progressive and busy business center, located on a huge bay surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glazed buildings and modern shopping malls are characterized by classic red tile roofs, the 18th century market as well as old mosques and churches, although the city radiates an atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe rather than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons over some graves.
It is worth strolling through the fascinating village for half an hour.
To the north and in the immediate vicinity lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron had described their splendor in bright colors.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly via Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
Visit also in the north the great sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima, a place world famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are basically visiting a mass grave site and a place that is almost immeasurable for a significant proportion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who have survived their time here, and many others with relatives who were murdered or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, reverence and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not spoil the site by attaching or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
Most signs, however, are only given in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Normal announcements are made in the Metro exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen incidents are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be egocentric, rude and arrogant.
Even if this is often just an incorrect cliché, Paris is the best place to find your way around if you show yourself at its best and behave like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well educated), which will make it much easier to get it.
The barren appearance of the Parisians quickly disappears when you show basic manners.
The Plitwitz Lakes National Park is heavily wooded, there are mainly beech, spruce and fir trees and it offers a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, different soils and alternating altitudes, it has a remarkably large variety of plant societies.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and capercaillie as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach over their knees and also cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries there are changing skirts for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colours, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men have to wear trousers that reach over their knees.
Also these can be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. For all men there is a one size!
The Majorcan cuisine, like those in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any currently available ingredient such as cheese, tuna, etc.
"All nouns start in addition to the word "you" always with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence."
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It may also make reading easier, but writing is rather difficult because you have to determine whether a word of the word is used as the main word.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, as most of the words are spoken exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies according to the subsequent vowel.
"Take care to say r and rr differently: caro means "love", whereas carro means "speak car"."
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and to better understand formulations.
If you speak a Romance language, it is of course easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a little Spanish could quickly come to the conclusion that Portuguese is so similar that you don't have to learn it extra.
Pre-modern observatorys are usually no longer in operation and serve as museums or educational venues.
Since light pollution during its high phase did not pose the problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses that are easier to reach than those built in recent times.
Most modern research telescopes are vast facilities in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing the cherry blossoms, known as Hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other noblemen in the vicinity of the imperial court.
"Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove "just one" specimen."
If you visit a formal garden and collect 'samples', you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where you can find your way around and buy almost everything after your arrival.
Since you are in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, you have to expect both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, rarer).
There are also a few buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not only to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kirjat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
For example, castle tours in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They are also popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the festival were also adopted by nonbelievers in Christian and non - Christian countries all over the world.
There is the tradition of spending Easter night awake in some open spot to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
Traditional churches often hold an Easter night watch on Saturday evening, during the Easter weekend, and the celebrations of the churches often begin at midnight, celebrating the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or swimming.
Due to the large distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the trip, making the giant turtle the main grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first humans entered the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Light, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese working culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be used to.
Suits are part of common business clothing and colleagues address their family names or job designations.
The harmony in the workplace is crucial, with a focus on group performance rather than praise for individual achievements.
Employees often have to obtain the consent of their superiors for all decisions they make and they are expected to comply unconditionally with the instructions of their bosses.
