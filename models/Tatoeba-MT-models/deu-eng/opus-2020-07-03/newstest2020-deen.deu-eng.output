Fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The fire in a chemical plant in Rouen, France, which is considered to be particularly dangerous, has been extinguished. The prefecture of Normandy announced this on Friday. The fire broke out at night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with around 200 fire extinguishers.
The Fire could be stopped
Locals were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. Additives for lubricants are produced at the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine. The factory is part of the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people work at the plant. The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past - for example, when a leak ejected methane thiol in 2013 and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the waste water system of the city after an industrial accident.
Woman quits her job to look for 57 days after her missing bitch
For two months a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and for that she quit her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had escaped from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days were missing every trace of the bitch - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King told "Daily Inter Lake." She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they were going for dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had panicked dog
In the hope that Katie could still be in the hotel somewhere, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says: "She left about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls opposite "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie ran out immediately. Probably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. However, days have been weeks. "I have never given up. I have never lost hope," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake" who announced her job as a postal employee to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man called and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch stood under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King recalled, according to "Daily Inter Lake." "The tears were flowing. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and embraced us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found her."
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, September 27th, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases, its whereabouts are unclear. The opposition speaks of a "fearing" extent.
With the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition are disappearing again and again - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the force recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This is evident from a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, which is reported by the editorial network Germany.
According to the paper from the office of Secretary of State Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one part and 3474 rounds of ammunition have reappeared. The still missing weapons and parts of weapons are among others six machine guns of the type MG3, eleven guns of the type G3, four guns of the type G36, six signal guns and two pistols of the type P8. In addition, 30 gun tubes for machine guns of the type MG3 are missing.
The extent of weapons and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr is "anxious", said the left-wing member of the Bundestag, Martina Renner. This is all the more true since little has been found in the course of investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a "poor balance sheet". Renner criticized that the listing did not show whether the missing ammunition was also the one found in connection with the investigations against the suspected Bundeswehr officer Franco A. "Even though a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted of possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. According to ship observation data from Refinitive, the tanker started to move and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was designated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but at first it remained in Iranian waters. From the shipping company it was said that they wanted to wait for an official decision from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was raised on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz on charges of violating security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran responded to the controversial, temporary fixing of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar, which belongs to Britain.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important seaways in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil export is shipped through the straits. The tensions in the region had increased immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. Several incidents with tankers and drones have occurred.
Merkel Appreciates the Courage of People in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledged the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In autumn 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the former GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU faction on the upcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor reminded, among other things, of the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "State security was taken away from terror," she said.
Musk strives for delivery record
Tesla's quarter may have a record record. Despite the delivery boom, the electric car company has recently lost.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electricrek".
The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110000 orders, according to Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to get the cars to customers quickly. To do so, Tesla had to provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of trade with an increase of over six percent. The price hasn’t increased that much in almost four months. Tesla delivered a good 95000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. Six-digit figures are required for this in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but profit margins are low here. Despite the boom, there have been losses recently.
Mystery solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found out this with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress was also made on the question of why children are so fiercely fighting tickling, only to demand more.
Finally, it was also shown why only the approaching of a tickling hand triggers laughter even before the touch. This lies on a deep layer in the cerebrum, which triggers laughter already with the expectation of tickling.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with "Laughter" in the ultrasound range when tickled by humans. This "Laughter" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touching
So far it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-touching and contacting by others - that is, people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers found out in the experiments on rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during a self-touching. This is also the case when living beings clean themselves. During the foreign contact and tickling by the scientists, however, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh were intensified.
But if self-touching and contact by others happen at the same time, laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that the rat’s brain cannot distinguish between self-touching and contact by others. The new findings suggest that people cannot tickle themselves because self-touching activates a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. Thus, they sometimes broke off this initiation early in the experiment, showed flight behaviour or terror. This ambivalence is similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: large fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The fire in a chemical plant in Rouen, France, which is considered particularly dangerous, has been extinguished, and the prefecture of Normandy informed AFP on Friday that the fire had erupted on Thursday night.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances are said to have leaked. The samples taken give no cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with around 200 firefighting vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

Additives for lubricants are produced at the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine. The factory is part of the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements.
The chemical factory already made headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 the gas methane thiol escaped through a leak and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, about 2000 litres of mineral oil were fed into the city's wastewater system after an industrial accident.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by her own sister
The Prime Minister’s sister commented on Boris Johnson’s speech at the first session in Parliament after lifting the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister is threatening to lead the country without an EU agreement on 31 October should Brussels not agree to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, it is unclear how he intends to achieve this.
About Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and to reunite this country would be to leave the EU." Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the referendum campaign in 2016.
Memorial to Oslo and Utöya Attacks Revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honour of the victims will be unveiled on Saturday in Norway. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of around 1,000 iron rose replicas. They remind of the roses that thousands of people had left in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the cathedral in Oslo.
In the same place the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. Among others Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected to open.
On 22 July 2011, the law-terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first ignited a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and then shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp on the island of Utöya in the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party. In total, 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran frees British tankers
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran was able to sail again. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been detained in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, according to the shipping company Stena Bulk.
The "Stena Impero" had left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew are now going to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, said shipping manager Erik Hånell. At noon the ship left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he said to the Swedish TV channel SVT.
The Foreign Ministry in London described the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker on July 19 on charges that they had violated the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well according to the circumstances, said Hånell. They had behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and exhausting situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to bring them back together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in Gibraltar at the beginning of July when a supertanker with oil from Iran, which is said to have been destined for Syria, was put on the chain. According to the authorities, the delivery was in violation of EU sanctions against the war country Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the US.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. London vehemently rejected speculation that it was a trade in order to free the "Stena Impero".
The Strait of Hormus is one of the most important seaways in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world’s oil exports are shipped through the straits. The tensions in the region had increased immensely in recent months. Trade shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. Several incidents involving tankers and drones have occurred.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between both countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the US had unilaterally withdrawn from the international nuclear agreement, which was intended to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been putting massive economic sanctions against the country under pressure in Tehran to force a more stringent agreement extended to other areas. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign security forces, wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf with the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf.
With its protectionist economic policy, India is building a better future.
India would actually be predestined to be a "war winner." In view of America’s President Donald Trump’s punitive tariffs against Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People’s Republic are forced to re-dispose. Financial leaders of Asian companies considering moving their production from China to another country call India one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. This, of course, has not only to do with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have created a more important role in the globally widespread production chain.
But now India itself has become Trump’s focus. Derogating from the Haudegen in the White House as “Kingdom of Customs”, America has withdrawn the trade concessions for 2000 products from the emerging country at the beginning of June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and others more.
On the world map of the trade wars, the friction with India is, of course, just a side-show. America is also looking at the world’s largest democracy through its security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington are combining the concern about China’s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salve of American punitive tariffs against India is unlikely. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term, is therefore likely to weigh himself into safety.
The problem, however, lies in a different place: the empirically confirmed thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult situation in the socialist Republic of India. Also under Modi. His zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic insanity, which for too long suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state. Companies now receive faster building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more gripping insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the conditions for liquidating companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic perspective, much has turned to the better in India in the first five years of Modi. However, this does not apply in trade policy. The national conservative government even created new barriers to protect internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the West, Modi hangs on to the nimbus of the energetic reformer who radically renews his country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what vocabulary western managers like. In essence, however, the "India First" advocate never moved away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the isolation of their industries belong to the tribal voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and denounce this short-sighted policy.
The funeral of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
According to a report, the former French President Jacques Chirac is to be buried next week in Paris. The former head of state will be buried on Monday in the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, reported the news agency AFP, referring to the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the close family circle. A public funeral ceremony was scheduled for Sunday in Paris Invalidendom, according to media reports.
Bringing the competitor to the finish line: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
The top of the world was already in the finish line when warm scenes were taking place in the cooled-down Khalifa International Stadium. Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to wave dangerously in the first run of the men over 5000 meters. He could barely hold himself on his feet 300 meters before the finish line, ran in an unsightly bent position, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country Guinea-Bissau suddenly subdued him and dragged him to the finish line the last half of the stadium round. However, the forces were still sufficient for both of them to stop the watch running after the finish line. As if the scene had not already been curious enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unexpectedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists. Shy, he did not want to talk about his heroic feat at all. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he realized that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Cup by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances, he should not have even started. "That's why I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
This is what he did on the evening - and much more intensely than he would have thought. Because this feat will remain in memory. Zumal Dabo even let his competitor Busby take the lead in the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this preliminary race. In the end, it had done nothing, because the Busby, who only came to the finish with a lot of help, was disqualified at the end by the World Light Athletics Association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had started to set a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this succeeded with 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes". However, only in training, there are no best times.
Million-Mesh: Egyptians equip themselves for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up in the run-up to possible anti-government protests. In the centre of Cairo, there was an increased police presence on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around central Tahrir Square were closed.
In recent days, the police had intensified their roadside controls and partly searched pedestrian cell phones on news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, there had been protests with hundreds of participants against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s government, accusing the critic of corruption and mismanagement. Egypt had not had such an open protest against the political leadership for years. Egyptian builder and actor Mohammed Ali, who was living in exile in Spain, who was leading the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for a “million march” in central places in the country for today’s Friday. Ali calls for a “people’s revolution”. Although for most young Egyptians, the man is not a “good person” because he was a sub-contractor for the army, but his messages are coming.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to increase according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures could not be independently confirmed at first. The government also did not confirm and comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people had been "arbitrarily arrested," "just because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time," HRW reported, referring to lawyers arrested. According to their lawyers, the allegations against the arrested range from "dissemination of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association." In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces surveyed and searched in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, and also arbitrarily passersby according to HRW information.
HRW also criticised censorship in the North African country. According to this, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online Dealers: Mail order agents should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. About 20 million returns land on the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although companies could not be exempted from VAT on donations in kind, the Ministry explained to the Green Party on a question reported by the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe on Friday. However, traders could set the market value of unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay no or only a little VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that the citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany would return every sixth package when ordering on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - were subsequently shipped into the garbage. According to current legal situation, they would additionally cost the companies money, because the financial authorities evaluate donations in kind like a turnover, which then amounts to sales tax.
Green Group member Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on finance minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies cannot evaluate products for sale and donate them free of charge to non-profit organisations. Companies should be able to rely on not being punished for donations, which applies not only to online trade, but also to other businesses from fashion shops to the hardware store.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be auctioned off.
For Branczik, Banksy's work "emphasizes the regression of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude of animals and tribes." From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in the Bristol Museum in southwestern Britain in 2009, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had re-issued the painting, at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Time", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The picture could change ownership for a million dollars.
Most recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made a hard exchange with the opposition at the first session of the House of Commons following a forced break by the Supreme Court imposed by Johnson on Wednesday. Johnson wants to do the Brexit, which had already been postponed twice on 31 October, even if necessary without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in south-east England, he painted a picture depicting a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. Thousands of truck drivers and other visitors see the factory every day when they enter the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
According to his top advisor, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s violent verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a “walking in the park,” said Dominic Cummings at a book presentation on Friday. “We enjoy it. We will quit (from the EU) and we will win.”
Johnson had harshly attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days and accused them of "treasoning" the people, among other things. He dismissed as a "humbug" accusations that this could put Members in danger because they could become targets for murder threats.
Cummings said that the only way to return to peace was if MEPs finally respected the British' decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people were upset that the UK had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the Bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak to each other with respect," said one statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan’s Prime Minister Khan Calls for Uno Intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance at the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said at the UN General Debate in New York on Friday. "If this is going badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this."
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided Kashmir region. Both nuclear powers control one part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August India had withdrawn its autonomy status from the Indian Kashmir region and thus suddenly increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government reacts hard to the current protests in Egypt. It shoots at the population with sharp ammunition, more than 2000 arrested people join the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in prison. Protesting has never been safe in Egypt. However, since the takeover of power by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has been doing everything to avoid a scenario like the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drove millions to the streets. And that’s a problem that el-Sisi’s regime can’t handle, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who it finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the repression but also the biggest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was already the case before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. It becomes critical whenever large parts of the population have difficulty in buying a bottle of water at all.
Tüv checks in the terminal: BER-Chef: No more "showstoppers" for capital airport
Two months of testing was carried out to determine whether the complex system mesh works in combination with BER fire protection. Operators are satisfied with the process. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv inspections at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Chairman of the Supervisory Board Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completion of the test, but also said that there are still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we don't have a real showstopper." He assured that the timetable until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should not be too large any longer.The construction completion notice is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of defects in power cables have yet to be corrected; the Tüv wants to check them by February. "In order to create the conditions here for the start of flight operations, intensive work must continue to be done on the processing of the defects," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all dowels on which the cable lines hang. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the crossing to the station under the terminal is not yet working satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project three years ago into another crisis. This time it is about smoke aprons, which shut down in a fire like a screen so that the smoke does not spread. They drive too far down. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then there are to be new attempts with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. It was originally scheduled to go into operation in 2011. Since the start of construction in 2006, the costs have increased from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Because the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the responsible parties are planning to expand the airport. This is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board should take place on October 18, as the Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. CFO Heike Fölster will move to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Automats for drugs blown up - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and blew up a lot of vending machines in Chemnitz's city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines blown up in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply.
After two detonations at the end of May, the police caught a 33-year-old German on Bürgerstraße and Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the production of explosive explosions in the scene unit with a particularly serious case of theft, which was led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed."
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed eight acts in total.
The police spokesman: "He apparently financed his addiction to narcotics with the loot."The bomber alone blew up parking ticket machines on Bürgerstraße four times between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least EUR 60 000!
The vending machine bomber is now in custody and the police investigation against him continues.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further automatization in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is revamping its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price fight with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights departing from Vienna", confirmed a press spokesman from Austrian Airlines to APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported on this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa airliner Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. These will take over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations. Lines from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the speaker explained. The flight times will be coordinated with connecting flights. The aim is, on the one hand, to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other hand, to expand decentralised traffic from the federal states.
According to AviationNetOnline, Eurowings is serving in Vienna only as a "production company" for the group sister AUA. Among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. The on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants would come from Eurowings. According to the report, Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight number will no longer be handled in Terminal 1, but in the same way as the AUA in Terminal 3.
After the Niki bankruptcy, a prize fight broke out at Vienna Airport. Ryanair’s subsidiary Laudamotion announced on Thursday that next summer the fleet in Vienna would be increased to 16 aircraft. The Irish low-cost airline will send four Ryanair aircraft and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called “Wetlease”, which the union criticized as a bypass construct for the collective agreement.
On Friday, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's announcement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years' time answered AUA CEO Andreas Otto: "We will remain number one at the site, in five, six or ten years' time."
Queen-Enkelin Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four marries. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped for the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31) on the Italian holiday at the beginning of the month. The palace announced this on Thursday.
"We are extremely pleased to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can't wait to be married," the couple, who have been together since October 2018 according to British media reports, reported in the official announcement.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the coming years full of love and happiness".
Sister Eugenie snapped the pictures
The official engagement photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also published on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding is due to take place in 2020. More information about date, place and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
But it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British throne succession and the real estate mogul will be a similar celebration to the wedding of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really causes a heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genetic material of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the genetic material of 9000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of its kind in German-speaking countries, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. The Davos High Mountain Hospital, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved from Switzerland.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the main influencing risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not well known, it was said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genetic material of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at the UKE.
Currently more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known for possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations -, according to the hospital. Each year about 200 would be added.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in researching other common diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Centre. New insights into the interaction between the heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancers are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed the firm will to use the data to investigate other diseases. So far, the foundation’s clinic in Davos has mainly dealt with allergies. Now, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be established on the local medical campus and a professorship for bioinformatics is to be created. To justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he had been operated on at the open heart three years ago in Hamburg and was very grateful.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the Hamburg City Health Study. According to the hospital, this is the largest local health study in the world with 45,000 subjects. When it comes to genetic decoding, the scientists assured us that the anonymized data will be strictly protected. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, according to Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to the UKE, a human genome can be deciphered within 24 hours, with a mere cost of 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is expected to begin on 1 October, with all 9000 samples being analysed by the end of 2020. The following year, initial results are expected.
Nigerian police frees hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koranic school. According to evidence from local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some of the minor victims, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were abused. Some of them claimed to have been raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys were held on the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. In fact, the protégés were held by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhumane conditions," said Sabo. About a hundred pupils, including children aged nine, were chained up in a small room.
According to the information, the Koran School had existed for about ten years. Residents would have drawn the attention of the authorities to repeated irregularities in the institution. Parents would have been shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran School, said Sabo. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. The operator and six staff were arrested according to the police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled over the border to the neighbouring country Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and Tortured: Nigeria’s Police Release 400 Children from School
Police officers at a school in northern Nigeria released almost 400 students from appalling conditions. "Many of them were chained up and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
The children were discovered there on Thursday after an indication in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "unworthy of man". The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, had been held as slaves at their school and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television pictures showed poor and injured pupils in a clearly poor health condition.
World Football Election: Further accusations after Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Football Association awards the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. Lionel Messi is the sixth prize and thus the record.
After Nicaragua’s captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, accusations come from other countries to the FIFA. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious reason.
Many things at Fifa have proven to be objectionable in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans by its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Footballer Election has not yet been suspected of going unpunished - if one fails to see that the voting-right national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote in sympathy rather than objectively.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, there are further inconsistencies: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting summary.
Fifa apologized that "the signatures on the electoral forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid". The Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without reply.
Sudan’s Trainer Also Wondered
There is also an outcry about the election from Sudan. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese Association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote in the way it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in two and Sadio Mané in three. According to Fifa, however, the vote was received in the same way, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese Association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also raised accusations: "Don't vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my vote is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted in his name.
On Friday, the Federation announced that it was true, but of course it was not intentional. The completed electoral documents had been "mistakenly" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, according to a message from the Federation. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas had actually been elected. "We take responsibility for the administrative error", the message said. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "just as it is in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases have now been examined by Fifa, but it stresses that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world football competition - and Jürgen Klopp world coach of the year.
Ukraine affair: High-ranking Republicans call for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly advocated an official investigation against US president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said U.S. Republican Governor Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are being established." He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott Trump observed Biden "for years".
So far, the Republicans have held back with criticism of Trump over the whistleblower affair, and few have shown discomfort about it. Scott’s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already turned several times against Trump’s policies, such as the easing of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Another high-ranking Republican was Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governors of US states, have no formal say in the case against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. Nevertheless, first Republican senators have also made a critical statement about the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second parliamentary chamber, said the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing." US media also report that the Republicans had first internal cracks.
The affair could lead to the initiation of an impeachment procedure against Trump, while the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into it, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no exact timetable for the impeachment procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could exert a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on a real impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The chances of success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US president has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board Rackete's Sea Watch?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, reportedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had illegally driven the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Lybian refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious accusations against Rackete are being made. Thus, three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3". The suspects were arrested in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not have any reliable information ourselves," said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
The police reported in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered, namely Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - by repeated and constant physical violence," the communication said at the time.
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why the people flee Libya. Therefore, it is quite likely that the perpetrators are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed up."
Italy's right-wing former Minister of the Interior Matteo Salvini immediately requested an apology from Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aiding illegal immigration.
Musk sets delivery record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote to Tesla employees in an email published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, according to Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to get the cars to customers quickly. To do so, Tesla had to provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of trade with an increase of over six percent. The price hasn’t increased that much in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit figures are required for this in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but profit margins are low here. Despite the boom, there have been losses recently.
U.S. budget dispute: Once again just a bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in spending ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again without spending plans before the new fiscal year beginning on 1 October. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, a shutdown would have occurred on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump still has to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the Federal Administration will be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the 2019 financial year ending on Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 expenditure laws which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Administration cannot benefit for the time being from the expenditure framework extended for the new financial year from 1.3 bio. to 1.4 bio. $.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. However, the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are hardly capable of being majority.
In the Senate, Republicans seem to be trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the Wall, one of President Trump’s major priorities. Democrats are disrupting the construction of the Wall and its financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the Wall had already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the building of the wall the ghosts separate
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to get closer to each other on this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks, an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November will be possible.
Against the background of the Congress' continued inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated danger of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity. Template p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue the financing of the federal administration at the previous year's level, prohibiting the travel activities of parliamentarians and holding back their wages until the new annual spending plans were available.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilisation will also be open to women and lesbians living alone in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a government bill allowing all women to benefit from in vitro fertilisation, which is likely to increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations significantly.
The proposal still needs the consent of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that in the future many "children without a father" could grow up. The French Episcopal Conference is also opposed to the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which was defended by Health Minister Agnès Buzyn as a "chance" for society. It depicts the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the costs of artificial insemination for all women are to be borne by social security.
Insemination with semen of dead husband further forbidden
By a narrow majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment to give widows access to the semen of their dead husband for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination is permitted "post-mortem". In Germany, in the past, there were cases in which women in vain complained of the delivery of the semen of a deceased. Opponents of the initiative in Paris argued that such a begotten child would then bear a "particularly severe fate".
Many members of the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had opposed artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be subjected to a "double mourning" if her husband's death left her wish for a child unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can in future be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
Until now, artificial insemination in France is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot father children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - however, it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: calls for a flight tax for universities are getting louder
A lot is being flown at the universities. Therefore, the country wants to have a climate tax paid there in the future. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also limit themselves when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion on a climate levy on flights from universities and universities, which was postponed before the summer break, is once again in motion. After the country’s Rectors’ Conference had reacted sceptically to a corresponding push from the green-black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students from six universities in Baden-Württemberg and a Pedagogical College plead for compensation for service flights. This is the first step "urgently necessary", and at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidance of flights, according to their opinion. The cabinet decision, originally planned in July, is meanwhile still on ice, because the CDU has still not approved the Greens’ submission.
Russia once again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB intelligence service, the prisoners were reported to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time, there was a gunfire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. However, this time there were no casualties, they said.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. North Korean fishermen were therefore travelling in Russian territorial waters. According to Russia’s coast guard, patrols are carried out there to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 squid seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 squids were discovered and confiscated on the boats. Furthermore, according to the data, three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and transported to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia’s fishing authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there for some time this year, according to the media.
Georgi Martynov, head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, recently also complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. They also brought small organisms out of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed.
In the future, only 18.000: USA lowers asylum ceiling
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is shutting itself off from protection seekers: As the State Department in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees is being further lowered. In the future, especially threatened believers and Iraqis are to receive asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low threshold for the admission of new refugees again. In the marketing year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the US State Department explained. In the almost past marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the acceptance of protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, much higher admission limits had been applied.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980. Nevertheless, the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs described the U.S. as "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly recalls the language use of the incumbent U.S. president.
A "responsible approach" to refugees aims to allow refugees to return to their home countries in order to help rebuild their country, Trump explained. His hard course in migration policy gets a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to close off. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic policy developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure due to the Selenskyj affair and a potentially imminent impeachment proceedings.
According to the U.S. Foreign Office, the U.S. government intends to focus on the reception of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their beliefs - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, according to the State Department's statement. On the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be taken in from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The US wants to ensure that people from this "northern triangle" of Central America in particular apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States only signed migration agreements with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration at the US southern border to Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a reception station for apes in the USA at the request of the Argentine judicial authorities. Sandra, born in 1986 at the Rostock Zoo, was granted the rights of a "non-human person", so her release is imperative. The animal was taken to Dallas by direct flight on Thursday evening - not as a passenger, but in the cargo compartment, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram human monkey is unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, she is to live in the free enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida in the future. There are already 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", formerly a pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before moving into Florida, however, "Sandra" has to pass another 40-day quarantine at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before being transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" fundamental rights, which was initiated by animal conservationists in 2014, has contributed to the transformation of the zoo in Buenos Aires into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and education centre for the preservation of biodiversity will be established there.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme climber Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new hussar ride on the almost 3000-meter-high Great Peak in the Italian Alps.
Without net, double floor or other tools, the Swiss defeated the 550-meter-high North Face of the Great Peak in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute vertigo, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. Thus he undercut the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of Europe's six most important northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sporting goods manufacturer Nike recorded a significant profit increase, with net profit rising to 1.4 billion dollars in the past quarter (nearly 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor directly addresses its customers online.
Sales rose to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period until the end of August. Nike’s sales increased by 22 percent in China most strongly. Thus, the Beaverton Group in the US state of Oregon also benefited from its approach in the People’s Republic to direct itself directly to consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Head of finance Andy Campion announced that with strategic investments, Nike will continue to drive the "digital transformation" of the sporting goods manufacturer and thus increase its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased with the quarterly figures - the shares of the sporting goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban on racism in Italy
Due to racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital imposed a life-long ban on a fan. The Brazilian defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and called on his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud of being who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The club reacted late Thursday. He reported the fan’s account to Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma fan was never allowed to visit the club’s game again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against rival black players. "We cannot have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. One has to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums," Fifa President Gianni Infantino said on the weekend. The reason for the statement was racist chants at the first league match between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florence last Sunday.
But there had also been discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now imposed bans on 38 rioting fans of record champion Juventus Turin. Four of them are no longer allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed. Therefore, the rest are banned for four to seven years.
The fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus. Among other things, the twelve are accused of serious extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigation with an advertisement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are behind the black market with tickets. They would have "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and allegedly blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole vintages are considered with handy names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective lifestyle of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" With this reputation, crab fishing officially started on September 21 at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun, which also heralded the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee's Public Relations Department.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal ecological conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun started to breed crabs already in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a formative industry that has provided high incomes and has become an important part of Gaochun’s economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has been actively engaged in a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming as well as in technology-based crab farming. And the city has taken care of promoting greater efficiency in agriculture and farmers’ incomes.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform to "distribution of power, optimization of administration and government services" and carefully established the service network for "authorizations under one roof, a law enforcement team, a network for services, a platform for lending" to fully optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the local benefits of connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as a signpost to establish smart high-end production facilities, biomedicine and medical companies, energy storage and environmental protection, cultural and health industries, and organic farming companies that are leaders in the "3+2" sector. At the same time, Gaochun has actively developed the development of a national tourism zone covering all areas and tourist sites of national importance, including the environmental and cultural resources of the Gaochun countryside, the state of buildings for civic services and public services, the areas of tourism +" and "+ tourism" and the development of cultural tourism at a high quality level. It is worthwhile to look forward to the future of Gaochun.
Iran-US conflict: Ruhani talks about the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after his return from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged offer by the US to lift sanctions. In return, the United States had promised to end all sanctions in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, Ruhani stated on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted Iran’s counterpart on Twitter: “I wanted Iran to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no.”
Ruhani describes the events as follows: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and urged that a meeting be held. "And America says that I am lifting the sanctions," added Ruhani. The nature of the sanctions that were to be ended had been a subject of debate. "And they have clearly said that we are lifting all the sanctions."
However, this move had not been carried out in an acceptable manner, Ruhani criticized. In view of the current punitive measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear deal negotiated with Russia and China with Iran, which is to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet with US President Donald Trump on the margins of the UN General Assembly.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After two earthquakes struck western Turkey in a very short time, the fear of a catastrophe is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This increases the concern about a catastrophe.
Fourteen schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, and hundreds of buildings were damaged. On Thursday, the 5,8th earthquake shook the Marmara region off Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions. Oktay announced that the government would now set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future.
Over the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is ignored again and again. Every year, badly built houses collapse - among other things, the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shock Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces, which have been registered as refuges in the center, have long been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August had the Istanbul Civil Engineering Chamber warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul are not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the Thursday quake was in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometres, as reported by the civil protection authority Afad. A minor aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that injured or damaged were not reported at first. TRT showed people running out of their homes in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings for security reasons in the Silivri district. Some students wept, as can be seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly at risk of earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian earth plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly quake in 1999 was near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. However, it is unclear when the earthquake will occur. In the earthquake on Thursday it hit again the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags packed with everything needed ready to stand beside front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth shakes. When the next big quake comes, it is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom), according to which two minarets of mosques collapsed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning for aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. Buildings wobbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than Tuesday’s, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned of aftershocks via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official data, the time of the quake is 1:59 p.m. (local time). Only a few minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a postquake with a strength of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it could be felt until Istanbul. Its epicenter had also been located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the civil protection authority Afad informed already on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually unload - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It has become more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a larger earthquake," Ersoy said to the transmitter. "In the past or later the big quake will also come."
Already a few weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake also caused great concern in Istanbul. In Albania there had also only been a violent earthquake a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also at Lake Constance the earth had been shaking this year.
Parliament: New ignition fuel in Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents provide for new explosives in the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment procedure, the US Democrats are encouraged: The complaint about Trump filed by an anonymous whistleblower and his controversial telephone call with the Ukrainian President provides important clues for investigations against the President. Trump himself once again sees himself as a victim of a "witch hunt". He also questioned the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: Passengers of United Airlines locked in toilet - pilot redirected
Because a passenger was detained in the board toilet, a flight was diverted by United Airlines. The toilet door was blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline reported according to the US media.
On Wednesday night (local time) during an off schedule stopover in Denver, the woman was finally released from the tight cabin. She had been detained in it for about an hour, U.S. media wrote invoking other passengers. Passengers had to change the aircraft to continue their flight to San Francisco.
In a video distributed on the Internet, which according to the U.S. media is supposed to come from flight 1554, you can see how several people are trying to free the woman. "We're currently working on opening the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline apologized to all passengers. Initially it was open whether the woman was getting compensation.
The cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation", British success author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27th, according to Diogenes Verlag (Zurich). It concerns the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but is now the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people and is determined to let nothing and nobody stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If Parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders once, if Brexiteers in high positions almost implore the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to this: write." McEwan had only appeared in the spring of the novel "Machines Like Me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafka's first story, published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "transformed into an enormous vermin," gradually being excluded from family and society, and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that is upside down," said Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria’s rail infrastructure
11.200 Wagons in Austria and Hungary receive whisper brakes to reduce noise pollution from freight trains. In addition, sections of the railway links between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernized and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions.The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travels cancelled until 31st October
The German tour operator Thomas Cook canceled all travels until 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency application. Travels could not be started "for reasons of insolvency", the company informed on Thursday evening.
Bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which are already paid for or fully paid for, are also affected. The company left open the way to travel starting on 1 November 2019. In coordination with insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into bankruptcy of the British parent company and had filed an insolvency application on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer money back to hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday onwards, hotels abroad, which are currently hosting Thomas Cook holidaymakers, will receive money from Zurich Insurance. According to Zurich, payments to hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer required to make extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without presentation of separate invoices, the hotels in the holiday resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and provided that Thomas Cook travelers are not immediately asked or otherwise required to pay hotel invoices by these hotels", said Spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The insurance company responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay their own accommodation on site, so some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federation of Consumer Centres had strongly criticised this.
How many hotels are affected will be coordinated with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, said the insurance spokesman. According to information from Thursday, 70 000 Thomas Cook holidaymakers from Germany were on the road. Zurich Germany has secured holiday and return travel of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and to find a future solution.
However, the now announced payouts to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help travellers who are still on the road. Thomas Cook customers, who still want to fly on holiday, look bad. On late Thursday evening, the company announced that all travels until 31 October inclusive would be cancelled. This also applies to bookings that have already been paid.
The company left open the way to travel starting on 1 November 2019. In coordination with insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it said. In principle, the insurance company Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travels has stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about possibilities of refunding the travel price and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys mine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued the engagement of Lady Diana. In Africa, he is now directly following the footsteps of his mother.
In Angola, British Prince Harry set fire to an explosive mine and destroyed it.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near Dirico, he produced the ignition circuit on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosive device exploded in the savannah landscape without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry then wanted to walk directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in Huambo City. With the same blastmaster who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to travel the way she was going back then. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She too had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, starting in Cape Town, South Africa's tourist metropolis.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that he would not guarantee a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations, but what statements have been made in the polarizing British for a long time. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in the UK hovers like a Damocles sword over the Blond Schopf. His suspension of the parliament in order to be able to stubbornly carry out its Brexit course until the date of departure was cancelled earlier this week. And a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to effect an extension of the bilateral talks in the event of failed negotiations with the EU by 31 October. However, Johnson categorically excluded this again and again.
Boris Johnson still thinks deal is possible
But the pressure does not seem to pass by Johnson either. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he suggested that he would support an extension of the negotiations in the event of a non-agreement until the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is running out for Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators have about six weeks left to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement, but the recent talks have again failed to achieve a breakthrough. An agreement until the end of October seems difficult to imagine at the moment. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a further postponement of the exit date is in force. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister’s words. She fears that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
U.S. authorities: Further deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of e-cigarettes in the US has risen to 12. Moreover, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this context, the US health authority CDC informed. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine" there were already more than 900 affected, about 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. No similar increase in lung damage is known in Europe so far. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the US.
Fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Mohammed Ali’s videos have been shared millions of times in online networks, with the Spanish building contractor and actor calling for a “people’s revolution” and calling for further protests today against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali is hoping for mass demonstrations with one million participants in the country’s central squares.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. In the centre of Cairo there was already an increased police presence. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were blocked. Already in recent days the police had intensified their road controls and partly searched the mobile phones of pedestrians on news and photos in connection with the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had been no such open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted harshly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) nearly 2000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them were arbitrarily arrested - just because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW reported, referring to lawyers arrested.
The organization also criticised censorship in the North African country. According to this, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after overthrowing democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of the government, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially sentenced in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fox of Greenland Expedition back
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition. On his arrival at the port of Hamburg he was greeted by the skipper Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thunberg with the racing yacht "Malizia" across the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar researcher. He had waited for years for the young generation to speak up. One knows for decades that the earth is warming up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often happens to the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the waste of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, a drone of Greenlandic glacier ice was surveyed and nets were fished for microplastics, they said.
The polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" for his "struggle for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans" at the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness of the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades."
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: that seemed to two Japanese tourists too much. The bill with 80 euros tip included was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which caused heated reactions.
"Such cases harm Rome's reputation. We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," demanded a spokesman of Federagit, the Federation of Travel Guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The restaurant owners promptly responded. Japanese women had ordered not only spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this cannot be seen from the invoice. Also a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, the innkeeper said.
A phone call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with an impeachment procedure after the turbulent revelations of recent days, the Democrats now want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the talk is about weeks before a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj. The accusation of the whistleblower, who finally brought the conversation out of concern for the national security and for the democracy of the USA with his complaint to the public, is monstrous: The president misused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the election 2020. He used the dependence of Ukraine in the process of blackmailing and thus wanted to force them to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be traced in the meanwhile published transcript of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reproduce the full text. However, the phone call of 25 July is only an episode of a much larger story, in which the focus, alongside Trump, is primarily his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public's point of view, the story begins in May 2019 when the New York Times reports on Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet with President Selenskyy in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We don't interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation of what we have the right to do," he says to the newspaper. One might think that it is inappropriate, but "there is nothing illegal about it." Giuliani wants investigations to be pursued in Ukraine, for which there is hardly any basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and could prove to be helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former mayor of New York seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies, which are fixed on Trump's rival candidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, to construct a reason for the Russia investigations in the US. However, this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
The issue is precisely the investigation that Trump will talk about on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giulianis and the President reads: former Vice President and currently prospective candidate for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, as Ukraine Commissioner of the Obama administration, has urged the dismissal of the then Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Schokin, in order to stop the investigation of the gas company on whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden worked. Biden senior has financially extorted Ukraine to cover up the corrupt machinations of his family.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General go, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin was also accused of deeply corrupt conduct himself, the US government was by far not the only Western partner pushing for his dismissal. Moreover, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Interference with Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions on Instagram and Facebook. According to this, Germany, the UK and Spain are particularly affected. On the website allerunterstörungen.de users report that Facebook has not been loading since about 3.30 p.m. again and again. Instagram also gives the error message that content could not be loaded. Also Whatsapp seems to be affected by the disturbance, although not to the same extent so far.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by interference
It is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services had been cancelled for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also use Twitter to make their anger clear.
Polish scientists saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued from the Antarctic ice by the Chilean Air Force. They were on the way with a rubber boat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for the rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we got the news, just before ten we started, and 20 minutes later we were over the dinghy".
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, and 19 scientists work there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NEVER wirelessly charge
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should still not be used.
Since recently several new smartphones have come onto the market, which support wireless charging and sell themselves very well - above all the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. However, even if the smartphone is perfectly aligned on the charging pad, the researchers have always measured more than 30 degrees. If the mobile phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad increases, which in turn drives the power consumption up.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but also does not last so long overall. The service life is therefore lower. Therefore, the researchers advise that the smartphone should always be charged by cable. Since a battery exchange is always associated with high costs for modern smartphones, this might be a helpful tip. Apple has recently even increased the cost of a battery exchange once more - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and tedious plug-fumbling. Since Qi (which stands for inductive energy transmission) is a worldwide standard, in which exceptionally even Apple participates, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest Stau photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
According to a Nepalese climber, he climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and set a record, his expedition operator informed.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: from him comes a photo of climbers who are lining up on Mount Everest, which went viral in spring.
The image of the mass crowd triggered a debate about stronger safety measures on the 8848-meter-high mountain and the highest peak of the earth. In May, eleven climbers had died during the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. One reason for this is called bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to enable it to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman announced on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
Almost 200 elephants are killed every year in Sri Lanka. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously been harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This is usually the case when the animals move through villages built close to their habitat.
In Sri Lanka, it is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants are still alive.
Holden British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its settlement by Iran. This was announced by the shipping office Bandar Abbas according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had imposed the British flag tanker on July 19 on charges of disregarding the regulations of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in Criticism
The House of Commons Economic Committee in charge wants to investigate the bankruptcy of travel giant Thomas Cook in a comprehensive manner. It is about the salary packages of the board of directors as well as the question why the British government did not like to contribute financially to the company struggling for survival. "Our interest is the supervision in the company as well as the control by external accountants," stated committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London. "It is obvious that we are dealing with a bad example of management greed."
According to experts, genes are overestimated at the risk of colon cancer
The role of genes in the family-related increased risk of colon cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a recent study. Therefore, other risk factors such as family-related eating habits probably weigh heavier than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of colon cancer, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk Raises Tesla Shares
Musk wrote this to Tesla employees in an e-mail published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". Demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it went on in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge was to get the cars to customers quickly. To achieve this, Tesla had to provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of trade with an increase of over six percent. The price has not increased that much in almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered more than 95'000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. Six-digit figures are required for this in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but profit margins are low here. Despite the boom, there have been losses recently.
Will British government bypass Brexit law? Johnson restrained
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping his mind on whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the law against unregulated Brexit, which was recently passed by Parliament. On a question like this, he merely told journalists on Friday that his government would abide by the law.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the date of withdrawal should no agreement be reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law until after the EU exit.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is through an agreement."
Iran apparently ramps up uranium enrichment
Iran’s President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. “Unfortunately, European states show inability or unwillingness to take concrete action,” Rohani said at a press conference on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday. In the event that they were not in line with their promises, he envisaged “further steps” away from the agreements of the laboriously negotiated 2015 agreement.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained the promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the US unilaterally withdrew from the agreement to force Iran to change its course in what is considered aggressive Middle East policy with "maximum pressure". President Donald Trump's government wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now again relying on harsh sanctions against Tehran. Iran responded to this last time with a resurgence of the limited uranium enrichment in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now also used or prepared for use the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing the construction of more than 300 additional centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans were not prepared to bear their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and burden of pressing US sanctions, Rohani speculated. However, there would still be further talks, which hopefully would provide a solution.
Rohani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia, the situation changed in mid-September: Germany, France and Great Britain followed on Monday the US estimate that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iranian-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen had committed the attack, but this was considered a false commitment by the US. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this," said Rohani. However, the European leaders could not have done this in the talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they would only have called for the rebels in Yemen not to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, France’s President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, Rohani demanded that the far-reaching sanctions imposed by the US administration be lifted. He called on the government in Washington to turn to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet of other star crosses solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This was first achieved. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized after its discoverer on 2I/Borisov and aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The widely travelled comet had been discovered on August 30th by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Observations of various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not come from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is after 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017 only the second interstellar object, which was sighted during a flight through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to gain close insights into a foreign solar system before disappearing on never-seeing. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. "The current velocity of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which at this distance is well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the Sun," reported Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Agency Nasa in a communication.
According to the analysis, the comet is travelling on a so-called hyperbolic orbit that leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was initially listed under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, was given the designation 2I/Borisov, the first part of which indicates that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been sighted in the approach. This leaves researchers with many months to study. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "After that, it will only be visible with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the sky object for 2 to 16 kilometres in a first study. Images of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already acquired a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles those of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could be shaped by similar processes as our colleague Javier Licandro, added de León.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests, according to the IAU, that these objects could open a new way of researching certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how often such tipping visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission of the European space agency Esa.
Until 2028, the agency intends to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (German for example comet interceptor) on a waiting position at a distance of 1.5 million kilometres from Earth. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it should either lurk on a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
On time before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic of China, it's time: On the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger aircraft of the China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are scheduled to be handled annually at the new airport, and 72 million by 2025. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China’s latest prestige project is also called the “starfish” because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which are to be expanded later to seven, and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly said that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, has been postponed again and again. In Beijing, however, a first passenger plane landed already after four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: from London to Sydney in four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - this is what the British space agency UK Space Agency dreams of. To make possible this supersonic-speed flight (Synergic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire is developing, the US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely accomplish this," said agency chief Graham Turnock to the station. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British space agency wants to work more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport to date, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 to the end of its operation in 2003, taking between three and three and a half hours. In 2000, there was an accident at the start of a Concorde at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, where all 109 passengers were killed. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft together with the US space agency Nasa, the "X-Plane". Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," Reaction Engines writes on his homepage, among other things. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation of truly reusable cream travel equipment".
Riot in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about the US President's possible abuse of power, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," Trump said on Thursday in front of the U.S. embassy staff at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and in the past they were treated "a little differently" than they are today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate tippers. The event was actually not public, but several US media broadcast audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the president’s statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives had announced preparations for an impeachment trial against Trump on Tuesday. Their accusations are mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who makes serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. The descriptions of the whistleblower had been made public on Thursday following great public pressure.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to have received information from several government officials that the US president "uses the power of his office" to get another country involved in the U.S. 2020 election in his favor.
At the heart of the accusations is a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This concerns former business of Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from Ukrainian justice. Biden is in the lead in the race for democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up in view of Ukraine’s telephone call: leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under wraps. As usual, an electronic text protocol had been made. However, this had been removed from a database that was usually intended for this purpose after the discussion by White House lawyers, and instead was stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough talk protocol has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not known to the public. The New York Times reported that it was an employee of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the so-called whistleblower had spread information from second hand, which had turned out to be incorrect. Therefore, perhaps there were no tippers or spies at all.
However, as Trump expressed himself in New York about those who were supposed to have leaked information to the Whistleblower, outrage was unleashed. Nancy Pelosi, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives, reacted with concern and lamented that Trump’s statement once again undermines the integrity of the government.
Various investigations against Trump and his surroundings have been going on in the House of Representatives for months now in various committees. In view of Ukraine’s allegations, the Democrats are now pushing forward investigations with new force in order to initiate a possible impeachment procedure against Trump.
"The whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation," said Adam Schiff, head of the Secret Service Committee in the House of Representatives. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accused him of misrepresenting things and again demanded the resignation of the chairman of the committee. Trump regularly insulted Schiff and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. officials from the security and foreign affairs sectors, most of whom were under democratic but also Republican presidents, stood behind the investigation initiated by the Democrats on Friday for a possible impeachment procedure. If the allegations were to prove true, this would be "an unscrupulous abuse of power" by Trump, it said.
There is no exact timetable for the further procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on a real impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The chances of success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US president has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Works Council: Workplaces are "slowly" dismantled
The VW brand’s plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the works council of the car manufacturer. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by two billion euros from ten billion euros to 2023. Of this, 500 million euros are to be saved already this year.
The "Future Pact" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be reduced by the car manufacturer if it is demonstrated that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security is valid until 2029.
However, as our newspaper learned from the works council circles, jobs in production, which are not really ready, are "slowly" dismantled by another way - i.e. by the official course. Thus, regular jobs that become vacant are often not reoccupied.
In these cases, the works council had no possibility to force the re-occupation. Meanwhile, in many places, personnel were lacking, the work compression increased, the worries about a gradual bleeding out of the vehicle plants would become greater. Thus, the fear also increases that the vehicle production could be gradually withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. VW only said: "An adjustment of the employment volume takes place as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and manage new projects centrally. This is also intended to reduce costs and speed up decisions – the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. At a manager conference in Berlin, Andreas Tostmann, Chief Production Officer, said: "In uncertain times, from Brexit to the impending trade war between the US and China, we are well advised to make ourselves resilient to the crisis."
There are already successes along this path: for example, this year for the first time since 2013 the production costs per vehicle would decrease compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exactly figures on the production time are not mentioned by VW, according to information from our newspaper, it is around 7 in the Golf 7
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg factory is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants produce components. For Wolfsburg, VW's internal rule of thumb is that 800,000 cars have to be built there every year in order for the plant to be satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, the capacity utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the falling demand for diesel and the problems with the conversion to the new WLTP fuel consumption and exhaust gas test method.
As Production Director Tostmann announced last year, however, one million cars are expected to roll off the conveyor belt in Wolfsburg "perspectively". This is supposed to make the bundling of the golf production in the parent plant possible - because the Zwickau plant will hand over the golf production through the conversion to the location for e-car production.
In addition, the SUVs Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on Golf 8. Despite all efforts to build up e-mobility, it should remain the bread and butter car of Wolfsburg for the time being.
Forced to Prostitution with Voodoo: Traffickers Sentenced
Young women from Nigeria have taken oaths, been smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six alleged human traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six alleged human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and prison sentences of up to eight years and three months on Friday in Bochum. The defendants had sent young women from Nigeria to the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerian women who wanted to leave had to make a ritual vow in front of a Voodoo priest in their home country.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in dinghy boats. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. Arrived in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels in order to work off the alleged sluice costs of an average of 25 000 euros.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the smuggling and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women to brothels in the trial. "The work made the women physically and psychologically difficult to do," said judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. "Some were really disgusted."
The verdicts are in the form of industrial and gang smuggling of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIn the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendants union Ufo has once again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union "will inform on 14 October about the industrial action measures in the LH Group", said Ufo tariff board member Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with the Ufo for months. This also concerns the question of whether the union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, UFO now sees itself strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to state that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined to appeal against it. "I consider that a second court sees the matter completely different, I consider unlikely," said Ufo board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Frankfurt Regional Labour Court to have the status of UFO as a trade union reviewed in court.The company argues that the union has not set up an authorised board of directors for months and is therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the branch union, during which numerous members of the board and the advisory board resigned, including the long-standing trade union leader Nicoley Baublies. Due to doubts about their leadership, Ufo had suspended a preliminary vote on strikes by cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July.
Facilitated Entry: Saudi Arabia Announces New Visa System
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but this is to change now. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia intends to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the tourism commission stated that it wanted to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, Chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult for tourists to access. Visas are usually given only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the ErzkonservativeKingdom hopes for more income from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churai oilfield. In the aftermath, national oil production drastically collapsed, oil prices shot high. It is expected that it will take several weeks for the Kingdom’s oil production to return to its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for wedding feast
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in her Instagram stories on Thursday (local time) where she can be seen in a white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelor party in Los Angeles according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful suits printed with bananas on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to get married churchly next weekend.
A year ago, the Biebers gave themselves the "yes" word in a New York registry office. There had not been a major celebration at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that after initial problems, the two would have found a common level: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck had been discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metschin), the police reported. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening, after the crew had sent an emergency signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also in use during the search. The cause of the accident still has to be determined. The crash site lies about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also causes of the threat, the World Conservation Union IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. It examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them are not found on any other continent. Of these 265 are threatened 58 per cent. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and therefore before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "at risk", "strongly endangered", "at risk of extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
Eberesches and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) is particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, of the German Press Agency. "Most of them are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They have been considered "at risk" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. Next to a fungus, the biggest threat is the Balkan miner moth. It has spread from Southeast Europe over the whole continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 specimens. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Shrub species and mosses also in danger
The IUCN scientists also produced new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and moss. More than a fifth of moss and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and were an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. "We must limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority".
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 injured reported
34 people were injured in the recent earthquake in Turkey. According to the figures, there were no deaths. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged. Since the quake the previous day there had been almost 200 aftershocks. The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 on Thursday shook the Marmara region off Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. In the past 20 years Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly at risk of earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance that marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian earth plates.
One of the heaviest quakes was one of the magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was in Gölcük, southeast of Istanbul at that time. More than 17,000 people were killed.
Already on Tuesday, a quake of 4.6 shook the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the half-time show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the mid-term show of the next American football final Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers on Twitter. "It won't be any bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She was very excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had been dreaming of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at that time she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special, because the NFL lasts 100 years and I will perform with another Latina." She could hardly wait to "show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world".
Shakira pointed out in an explanation that she was honoured to be on one of the biggest stages in the world alongside another artist and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "queen" were on a stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining audiences
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the USA. Even though you have recently dropped audience numbers: This February, the spectacle attracted the fewest viewers in the US for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
In the run-up to the mid-term show of the previous Super Bowl, there had been turmoil: In the dispute over dealing with Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform last February according to media reports. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the mid-term show - the reviews were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had kneed in front of NFL games in the National Anthem in 2016/17 in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, U.S. President Donald Trump attacked the mostly African-American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been disunited since March 2017 and has no longer fought NFL-partie. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, some banks are likely to find the failure of travel provider Thomas Cook expensive. High depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans is threatening. Credit Suisse is also affected by this, writes the "Financial Times" in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit and Credit Suisse would probably have to write down up to £1.8 billion (about €2 billion) on their books, according to the report, which would have shown estimates by the consulting firm AlixPartners.
The creditors of bonds would have to accept write-downs of between 900 million and 1 billion pounds and lenders of between 550 and 825 million pounds. The amounts actually to be written off are likely to be at the upper end of the range, one expert told the paper.
The extent of the losses of the creditors in the end will become apparent after the insolvency proceedings have ended. A person close to this procedure did not give too much hope. For example, Thomas Cook’s 40 or so aircraft were “old” in the UK and many of the properties were in bad locations. The most money could probably be taken out by selling the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand, it went on to say.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't rule this out, but we don't have any reliable information ourselves," said the spokesman of the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, of the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They were accused of rape, torture and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators had been arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organisations could not check who they had sent to their ships. "They come without passports."
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29th and had rammed a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day the three suspects arrived there as well. The captain is under investigation for aiding illegal immigration.
USA warn federal government against Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government not to trust the Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe the risks are too great," Pai told the "Handelsblatt" regarding the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" which obliges every company "under Chinese jurisprudence" to follow instructions from the security bodies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," the FCC CEO added. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to require suppliers to provide a "declaration of trust".
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" on the basis of its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology is not just hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," Pai said.
It would be "very difficult to imagine" that a government agency, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership is opaque, and the employee company, which allegedly owns the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told the "Handelsblatt".
The U.S. would have learned that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the position of the U.S.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: schools closed
At night local residents hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky above a northern French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the clean-up work could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French town of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not be opened as a precautionary measure on Friday, the relevant prefecture informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not expose themselves to smoke. There were no injured. Farmers and breeders were called upon to bring their animals inside, to protect their food and to stop harvesting for the time being.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still a risk that smells will spread after the deletion, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture 240 firefighters as well as 90 police officers and gendarmes were in action at the fire village.
A gigantic black smoke column had risen from the chemical factory before. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the Lubrizol factory, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city centre.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored. In 1976, a devastating chemical accident had occurred in Seveso, Milan, Italy.
The prefect of Normandy, Pierre-André Durand, told the news station BFMTV that no "high toxicity" had been detected in samples at first. However, pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river dams had been built up against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 2:40 p.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest and now"
The French Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest, and now, the sooner the better," said Le Maire at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year on Thursday evening.
The economy in the eurozone is faltering, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens in order to make the necessary decisions".
Le Maire said that action would have to be taken by those countries that have budgetary leeway for more investment, including Germany.
France does not have these leeway, the minister added, pointing to his country's high public debt, which is more than 98 percent of its gross domestic product. French public debt must be "stabilised" and "settled," said Le Maire.
In recent years, appeals have repeatedly come from France to Germany to make more public investments in order to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to control its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
Among other things, the French government is reacting to the protests of the yellow vest movement. New debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick him?: Johnson gives way to question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises the "capitulation law" passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law prescribes the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos brexit. Critics fear, however, that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. Referring to this possibility, however, the Tory politician deviates.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping a lid on whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the law recently passed by Parliament, which is exactly what is supposed to prevent it. Johnson merely told journalists that his government would abide by the law.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the date of withdrawal should no agreement be reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law until after the EU exit. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31st, and the best way is by agreement."
Johnson's chief consultant Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, stated that he felt that the political conflicts surrounding Brexit were a "walking in the park" and was confident that the intended exit from the EU would still be achieved: "We will enjoy this, we will win, we will quit (note: from the EU), don't worry," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" at a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the election campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, now serves as the chief strategist in the British government headquarters of Downing Street. He is said to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister into an almost hopeless situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) plunges deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the illustrated book "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrious guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as a committed artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film."
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona, until she found her way to photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, a few hundred of them are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course there is always one in the center: her husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
There he dances on his shoulders with his daughter Mary, telephones in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboats. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the spotlight on their farm in southern England or Scotland also led a very normal life. Thus, according to the BBC, Mary McCartney said that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had made from old potato boxes. And tidy it hasn’t always been with the McCartneys either.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decision click: you have to realize if a great photo happens before you. And then you have to snap it at the exact right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you snap two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift to always capture the exact right moment. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in the Eshun essay.
That's where the light, the composition, the cut-out and the colours are right, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure in addition to all the anecdotes, where landscapes also seem to be abstract paintings.The perfect addition to the recently reissued Beatles album "Abbey Road", which was released exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from its neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot stop importing oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he participated in the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had "rescinded due to US threats."
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and is not complying with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably.
US government wants to restrict reception of refugees
On Thursday, the US State Department stated that the annual ceiling of a resettlement programme should be lowered from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, equivalent to an average of 40 percent.
The State Department said that while the US would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, the most important task was to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overloaded.
The US government intends to focus in future on the reception of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their beliefs - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, as stated in the State Department's statement. On the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be taken in from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The programme, launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps all over the world and resettles them in the US. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the programme’s history. Even the current upper limit of 30,000 is a low. When US President Donald Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama left the White House, the number was almost 85,000.
Aid organizations reacted appalledly to the announced lowering of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The US would thus continue to damage its leadership in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the US, both legally and illegally. According to the US government, 350,000 asylum applications are expected for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Come close to a snitch"
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage. Whoever has given the informant who accuses him of abuse of power "comes close to a snitch," Trump said, according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. This is reported by several U.S. media in agreement.
So Trump spoke to the staff of the American UN mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, "This comes close to a snitch." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayals, we used to deal with it a bit differently than we do now."
Observers rated the latter remark as a possible allusion to the death penalty. Democrats strongly criticized Trump’s statements and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. It was also an attempt to hinder a congress investigation into a possible impeachment procedure against him, wrote the chairmen of the committees for foreign affairs, intelligence services and oversight in the House of Representatives.
In a complaint now published, the Whistleblower accuses the president of having abused his office in order to request an intervention by another country in the U.S. election 2020. Specifically, his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation Trump advised him to initiate investigations against his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any misconduct.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower himself and his informant are. However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat capsized: baby and toddlers drown in Aegean
Again and again people try to come from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea. The often too small boats are regularly capsized. Seven migrants have now died in the sinking of a inflatable boat - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios seven migrants were killed in the sinking of a inflatable boat. Among the fatalities were also a baby and four other children, the Greek coast guard reported. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be saved from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is said to be also a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Currently hundreds of migrants from Turkey are moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in too small boats. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The Who cancel concert
A U.S. concert by the rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end due to an invisibility of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed service. In the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience, "I think I should let it go while it's still running."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for an apology and added that Daltrey "can't really talk now." Townsend promised the audience that he would get his money's worth at a compensation concert. However, an appointment is not yet set.
For Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver scheduled performances canceled The Who. They are to be made up at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from a small startup to a driving force in the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords have to fear billions of dollars in revenue.
The crisis of the office rental company WeWork threatens to disturb the balance in the largest real estate markets in the world. A few days ago, the company had sold founder Adam Neumann as boss, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for the executives in order to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British "Financial Times" reports that WeWork has stopped the completion of new leases with immediate effect. Thus, among other things, in New York and London, the largest tenant of office space is suddenly out of the market.
WeWork rents large office space over the long term and leases it to members in small units at short notice. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. Up to now, WeWork burns money at a breathtaking speed with this business. Last year, the company made a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year, the rental costs alone are said to have increased to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars through the rental of new large areas. In order to limit the loss, the new management is now said to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped the rental of new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now entered into leases with terms of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion, which could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented nearly 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months. WeWork’s new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new areas that came onto the market at that time. Without WeWork’s expansion, the office vacancy in the U.S. metropolis would have risen during this time, as Alpert wrote in the “Business Insider”. Similarly, in London, WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in the best location.
Even in the British capital, the balance on the real estate market could be noticeably shifting without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis, which was bought last year by Sparkassen fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have converted their properties to meet the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off a portion of the expected billions of revenues. They do not have access to the - anyway scarce - reserves of WeWork despite the long-term rental contracts. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork usually takes place by each of the subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.
Russia once again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of 262 poachers who had illegally fished in the waters have been arrested, according to the Russian national intelligence service FSB of the Interfax agency on Friday.
Only ten days ago 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no casualties, they said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore travelling in Russian territorial waters. According to their own data, the coast guard of Russia is patrolling to protect its marine biological resources. During the new inspections 30,000 squids have been discovered. In addition, according to the data, three fishing boats and two motorboats were confiscated and transported to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Novosti, the coast guard recorded a total of more than 8,000 violations in 2018.
The Russian fishing authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there for some time in 2019, according to the media.
Georgi Martynov, head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, recently also complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. They also brought small creatures out of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decommissioned. Ships themselves would not comply with hygienic and technical regulations either.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard had been injured during the arrests last week. According to the FSB, a North Korean also wounded later died of his injuries. On 17 September, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened fire.
United States impose ban on ex-President Castro
The US has imposed bans on the entry of former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, which the US Department of Foreign Affairs stated in a announcement on Thursday with Castro's involvement in "gross human rights violations." As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he is presided over a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As president of the armed forces, the brother of the deceased revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also guilty of human rights violations there by supporting President Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," tweeted American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had declared entry bans against members of the Venezuelan government and the military, among others. In Venezuela, a bitter struggle for power has been raging for months between the government and the opposition. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro’s government to bring him to his knees and give power to the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduro. The Socialist Caribbean Island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the U.S. and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress opponents of the government.
New Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia are expected to begin because of the time lag before the protests spread across Europe to North America. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to take part in a major rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
It is relatively unclear how big the worldwide popularity will be this Friday after the record participation of the previous week. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday more than four million people went on strike for the climate. This Friday we do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries within the framework of the strike week, she added.
Especially in Germany, the arrival last Friday was very big. A good third of all worldwide demonstrators - about 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities according to estimates by Fridays for Future. This time, according to a list of the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to take to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had taken a stand in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of her country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. This led to the Fridays-for-Future movement within a short period of time. The climate protests mainly involve students and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against the heating of the earth and the impending climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial period.
Thunberg arrived in New York just under a month ago after a two-week transatlantic cruise with a high-sea racing yacht, where she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech to the UN, in which she spoke strongly to the heads of state and government of the world. On Wednesday, in her native Stockholm, she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation for her commitment to climate protection.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
In the future, people in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony, which will change fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergency Affairs in Moscow, according to the Tass agency. The ban is due to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes nevertheless has to expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette is to ignite a fire, the penalty is higher. According to the Ministry, candles that are also burning fall under the prohibition. Also grilling meat skewers on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Attack against cybercriminals - Investigators raise servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time launched a large server provider for illegal business in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach an der Mosel via the international criminals.
This was announced by the Attorney General’s Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening during a major action. Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been, among other things, the operators of the world's second largest Darknet market for drugs, "Wall Street Market", which had been smashed by investigators in the spring. Also the attack on 1.25 million Telekom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in the cyber bunker, according to the Attorney General's Office.
A hoster of this kind has been raised for the first time in Germany, it said. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an internet presence.
In the access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9 there were searches in Germany and in neighbouring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon the investigators want to inform about further details.
New Global Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
Protests are planned in at least 65 cities in Germany, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests . . Who are Thunberg's backmen?
Justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more surprising is the fact that a 16-year-old girl, of all people of power at this time, is holding the mirror in front of the faces. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and makes young people rise up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to stand up for a fairer world. At that time, he also managed to win a crowd of young people for himself and persuaded them to cross the sea in order to get to the promised country, similar to how Greta Thunberg recently set out for America with a sailboat.
But is there a dark side to this? Why does it take a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book, which has sold far reaching, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Also old-fashioned followers of Greta Thunberg were a little disarmed about the last PR show, or the trip by boat was probably too thick on some successors. This is also not without reason, because the action came into effect in the media worldwide very well and a lot of money flows thanks to the impressive action.
Is it morally right to enrich yourself financially when saving the world? Is it even more authentic when certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue campaign? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives on various opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to critically question seemingly pious intentions of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet is currently crossing our solar system.
Astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed: At the moment, a strange comet crosses our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time the researchers only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and is currently employing astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
This body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov in Crimea. He looked up to the sky with a self-built telescope and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was seen during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gain close insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and currently moves on a so-called hyperbolic path that leads it out of our system.
Comet has been sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before the time comes, astronomers will be able to observe him closely, because, unlike his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in his approach, which means that he can be examined from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Agency Nasa. "After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about Comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comet - because, as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form by similar processes as in our, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual findings. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way of researching certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again the researchers employ asteroids. Only recently a giant asteroid raced past the earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson appalled by brother
Boris Johnson becomes more lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister scolds with clear words the martial language of the prime minister as "tasteless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "fraud", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly upgrading - at least verbally. At questioning in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this was met with massive outrage from the opposition, and in the meantime, other critics have spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the station Sky News that her brother used words like capitulation, as if opponents of an EU exit should be "hanged, longed, quartered, tarred and feathered." She considered this to be extremely reprehensible. She does not recognize the version of her brother, said Rachel Johnsons, who had taken part in the elections to the EU Parliament for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK".
In particular, she was struck by the fact that her brother Jo Cox mentioned an EU-friendly member of the House of Commons who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 referendum. Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons that the best way to honor their memory was by going through Brexit. "It is very tasteless to refer to a member of parliament who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," now criticized Johnson's sister. Obviously, the perpetrator came from the extreme right-wing camp, which feels strengthened by this kind of language.
The widower of Cox also strongly criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used in this way," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to stand up passionately and resolutely for what you believe in - no matter what you think, but never to "demonize the other side." He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen in which attacks had become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had resigned from office as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory MP. "In recent months, I've been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest - it's an insoluble tension," Jo Johnson explained.
Johnson’s language also met with sharp criticism in the Church. According to the Times, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is “not worthy of this country”. In a joint statement they declared: “In recent days, the language has not been acceptable, both in debates and outside the Parliament. We should speak with respect to each other.”
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL sets a strong signal: in the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-term show at the upcoming final of the US football league NFL, announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the US," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American football league, which will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2nd in Miami. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is Puerto Rican origin.
"I love the Super Bowl putting two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later also published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and will be shown in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. She made her world-wide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the mid-term guests is eagerly awaited in the US every time. This year, many also regard the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump’s immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the biggest U.S. sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. Usually, the NFL finale is watched by well over 100 million TV viewers, it is now also extremely popular in Germany.
Last year there was political controversy in the run-up to this. The reason was the dispute over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who, in protest against police violence against blacks, had refused to rise up at the play of the national anthem and had been severely attacked by US President Donald Trump, among other things. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a super bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the rock group Maroon 5 appeared was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and YouTuber adds Egypt's ruler: For the time being, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have influence on whether blood flows again on the streets of Egypt have spent the past week both abroad. One of them floated back to Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who in 2013 dismissed Muslim brother Mohammed Morsi, the country’s first freely elected head of state, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump praised Sisi’s action against political Islam and did not lose a syllable about the human rights violations on the Nile - in a week in which Egypt’s security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the president. He had “no reason to worry,” Sisi said at the airport in the microphones of state television. “The Egyptians don’t let themselves be led astray.”
The president believes that this is what the other man is trying to lead astray, who is currently determining what is happening on the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, where he does not have access to the security forces who would arrest him immediately if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only to a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the country's cafés, living rooms and tearooms: with his YouTube channel "Mohamed's Secrets" Ali calls on his compatriots to rise up against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president indulges in luxury and lets himself build magnificent new palaces, it is said. Ali accuses the army leadership on which Sisi bases his rule of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with these gentlemen for 15 years in his second job as a construction contractor, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding click numbers show.
After last week, for the first time since Sisi's grip after power, thousands had demonstrated against his rule and nearly 2000 citizens, including prominent figures from civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "million-dollar march" for this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would dare to take to the streets. However, there were isolated minor protests, for example in Giza near Cairo and in Kina near Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests, whose participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos could not be verified independently at first. Security circles said that the police had stopped the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators torn banners to pieces with the president's portrait last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces erected checkpoints in the city and on the outposts. In Cairo, several subway stations were closed down in the city centre for "maintenance work", most of the streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And in Rabaa Square, where supporters of the overthrown Muslim brother Mursi were entrenched in 2013 until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent discontents from gathering: Sisi's Future Party wanted to hold a major rally here for the president.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be Tahrir Square", Ali said in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let's not clash with police officers." However, as a retreat, this is not to be understood: "All Egypt is Tahrir Square".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options.
If you conclude an internet contract, you do not need to blindly trust the speed information provided by the providers. Customers can themselves check how much of it is actually achieved in case of abnormalities.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Consumer Centre Bayern.
If the connection always appears to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing possibilities. Thus, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the providers are carried out according to provider-specific specifications and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated", says the Consumer Centre Bayern on their side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days to produce the promised performance. This is best done by sending a letter of formal notice to the affected parties.
If this does not affect anything even after several requests, customers can terminate their contract and under certain circumstances also demand damages. However, if no success is achieved, only the legal proceedings will help.
First senior Republican for investigation
The Governor of Vermont was the first high-ranking Republican to call for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are being established," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken - an impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump observed Biden "for years".
Up to now, Republicans have been holding back criticism of Trump for the whistleblower affair; few have shown discomfort for this. Scott’s statements are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already repeatedly opposed Trump’s policies, such as the easing of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man stays in the MCU: Further Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how the films around Tom Holland should continue.
After "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home", Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This is reported by several US media in agreement. According to this, the cinema launch should already be decided: In the USA, the film will start from July 16, 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant" Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am pleased that Spidey's path continues in the MCU. Me and everyone at the Marvel studios are delighted that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does the sudden good news come about? Sony Marvel is said to have made an offer. According to industry magazines, Disney, which also includes Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenues of upcoming Spider-Man films. However, the news is not confirmed.
Thus Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finale
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the USA has now reached the grand finale. In the last episode, there were many happy endings and as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, were charmingly paid tribute. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers for the series finale.
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the finale for a final farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some reviews showed the most memorable scenes with today’s Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his prison sentence.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned casually in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) steps straight towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a very telling remark about his suit. Whether he actually threw over a coat, the stunned Harvey wants to know about the groom, only to then note snippically: "Louis, you are not the prince of England".
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat crash
A baby and four other children drowned in the capping of a refugee boat in the Aegean. Seven people died in the accident, as the Greek coast guard reported on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Currently hundreds of migrants from Turkey are moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that he will visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the relevant EU Commissioner, he wanted to inform Turkey about "the refugee situation", said Seehofer on Friday. Afterwards, he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to be able to help deal with them.
On Friday, a spokesperson for the European Commission confirmed Seehofer's planned trip with EU interior commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's interior minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an unusual number of migrants from Turkey continue to arrive. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, according to the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increase in numbers has led to doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016. This means that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants illegally coming to the Greek islands via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to receive a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every deported Syrian.
However, the handling of asylum applications is difficult on the Greek side due to lack of staff. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, nearly 29 400 people are waiting for Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The worst situation on Lesbos is that there are currently 5200 migrats in a camp with capacities for 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016 have there been so many, the state radio broadcaster reported.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to physicians, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate change is "very certain" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society of Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system caused high temperatures and high temperature jumps within a short time and led to heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics are affected.
Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photo breakdown
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign, was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian green boss holds a reusable cup in her hand in a photo. But now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, never held the reusable coffee cup with metal straw in her hand. On the party’s website she was seen in a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also distributed to the media - and there the cup was still a nasty (papp) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green boss has to answer for photo breakdown
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the Fake News party was producing to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection", in the middle of an election campaign for the House of Commons, in which Trudeau is also finding it increasingly difficult due to a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and appealed to the discussion about fake news. A user shares a juxtaposition of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairpersons to hide their disposable cup".
May was shocked and said on her blog that she didn’t know anything about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: She, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she put it correctly, is made of bamboo. She always had it with her. A party spokesperson said that it was only about placing the party logo in the picture, not covering up something. From the photo, there is only one section left on the website.
May writes that she is sorry for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and at the same time asked herself of her over-engaged team: "If they want to edit a picture again, couldn't they do something with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens have also come to Shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or for air travels - but their pictures were not photoshopped. So the boss of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoon on holiday, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencer wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng is said to have received an upgrade from Cathay Pacific by mail, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously get an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a change from the Economy Class free of charge.
This case shows, however, how not to do it: A self-declared influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram follow Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users. On May 30th she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the way out, Jaqueline's staff refused to upgrade, even though she had shown an email in which Cathay Pacific allegedly offered her an upgrade. The letter wanted the influencer to have received from an airline marketing staff member, while the airline accused Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
On the return flight Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman presented the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at the airport JFK were skeptical: They followed up at the headquarters. And in fact the employee from whom the mail allegedly came is said to have denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport cancelled Jaquelines Ticket and imposed a life-long flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about €1,280) she had to buy a new flight tick to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests, because Cathay had refunded her the price of her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. The airline’s terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices give way according to report on armistice in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday afternoon. Most recently, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent cost 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The trigger for the course slip was a report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought five percent of global oil production to a halt. The Huthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had denounced the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would defuse the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually reached, one can focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of the Raw Materials Strategy department at Saxo Bank of Bloomberg news agency.
Oil prices are thus continuing its downward movement in recent days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost $59, Brent nearly $65.
Finally, Bloomberg, referring to insiders, had reported that repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia progressed faster than expected after the attack in mid-September. Accordingly, the production volume had again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original quantity.
Recently, there have been several press releases referring to insiders reporting on rapid progress made by the state oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, resource experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some sense of relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after Iran's arrest and the recent release is on its way to leaving the port. The crew is now preparing to depart while the ship is still anchored, shipping manager Erik Hånell told the Swedish broadcaster in a text message on Friday morning.
However, the US announced that it would transfer defense missiles and soldiers to the Iranian archenemy in Saudi Arabia. Fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the US and Great Britain had at times driven oil prices significantly up in recent weeks.
Allegations against Trump are intensifying
In the case of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, accusations of cover-up against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials had made an intense effort to prevent access to the wording of the discussion at the end of July after a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj. This was explained by an anonymous whistleblower. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "covering up". Trump spoke of a "witch hunt".
North Korea deems third Trump and Kim summits to be questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that the nuclear dispute will soon lead to a third summit between Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. Kim Kye-gwan, a top diplomat, said Friday, according to the agency KCNA, the meaning and prospects of such a meeting are questionable due to the lack of progress in implementing agreements reached at the first summit in Singapore.
The US had not done anything to implement the summit's decisions in the previous year, the advisor to the North Korean State Department said. He also criticised the US sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the US and South Korea. However, he hoped for Trump's "wise" and "courageous" decision to bring things closer again.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what to do with a third summit meeting with Kim before he agreed to do so. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, both of them met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. In doing so, they agreed to revive the discussions, but so far without much success.
Prince Harry: Weapon manufacturers to help with mine clearance
In Angola, the British Prince Harry symbolically ignited and destroyed an explosive mine with a blue shard of protection vest. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near Dirico, he manufactured the ignition circuit. The explosive device exploded at a safe distance. Looking at the goal of getting Angola free of mines by 2025, he later demanded in front of running TV cameras: "I call on all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but who have not helped to clear the way to commit themselves to help".
Pounds under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of an early interest rate cut, the pound loses its value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt speculation that the Bank of England (BoE) would cut interest rates soon increases the pound sterling, and the British currency on Friday was reduced by up to 0.4 percent to 1.2269 dollars.
Sales were triggered by statements by central banker Michael Saunders, who talked about a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty will affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, as Saunders is considered to be a defender of restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Broker House ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens on the economy caused by the Brexit hack without directly signaling a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU on 31 October, even if necessary without a divorce agreement.
More: The British Prime Minister took a high risk with his provocations, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations proved
Materials from the Moscow analytical laboratory are being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today's integrity leader of the Athletics World Federation.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details about the doping scandal in Russia are emerging - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had gained back at the beginning of the year and only to some extent. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: they were forged.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport had been revealed. The Wada had then closed the Russian Antidoping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time Russian athletes were not completely banished from the world stage. After an individual examination, the International Olympic Committee had around 270 athletes of the country compete under neutral flag at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, 168 Russian athletes were at the start of the Winter Games in February 2018. They were also allowed to participate in the World Cups in the various sports, in the summer even the World Cup with the host took place in Russia.
Missing positive findings
In the following September, the Wada picked up the Rusada ban, but demanded access to the laboratory and the above-mentioned samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases during state doping. They should help punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the International Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analytical laboratory have been manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" of Friday. "We have found numerous discrepancies between the data the Wada received from a whistleblower and those received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings were missing, which were mentioned in the McLaren report.
Not affected by the World Cup
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association is the only organization to hold on to the spell of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put manipulations in the room and asked Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the renewed suspension of the Rusada and, in the worst case, also the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
