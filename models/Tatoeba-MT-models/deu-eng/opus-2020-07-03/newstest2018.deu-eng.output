Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A madman's place where young people are supposed to meet today.
A crypt chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is now dug.
Small farmers cultivate the former reason of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich reveals exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
Anyone who has ever had to get upset because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas, an offer of the geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but that is why it is very revealing.
Especially when you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the distribution area of Munich's Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bavarian Atlas is a patchwork that is not recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called urposition sheets, have been included in the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to information provided by the Bavarian Surveying Administration between 1810 and 1864, these emerged from Bavaria's first survey.
Your client, Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical view of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: it was the present neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavaria map.
Elector Max IV Joseph continued to push the project forward, founding the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek like all others.
The comparison In the past/today is most impressive with the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the map was drawn up, i.e. in 1877, as a Munich district.
Today Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.
Untersendlings houses are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was not named until 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwrittenly numbered hallway pieces from the so-called "original recording" from which the property tax was derived.
Small parcels no longer occupy farmers there - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sonne".
A large green area is emerging north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "on the Gasteig" or from the hill "On the Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße people were once locked up with delusions.
The Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was founded there in 1858/59.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist who was brought into connection with the death of King Louis II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of the so-called lunatics.
In addition, he has prohibited personnel from using force against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked on the institution for an exhibition.
For 280 patients there had been space at first, later it was expanded to 500 places.
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, there is the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatry in Germany.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
To the west lies the football field of TSV München Ost, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in an architectural style based on the original building of the madhouse, which was destroyed during bombings during the Second World War.
Marienplatz was listed as "Haupt Platz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs broke many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small shops and a medieval tomb chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work takes place and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn main line takes place.
The slider can be used to compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and to fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored People has issued a warning to colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention to travel through the state and to exercise extreme caution, as a number of questionable race-based incidents have occurred and are noted here in the entire state lately," the group's statement states.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as state law enforcement agencies that target minorities disproportionately, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, said NAACP.
"They have violations of citizens' rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints at such frequency that we haven't heard yet."
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he lost his fuel while traveling through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also draws attention to a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General’s office showing that black motorists in the state are being stopped 75 percent more frequently than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People have to be ready to bring bail money or let relatives know they're traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which rank the state 16th in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws, requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Willow fence project is elementary
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue next year.
The CDU MPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got a picture on site.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm, where he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and just as many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, "Black Forest Milk" is the unalternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also chairman of the BLHV of Fischerbach, he described the Weidezaun project as "elementary important".
I can't make a profit on such steep areas.
The grassland area provides a lot of work, much has to be processed with the motor sense.
"We are struggling with the conditions and topography here," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognised the importance of the Weidezaun project and is happy about the Leader support".
Farmers would have to be supported for costs of between 3000 and 4000 euros per hectare.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they can move their business forward," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticised for their support
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in via the Weidezaunförderung.
The open area thus amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was supported by Leader, a quarter by the municipality of Fischerbach.
This left farmers with 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible".
Peter Weiß was also convinced: "Best food is produced here".
The Landschaftspflege Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of pasture fences.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the presence of a support backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the fenced area must not be manageable for towing (attitude above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbach Weidezaun project 2018, eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, are currently applying.
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now Trump’s White House is taking the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he had.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to his base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller insulted Acosta, "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your distressed masses who long to breathe freely, / the miserable apostasy of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "elder waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who worked to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they carried out a highly political action.
The sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem with the painting is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this back for a long time.
The great screamer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative that brings the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
She's supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States."
There's something quite unusual about Limbaugh here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And, of course, that's not the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch shall not light the way, but light the hatred which is their only source of power.
2017 World Championship: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
UK Athletics Performance Director Neil Black says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship squad will "make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which will start on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that the UK's athletics must learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue until we find out," said Black.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy at the corner of the street.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m course, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Your captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, left the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great."
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes to date at the World Championships was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The mid-range runner Muir is leading this way and has set five British and two European records last year.
She will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scot who should be watched after a great season that included victory in the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots not only belong to the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on Podien.
As for my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship.
So it's really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it'll just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Do not apply for a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scolded the critics, sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said: "Free speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are led to slaughter like sheep."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for this earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "So what?" .
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as the primary means of connecting with his voters and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy to debut on his side.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum that is called official and employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The mail talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment section of the newscast "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, then some are more likely to disregard it as a so-called collective effort and not to recognise it as a large group of citizens concerned".
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "interference."
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in previous times if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that's what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue was in Virginia last week.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous pens struck his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overpowered his office, according to historical documents collected from the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are at the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comforts in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led links to the final round next door last year before losing to Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how it achieves its fame with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course at its best, it is in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job fixing this place.
He is an avid advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"That really feels special," said the Southport based player.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.
I'm happy about how it went."
With the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scotsmen on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, parking costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew up his own 1994 study on this subject.
At that time, there were 400 lung cancer deaths per year due to passive smoking in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove to be very complex
The construction work on Villinger Straße is in full swing and "is in time", says Fred Heinze, head of the building yard.
In the area of the house connections, the situation is more complicated than assumed, since much is hidden in the underground, which is not stated in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, is a major problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and barriers is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road was closed and only the regular buses were entitled to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already quite exhausting.
But fortunately, our friend Fritz Matt provided us with cool mineral water," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and swallowed with zealous, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, e.g. washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 pm," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was admitted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public hand raising in front of the occupying forces.
An existing movement for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea forming the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is boring. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated iron roofs, which were converted by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province of New Jersey with a population of 153,000.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion worth of timber resources.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 New York Times survey reported that Freeport paid nearly 20 million US dollars to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are mercilessly treated.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We'll Lose All" is said in a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of last year's atrocities, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric shocks are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened as Papua's resources bring in a flow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese waring canteens sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables cheaper in the traditional market than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old native of Paniai, who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
"It has cost the native Papua - the momma [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted in favour of Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at their tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuans, men, women, and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - in circles and imitating a bird singing - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators started throwing stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated up, an order was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document by TIME that was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and called for rest and called on the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, only bears a name, the TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Chief Inspector of Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they were under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Papua Police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured.
The news about the killings only came to Jakarta 'filtered' the following day.
Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura for three weeks, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so it won't happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto retreated when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, charged by the UN with "crimes against humanity", who claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with fierce infidelity.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take a unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly brought in here, says TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and the police's mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by triggering sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, in recent years thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is also out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the job of women who can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the more educated and prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribe council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on the reporting of international media remain tense.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises made by Jokowi's campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's restless easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rejected the group's accusations and said to journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and harassed him "We want freedom", according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai students," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, regard their voice for Jokowi as a "guilt" that he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that justice may never come to them, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire broke through on Friday in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 79-story building, 337 meters high.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high-rise building in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and screaming of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident who gave his name to George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units extinguished the fire and cooled the building around 4:00 a.m. local time (00.00 a.m. GMT).
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in the outdoor areas of skyscrapers around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In Britain, the police said they believe that the system of plates for isolation and disguise on the London Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Continue Best-of-Five
The president of the International Tennis Association (ITF) failed at the General Assembly with his big Davis Cup coup.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, which are often very long, but which are also very much appreciated for this reason, are thus preserved in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the Member States voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was barely missed.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our memberships did not accept the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions," said Haggerty.
It will continue to work to improve the competitions.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the finale in a neutral place had not come to the vote at all.
Only comparatively smaller details will be new from 2018 onwards: the Davis Cup and Fed Cup finalists will have the right to host in the first round the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places etc. are made easier and players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers bring prohibited items to the plane, finds out a survey
A survey of flight passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past the U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered late that they had been travelling wrongly with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers rather disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they were knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7% were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs on the plane.
The company said it questioned travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled through airport security and how many deliberately did it.
It is no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through safety were those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain about which liquids they are allowed to take or how much of them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are banned liquids.
For a while, people thought TSA could see books as contraband.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electro-thousandsassa Elon Musk likes to indicate with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far neglected that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever triumphant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed a different, less brilliant figure for the first time in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
Musk had frequently advertised the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car in recent months, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation Tesla will pay back the 1000 Euro (in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "Reservation payment" completely.
Currently, 455,000 such non-binding reservations are available, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla CEO does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders so far could be a problem.
His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not demand, but production.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it will be 500,000 - all models taken together - and one million by 2020.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a Model 3 today, you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines that have never been tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPO CEO Pruitt withdraws due to the delay in the Obama Era’s rules to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous post in a federal court of appeal.
This is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid "interference in local decisions or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's prosecutor prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry oppose.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitt regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a U.S. Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the EPO administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the EPO's willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others and, in an agreement, set the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority that gives us seriously."
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion stated that at some point Pruitt would use his "authorities for delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules were "based on sound policy and the best available information".
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPO this week, said the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPO's reversal - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone arises when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists cheered over Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe in," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological crusade to turn to polluters and their particular interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made Tumlingen's friends and supporters their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem".
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergian charter book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogtei on it" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.
According to the text of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a stately court to which the church or the patron saint's right belonged and not vice versa.
So there were also people living there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the town of Tumlingen, the "Mountain" was the third, the ruling settlement center of the village.
Old maps from around the year 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.
Patronage law arose from early medieval church law.
A lord who built a church, furnished it and occupied it with a pastor, remained owner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
This involved the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The bigger one of the two burst at Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but later had to be delivered in the Second World War in 1942.
During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were smashed and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's night in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower gnome that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffigen Pensioners" are taking care of the Hilarius plant as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.
On Sunday, July 16, the Friends and Sponsors of Tumlingen invite the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle.
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Ortsvorsteher Hartmut Romann speaks the closing words.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 p.m.
At the end of the serenade there is a drink in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The Serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines tested
"Boisheim defends itself" sees no legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim resists itself" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, since at the time in Viersen only at the city border to Schwalmtal a wind power concentration zone existed.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
These zones are intended to prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan - but the Düsseldorf district government had not approved this because of a formal error.
"Due to the lack of planning requirements, the approval decision granted must still be unlawful and therefore withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim resists."
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the city council decided again on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "The granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines at this point is therefore prohibited by planning law".
The circle confirms receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received by Kreis Viersen since last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes them as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to stop the procedure.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the district did not wish to comment on the content of the argumentation of the association "Boisheim freht sich".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area on Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had already signed leases with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
The construction of the four wind turbines is intended to meet the electricity demand of around 11 400 households, equivalent to about one fifth of the electricity demand of all four-sense households.
NEW Re intends to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County.
Car and tractor crash together: Woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10 o'clock on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two others were slightly injured.
The Landesstraße remained closed for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich travelled the L 333 in the direction of Bogel with her 53-year-old mother as a companion with her car.
City and dealers plan "home shopping" weekends
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to shopping in the city center.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend should raise customers' awareness as to which offers the own city offers off the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies with their training places should present themselves.
In addition, the shops of the city centre should invite you to "midnight shopping".
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation, commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags point to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
The municipal administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
This means that the trade association and the city are entering another stage of the "Attractive Downtown" project.
This includes new offers such as the first "active day" for the Brunnenfest, including Sundays open for sale, discussions with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be tapped new or again.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city center while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help to revive the city centre - up to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network that had partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities will participate for the first time on the third "home shopping" day in Germany.
Besides Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities", says Streich.
The action led by the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his or her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work, a gas explosion occurred in the school building.
New people were injured.
During a gas explosion in Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others were injured, some of them severely.
According to the fire brigade, on Wednesday (local time) a wounded person was still in critical condition.
A person died when a part of a school building collapsed during the explosion.
A missing person was later also recovered dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As the cause of the accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on Mexico for paying the border wall after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27th, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president insulted him because he publicly denounced the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US and swore to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that taking over a trade for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia is "laughing", "bad" and "stupid" and that the existence on the trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a "depp" after proposing a ban on the relocation of refugees to the US.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he told Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford massacre: Activists reintroduce racist lynchact as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury raced through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled towards Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped out to block its way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstrip suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"We want this n-- r Roger!" the man shouted.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams tore the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22nd, is just a replay.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience exuded very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really incredible that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of re-enactment.
"It's a stain on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia Congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want cessation, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We cannot attain healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A coroner puts a bedcloth over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a ruling by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farm tenant Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in town was that Hester slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was wearing was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecutions that was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks makes it even more concise.
"It was an electoral right massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and vote, this will happen to you."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual re-enactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is vivid, poignant and is based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe does not exist in America anymore.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching, because then we will be confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - rushed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-recorded overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He has played the role of Chief Clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to those times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom yelling at Hester and harassing him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n-- he, get away from my property!"
Rascona returns the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs loudest.
"What?!" Rascona asked.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said 'n--he' back then."
"Yes," one of the other black actors joked.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And that's where the energy in the room shifts, a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands above the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays' grieving eulogy "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred metres behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple from Ithaca, New York, came to see the performance, many of them just come down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia's oppressive humidity for almost eight hours when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you're standing on the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpses.
Children squat on their heads, register the fake blood and silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"You're not really dead," a little boy mutters as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw the lynching rope away and wipe their tears off.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience will sit down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chats excitedly about the re-enactment with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about the feeling that the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds coming from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me think that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today it's just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone holds Brook's court at his table, eating and reminding of civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The re-enactment is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like if we don't learn from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are doomed to repeat them."
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also relies on a colorful and frivolous staging in front of a gigantic six-story backdrop.
The rotating stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner with the wall rest and the Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-oldtimer parked in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - that runs through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drag a body into the trunk in Hollywood manner and give the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen, which is surrounded by the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who bows modestly and forms his hands to the Merkel-Raute, are celebrated in a stormy manner.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in light of the great heat again in casual casual clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors was eagerly awaited.
In 2013, he had had to pass a whistling whistle concert, and five years later there was a big cheer in which the occasional "boo" shouts went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner was probably pleased about this.
"You can see that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in a way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but had also grown an understanding of his point of view.
I'm drawing a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several locations in their volunteer year.
Everywhere?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at school all day.
What are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I'm dealing with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years old now, so you're a late-time volunteer.
How come?
Menge: I graduated from high school.
And then a degree in civil engineering, let's say, successfully aborted.
I realized to myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing?
Make a social year, there's an insight, you can see what it really is on the spot, maybe in the focus.
And was that so?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my social studies in the winter semester.
I'm going to study dual, probably do a social worker training at the Herne Youth Office and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.
Isn't it a bit unusual to have several different locations during volunteering?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partially in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of your head, each with a completely different story behind you.
Whether a refugee, a youth who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you weren't scared to touch?
Menge: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson shortens another 3,000 jobs and shortens the dividend to revive the business
The UK education group Pearson said on Friday that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme would be launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The job reduction announced by Director General John Fallon for the majority of the time at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 comes in addition to its previous restructuring, in which already 4,000 jobs were lost.
Pearson announced in May in a third cost reduction program a cost reduction plan of another 300 million pounds (394 million dollars) to revive a business that was taken by the rapid move towards digital learning.
The company, which had sold its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Kabul Convoi Attack: Nato Soldier Killed in Suicide Attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and one interpreter had been injured, a NATO statement reported.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last act of violence that Afghanistan has taken this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
Nato's statement states that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening, when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosive device carried by persons".
The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are being treated in the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack since the US-led troops displaced the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies, and in particular in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO reverses decision to delay the smog rule after actions
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay the Obama administration’s regulation, requiring states to contain smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency for action.
Late on Wednesday, the EPO announced the decision to advance the so-called "Ozon provisions 2015" and said it showed the Agency's commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners," said EPO CEO Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPO's intention to delay the ozone regulations - which are intended to measure pollutant emissions in part of the country in order to determine where cuts need to be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday saying that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth according to Trump.
However, efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of major emissions on public health.
The EPO website says that inhaling air containing ozone can "reduce lung function and enhance respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Municipal council wants common area
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the municipal council of Fluron-Winzeln decides to set up a common room in the future senior residential complex.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the still missing property part is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still be a long time before the area belonging to the church community is in the municipality's possession, there is now no longer any planning obstacle for the project to be managed by a private investor.
There is a debate on a common area.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council are planning to provide such a common space not just as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the senior-friendly housing, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word "knit café" made the rounds.
The decision, which has already been taken last autumn through the provision of funds for the current budget, is being sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is located in the renovation area.
The establishment of a common area, according to Tjaden, would be eligible with 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal to the investor that he does not want to be thrown between his legs in this respect, provides for the conclusion that both saddles - which are based on the surrounding buildings - and roofs - would be possible, which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical.
Unnecessary, not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks, is this addition.
If it helps, he'll go through the board with one voice.
It's not that easy with the common room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings with which one does not make such progress, but one now leans at the common room out of the window, she says: "I do hard with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common area - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because the acquisition of the land does not give a grant, but rather receives a real countervalue, in case of doubt, which can be marketed, is the opposite.
Staiger's request to include the proposed decision accordingly found three supporters.
So it remains with two votes against in the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarizes in this way: "If we take the decision like this, we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: cyclist is hurled on road
When crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was hit by a car on Wednesday in Garath and seriously injured.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been coming from Hilden by bike on the road Schwarzer Weg.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A passenger car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder went on the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the oncoming traffic.
He collided with a car driven by a 66-year-old Hilden.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a racing car.
FC Bayern Munich has to give up David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to leave the game against Dortmund.
FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season.
Seven pros are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the cup winner.
The personnel worries at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 a.m./ZDF and Eurosport) with cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
In the duel with BVB, coach Carlo Ancelotti also has to give up David Alaba.
That was confirmed by the Italian on Friday.
The Munich-based Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are also missing.
Ancelotti has made the physical condition and lack of balance in his team's game responsible for the five defeats in the last six test games.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," said Ancelotti, adding, "The most important point is balance in the team.
It wasn't good at last."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The crew is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game".
The duel of the two German football heavyweights captivates the fans.
The match is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Wandering from star to star in the resin
In the Harz, the first "star path" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the Verein Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many visitors to the Harz region, it said.
It combines nature, science, movement and athletic performance.
The members want to set up panels along the planned route and then inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well accessible installations in five to six locations" in the Oberharz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber could be considered.
The information on the panels is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility was also a criterion.
Later, the star path train will be extended by train.
"On the Sternenpfad, viewers learn a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," explained the association.
In addition, they learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines stronger than another, even though it is much further away.
It also indicates in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to see it.
Since 2014, the association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
According to the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, the location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are clearly visible to the naked eye from there.
In the Uni-Stadt there has been something similar to the planned Sternenwerg - the planetary path - since 2003 at the initiative of the sponsoring association Planetarium Göttingen.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (community of the same) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including Pluto at the end point degraded to the dwarf planet - are set up exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
But the march to the next Fixstern would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound for pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I went up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweights [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year in order to settle a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who is also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23rd.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode, because all fans asked for it," Garcia said and later openly expressed himself to fight in the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he might participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the triathlon champion from Riverside "looks very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off".
Garcia said the focus was to show impact strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building up for their own struggle.
"This is the battle that must be fought.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."
Four injured by tyre fitter
In the event of an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people were partially seriously injured.
According to first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira probably lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30 p.m. shortly before the Marktbreit junction, after a tyre racer.
The car hurled to the right into the embankment, where it overturned and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 to the north was closed for about an hour, then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Triad chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue will score points after the 2-2 opening of the season against Braunschweig.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, with the result, too, if the two opponents had not been in the 2:2 match against Braunschweig.
"These were two counter-gates too much, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defensive player.
In the Erzgebirge, the triad chain will also be further optimised.
And a goal after a free kick the fortunes no longer want to catch.
"For the future, no one will stand on the line next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better able to cope with the Dreierkette, even after the experience of preparing for the Dreierkette, than with the Dreierkette.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have players who can build up well in the triads in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann right now," Hoffmann said.
"The condition is, but that we harmonize even better and that we do not afford so many play mistakes in building."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can speak of a failed start after a draw, don't know.
The performance could be quite okay," Hoffmann said.
"But if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the trophy, we will certainly be able to speak of a proper season opening."
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I don't judge the start of the season until after six to eight match days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely due to a storm.
"Now they can practically start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that players from Aue might even be a little bit fresher, as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascension favorite in their bones.
"But they don't know where they are currently," says the Fortuna's internal defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go as an easy favorite on Sunday to the meeting in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we sweep them away just because we have the claim to be among the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," explains Fortunas Chefcoach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish Asylum Age Evaluation Tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started conducting the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they should make the assessment of age more precise after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationverket) was criticised for failing to assess the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationverket has sent out 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results in recent months are consistent.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics of recent months, the figures are quite constant," he said to the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases where the person was considered over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "propose that the investigated person be 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had frankly said that she was going to be 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are taken, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Appraisal of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can," he told the Metro newspaper.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full on plan
The work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport at the Freiburg Government Bureau.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach that need renovation.
The end of construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the schedule is being adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted bridge made of concrete, covered with red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has come into the years now.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three structures are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red coloured sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meter wide bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning and a weight of seven tons.
This is a border fastening, which is also used as an operating route.
On Friday, a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.
Then the pedestrian path should run on it.
The special feature is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of pipes through the building in Lauterbach required a special touch.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project by hand in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting pond in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a single lane by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully closed.
The cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colourful protest at German potato salad
It doesn't happen so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) represented in the Vulkaneifel district council are part of a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on this day, because the AfD invites in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the poster "great campaign opening".
And well-known names take off - like Alice Weill, who together with Alexander Gauland is the leading duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September, and the Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD-lers, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally the town picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
It's a colorful picture that's there.
And what Christa Karoli, Chair of the Forum One World and one of the leading organisers, is really happy: "Great how many people have gathered here".
There is music and plenty of food, including a "original German potato salad, which the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, they show presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD get on Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reported that he had tried for such an event and was awarded the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but got a cancellation there, because due to the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces available.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here".
Looking at the event on the Rondell forecourt, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing is that it remains peaceful".
It also does: At around 8 p.m., a band provides entertainment on the Rondell forecourt, in the Stadthalle various speakers, including the Rheinland-Pfalz AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weill, and the Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but it is also time to clean up shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can move away - no special occurrences.
Trumpet hits Trumpet
Listening to the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli will be in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkanfolklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
Petkov is solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo posunist with the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Thus Johann Sebastian Bach sounds as if in a new garment, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by jazz echo prize winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play mix into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core piece of the program was only premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more so: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," says Kristen Stewart openly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what's next?'."
The Hollywood star's probably best known relationship was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who ultimately split up bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and seriously believed it.
So I've never been confused or hindered.
I just never liked not being taken seriously."
According to "Bang Showbiz", she suffered particularly from this, but during school, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I was looking like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, 'Girl, be proud of yourself!'."
Especially to the public, they don't like to explain their love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some people call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself in front of the whole public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he is changing the party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, on Thursday night, the Republican National Committee made a statement saying, "The party change of Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would stop us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
The global leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be re-entered in sport.
Russia's athletics leader Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics that his country's banishment from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were snatched away from gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation recognized within itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is being redesigned."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia would accept the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to re-establish Russia," Coe said.
"We have to do everything we can in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Championships in Athletics, which will begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug testing is still inadequate and banned trainers are still working freely, he told reporters in London after a talk at the IAAF Council.
Tragedy for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a funeral ceremony in Fritzlar in northern Hesse, around 1000 people of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali thought.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the still unexplained cause of the crash.
However, she described the two lost pilots as "Könner ihrs Fachs".
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse had died in West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to Fritzlar Cathedral St. Peter on Thursday accompanied by a wake of the Bundeswehr.
At midday, only the family members of the church took leave.
After that, the funeral service began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Grief guests laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm on the coffins.
In front of the church Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the soldiers killed as "highly decorated" and experienced.
The captain of the staff had built up the flight of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also declared: "If this crew could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able to do so".
Minister von der Leyen did not show any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the deployment was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral ceremony, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the announcement continued.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, it is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of his not being happy with his title.
After the accession of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also took the title "Prinzgemahl".
Since Henrik had not received the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself equal to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokesman of the Danish royal family, explained.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's been working for over the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, Margrethe had met in London in 1965.
He worked at the French Embassy on the Thames.
During his later wife, the sympathy of the people always flown, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand in his almost 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knit socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, who I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals in this country, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
That was two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants speedy re-election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the state parliament after the loss of the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Weil spoke out on Friday in favour of the dissolution of Parliament.
Prior to that, the surprising resignation of a Green MEP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official election date, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Former Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained in Hanover on Friday.
CDU Group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his group that they be recorded.
CDU and FDP thus had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Grüne 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the Landtag decides on its self-dissolution as soon as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its next steps on Tuesday.
The Constitution also provides for the possibility that the Landtag withdraws confidence from the Prime Minister and elects a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined legally cleanly," said Thumler.
"You will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally soundly examined."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but a bit curious".
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She described herself as a follower of black-green.
The Greens called on the apostate MEPs to return their parliament mandate.
"Of course, we assume that she will return her state parliament mandate, which she has received via the green country list, with immediate effect," said the country's presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
Green Group leader Anja Piel said: "We greatly regret Elke Twesten's decision".
She had deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of red-green," wrote the Federal Chief of Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag quickly re-elected.
The exit of Twesten costs the majority of Rot-Grün in Lower Saxony.
The politician "in her injured vanity and in her frustration put her personal interests before the welfare of the country", criticized SPD General Secretary Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony participates in this dirty intrigue and tries to make political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony's CDU Group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his MPs to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the result of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was at that time the strongest force before the SPD, but SPD and Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament.
Interview with Agriculture Minister - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp on them.
On the consumer protection portal www.food warning.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at the moment, a health risk is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the reconnaissance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has been set up without delay and has been in close contact with the authorities of the Länder since Germany became aware of the concern.
All information and risk assessment is available to consumers.
Trade, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are marketable and safe to health.
If the maximum residue level for eggs is exceeded by 0,005mg/kg, they shall not be marketed.
However, uncontaminated eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, it's not the companies' fault.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, production plants are not directly responsible.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in case of emergency.
Is there only a lack of personnel or of consistent competence?
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100%.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the handing over to the public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may exist are crucial.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide complete information.
Is regular alarmism really necessary for food scandals?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and transportable food.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
Through the battered means, manufacturers, traders and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in keeping food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be worked on consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and fully.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, because the governing organization that has supervised the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must counter legitimate sources of income that allow them to break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred enormous debts in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher matter.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini has fallen into disrepute from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA follower Aleksander Ceferin continues to campaign to deter excessive spending.
"Surely, FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the proceeds for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million can be shown in the annual financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, hit the PSG with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014/15 season remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by bloating their revenues through companies that are connected to the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates, UEFA would not accept this as a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of PSA's sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come from payments made by the World Cup 2022 Organizational Committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 denied that Neymar would become a World Cup ambassador and that such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to find out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, told me on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association assumes that the turnover will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and she tried to prevent Neymar's move away by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, of the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country owns an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced on-board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to come to a possible end: the airline rewrites the order.
At the request of the news agency sda, Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the speaker.
Around 17 million small red and white chocolate tablets of 14 grams per year distribute the flight attendants to the passengers before landing.
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwestern Switzerland" to be 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs.
But the advertising effect is always more important: for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to try to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Since 2006, Swiss has been distributing chocolate panels on board its flights.
Before Swiss signed a contract with Migros' daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
Swiss introduced the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are spoiled with treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey, both in business and economy class, also distributes on the short distance.
Athletics - Discus Olympic Champion Robert Harting achieves World Cup finals
The three-time world champion is fighting for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup selection and could only watch the discus competition from the grandstand.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far, qualified for the final match.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s Grunge era (when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors playing horny kids growing up - they still managed the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more by the watering can principle, including a riff on the stalker movies of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Rocks the Cradle").
At one point, a character browses through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates, and "a series of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-evil plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lower lip beard from "Singles", whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like some kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series until he achieves what I assume to be his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the gang how she will attend the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director states to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The leading roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to look at (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
In six long episodes, it pulls away, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", who was edited to a lesser length, could deliver his Agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for a feast.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we do it even with our own recent history and with its own.
Attack against drug mafia in the country
The police have managed to beat the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as reported by the Prosecutor's Office of Konstanz on Friday.
15 defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, the officials secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested during simultaneous raids in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two Italian suspects.
The two are therefore presumably delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were in action.
The members of the mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
Since summer 2016, the Prosecutor's Office of Konstanz has been investigating organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo, and the investigators of the Rottweil Kripo had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four Palermo officials.
The investigation focused mainly on Italian nationals with close links to the Italian mafia.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to go on the account of the gang.
Weise complains of large gaps in the register of foreigners
"Data of citizens who should not show up there": According to a report, the register of foreigners in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to sometimes serious wrong decisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to large gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "partially serious misdecisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warns in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
According to data, the register covers 10 million people of foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by about 600 immigration offices in Germany.
Because the data had not been adequately maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who have long since ceased to be alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register."
"Faulty data input can significantly slow back processes," the report continues.
The statistics on people who are obliged to leave the country also cover EU citizens who do not have to leave the country.
However, such false allocations "lead to a distorted debate about how to deal with those who are subject to exit", according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government seems to have begun to send refugee families with children under 16 back to Italy when they arrived from there.
This is evident from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
Accordingly, the paper states that the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures "in relation to families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was virtually impossible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees are the responsibility of the EU state, which they reach first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
To justify this, the Office writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased considerably."
Italy provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers that these commitments are sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The domestic political spokesperson of the Left Group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Families with children are threatening human rights reception conditions and endangering child welfare due to the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system".
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach was already made available to other people in the blood donation service.
At least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Above all Jürgen Greule, who with his now 100 donations now shared 50 liters of blood.
Traditionally, in the meeting of the local council, the community appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It's brilliant how our bodies are designed for this and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood for strangers, even unselfishly," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"One single donation of blood helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, Head of the German Red Cross (DRK), who is responsible for the preparation of the canned food.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year, we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK circuit leader.
Obviously, the change to the theatre a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Already before that Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many people book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter cast 500 milliliters of their life juice ten times each.
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation slowdown have dampened speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "low" when it keeps interest rates on family income in the midst of increasing pressure.
The policy makers of the Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) voted in favour of keeping interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members aiming to increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But it signaled that interest rate hikes would become necessary in the coming years to curb Brexit-driven inflation, and it said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of withdrawing part of the Mammut Economic Package, which was issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will call for time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financing for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more under this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on households' real income continues to burden consumption."
With regard to interest rates, it reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "something larger" extent than markets expect.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "step by step" and "limited".
The downwardly adjusted growth forecasts of the Bank for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% projected in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
After this news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and fell by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
There is no change in the decision after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations of an interest rate increase and GDP rose from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to recover slightly after the Bank's end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small salary increases, as the tightening first gets worse before it improves.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" income collapse in the next few years, but she added that wages will "clearly" recover at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25% last August, following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to sink.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's last ruling on interest rates, the call for an increase in interest rates had increased as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell last month from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected and that it will pick up again in the coming months.
The bank said that the overrun in relation to its 2% target was "completely" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said, "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as lenders are clamoring for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those in whom the existing deals expire and the new mortgages conclude, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment in the NHS starting in September following a fight before the High Court against the funding of the drug.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) taken before sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after last year's Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention", while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called this "a decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The purpose of the study is to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is used, taken up and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said, "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the progress of more than three decades in tackling one of humanity's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said, "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at people in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September on, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will improve many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be for the study to be carried out quickly throughout the country and for no one at risk of HIV to be left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people infected with HIV."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said, "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will help to bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society'.
Living the big life: mezzanine and smart designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment at Earl's Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the spacious ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which to stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steelworks are quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, it was about building the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the top or bottom function."
This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms in full height on top of each other - with much extra drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window by Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance mirrored units provide space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
Through the perception of a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the steel-enhanced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you slide up the door, it glides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the floor space - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square meters of something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are in conflict with one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who took him to the Supreme Court to find out how their property and business assets should be shared.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the family founded Westco Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city center, Brunswick and Sorrento development areas, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one third.
A court record says that this means that Colin owns $316 million worth of property and Paul owns $176 million worth of property.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but instead accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages of Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first denim store.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little kid (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, where Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke 26 million upon leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark had become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation, Paul says.
Colin was very restrained, although he was a former AFL board member and, after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case is in the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution."
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the Chief on a more even course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior staff on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to repair: bad information that gets into the hands of the President.
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was annoyed by unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of posts that were convincing," former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to make sure that his personal media use involves a constant praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we others don't know - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more ignition without their intervention.
We'll probably never know about the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his associates have managed to keep trouble away from him several times, their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, made up of competing parties, keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that might promote their views of the world.
Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he insists on finding out where they came from.
This was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously gave the President a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter because of harassment, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence, or that he had made false accusations and revoked them in the past.
Trump read the article and started questioning employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped for.
The police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted criminals are naturally not known, information from the population is hoped for and asked for.
Europol reported on Friday about the action following the "EU Most Wanted" Advent Calendar from winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, according to Europol.
21 postcards have been compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online users have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to post-publication references on the website.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'Millionaires Series'
Some of the most wealthy homeowners of the West Midlands are back at war with some determined travelers who have negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their manors.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the "millionaires" series.
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, without being deterred by a trench excavated by the Council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unimpeded to find a way.
Angry residents have urged the Council of Solihull, who said that it is "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there Monday night after they were sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably even more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by giving long instruction to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my community tax if the council can't even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be called said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area."
A spokeswoman of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihulls Police. We are taking the necessary legal steps to ensure that they move on as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to check when we present our case."
From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
After all, with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost and income from the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision at that time was not uncontroversial in the municipal council.
But above all Freudenstadt's Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke already at that time of serious interested parties at the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it into a three-star plus-category house under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, building debris containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautiful close to the citizen", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
The facilities include a swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room.
One does not want to position oneself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an elevated inner city level, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to spread out, explains Scherer further.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He had already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The ideas of the city were identical to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to make a precise determination.
Just under a million euros, he reckons.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudestadt is a good market".
Russia affair: US Special Investigator deploys Grand Jury
According to a report, Special Investigator Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump.
The board had started work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper considered the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
The CNN broadcaster reported that there were already first subpoenas of the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence has long accused the Kremlin of interfering specifically in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as Republican advisors in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller has also examined more and more Trump's private and business environment.
A few weeks ago, the Washington Post wrote that the Special Investigator, Trump, had put himself at the centre and investigated the accusation that the President might have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Juries is to examine available evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether to file charges.
Grand juries are therefore also called Prosecution Chambers.
Most of the time they are turned on when these are major and controversial cases.
The procedure is always behind closed doors.
The panel may also be consulted by the Public Prosecutor’s Office to invite persons to be heard under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his then campaign leader Paul Manafort were also present at the meeting.
Legal experts said on Thursday night on U.S. television that the installation showed that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he would act quickly.
However, it did not necessarily have to be said that the Grand Jury would end up being called on to decide on the charge.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The history of Russia is a complete invention," Trump said.
The subject gives the Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about".
His special adviser, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But these also usually work in secret, he emphasized.
The White House supports any measures that have accelerated the work of the Special Investigator in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that there was no investigation against the president.
There was no reason to believe that this had changed, the statement went on to say.
However, Mueller had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this expulsion, accusations against Trump had become loud that he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey testified to a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his staff.
This sparked speculation as to whether Trump wanted to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special investigator, such as the Watergate affair surrounding Richard Nixon, who was later resigned, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the pressure of the president.
However, several senators from both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday that would make it difficult for the Special Investigator to be dismissed.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drifts in Antarctica
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has been removed from the ice shelf.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The Colossus, weighing over a trillion tons and measuring 5800 square kilometers, is now heading north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
A danger to humans does not come from him.
According to researchers, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear.
In total, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now aborted colossus was a part of the Larsen-C shelf ice.
Ice shelf floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus grows ever further into the sea and regularly breaks off.
The Larsen-C Ice Shelf is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this shelf ice was disturbed the balance of growth and abortion several years ago.
A complete shelf ice had disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen-C shelf ice is also in danger, as the front edge has never retreated as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of ice shelf ice and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it results after melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British Antarctic (Midas) research project.
According to AWI data, the Larsen-C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica, accounting for almost 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks off regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary from Swansea University.
"This is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists it is controversial whether the Larsen-C shelf ice will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say that it will be less stable".
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades a great many ice sledges of the Antarctic Peninsula have disintegrated.
This long tip of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice surface has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature had contributed to the decline.
In the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by about three degrees, making it one of the fastest-growing areas of temperature.
CDU wants home rate with staff
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU demands to withdraw from the employers' association in order to become more attractive.
It was only shortly before the summer break that the Kreistag waved through 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first working day over again.
The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously very sought after.
Around 620 applications were submitted for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
At present there are still 50 vacant posts in the district of Mettmann.
Doctors and engineers as well as general administration staff are sought.
The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the Kreistag and to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
At the request of the parties, the administration should "work out a concept for the recruitment and development of personnel".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the shortage of applicants in the future, it is said.
The overall concept should be oriented inwards and outwards, show concrete measures for cross-level entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were not known before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a real "competition of public employers".
In addition, a large number of employees leave the service due to illness or age.
High time to act, so that no more posts remain vacant.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the CDU's political group, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a fist-thick surprise in the circuit day when he publicly questioned the capping of personnel costs and astounded the other parties.
Peoples want to be checked for all the possibilities that make it possible to leave the local employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration should seek a house tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the towns and cities of the district," says Völker.
This means that the CDU is trying to pay employees and civil servants better than the public service tariff rules actually provide.
Salaries are currently strictly prescribed; increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy tightens the tone of NGO migrants rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that if they do not comply with new rules for their operations, they will not be allowed to continue.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organization 'Jugend Rettet', because their team had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been operating for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone right now," said the organization in a statement on social media.
"We can assess all the accusations that are currently being made only after we have collected all the information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from Youth Rescue, the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew will take on board dinghy migrants supplied directly to them by human traffickers and that smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting was reportedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor whose contents were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the authority of the Italian Coast Guard to monitor the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motive.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not entail "substantial changes or disabilities" in their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trial and sightseeing for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
There followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs, for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, lookout point lined up at vantage point, connected by "flowing" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days many meters of altitude were again announced.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed in healing brine in the open-air inhaler.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had come to know the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sport
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting over the stadium lawn sweaty in wind and weather?
The fact is: e-sport has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says Jochen Röttgermann, Executive Board member.
He is sure that "there are still many clubs on this train".
Next weekend, FIFA will be organizing the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where gamers from different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, you could be more present on these markets online than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is this about?
Computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or football simulation FIFA are contested at competition level.
As in normal sports, leagues have long been established in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is this a real sport at all?
For many, the idea certainly needs getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid responsiveness are needed.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to implement in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classic sports.
The scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sports.
Players are travelling internationally, it's like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros had thus been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
This is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.
However, the Deloitte consultants say that e-sports is "not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey".
Many countries are already on the international scene.
Major markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports has been introduced as a subject of instruction, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, Dutt states that the football leagues are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"Germany lags behind in the European comparison," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to glorify the old times, is no longer enough.
The aim was to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dutt.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only in football everything stays the way it always was."
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are now affected by the scandal over poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and took all the eggs out of the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been proven to contain no fipronil should be placed on the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of the lyrics that impell Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who killed himself on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and eyes facing down when she was sentenced.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance that they totally regret."
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find out that her "age or degree of maturity or even her mental illness have a significant influence on her actions".
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying that "there is no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pain we will carry with us for eternity," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, stated that she would be "traceed" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"No longer having this only person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention from Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case through some press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
One of the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lam of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to compete in the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation does not hurt.
There was something different in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich immediately saw, even if the extra garment was very, very small.
But since there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer to be seen on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, he made the band tied to his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the Confed Cup winner afterwards, after his first assignment as Bavarian captain.
Well, the start could have been better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But Kimmich could interpret the sign from the coach as well.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a game leader in the C-Elf, consisting of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come out of their holidays, but rather he.
Zuckerl is the best way to distribute it to those who are trusted to do much to keep them happy.
So anyone who has been chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew across the field as a mini-lam.
Right back, that's his position now, the white bandage on the arm did its rest.
And in general Kimmich worked in this starting formation like the one who can take the rudder in the best hands.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unheard-of troupe.
He had the view for the whole, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal thereby overplaying his lack of fitness (narrowly clapped); Renato Sanches thus, on devils come out to connect with the achievements of the Asia journey (also only partially clapped); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle thus, in their first appearance in the Bavarian jersey not to be noticed negatively.
After all, that worked out quite well.
Süle appeared next to Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acting sovereignly.
The namhaft occupied Napoli-Sturm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to build up the game a few times successfully.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not the way we hoped it would be".
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Game shift, tempo change: "For this style I was also brought".
How unusual this world of Bavaria is for the new arrivals, one saw after the match.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but certainly six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I have already noticed what is going on here.
In Bavaria you simply have to win every game".
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new guy that anymore.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's best-known footballer signed up via Twitter shortly before the match and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian legionary is a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and is feverish with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational shot.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bavarian dusel.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economics praises Wissing's Tempo
It often became irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Trier Business Association (VTU), says: "Wissing responds to the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has blocked all of them."
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry is hoping for a plan-setting procedure, and the construction law is expected to stand by 2021.
The western bypass of Trier, which is in the urgent need of the federal transport route plan, also plays a role in the country's plans.
The aim is to put the line into operation in December 2020, says Minister of State spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competitive companies.
As suggested by Wissing, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier aims at a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports which have been falling for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new Master Bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is planned for the master's examination and 2500 euros if graduates make themselves independent within ten years of the master's training.
But the homework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts were to be created quickly, at the same time the country lacked the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the IHK Trier.
Out of 56 new engineers who want to hire Wissing at the state-owned company Mobility, only 29 jobs have been filled.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Bald refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country invests more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 less in the preservation of national roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country, how it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It was also disillusioning to date the expansion of broadband in the country.
In 2016, regional companies rated grid supply in an IHK survey only with a grade of 3.4.
They complained about stagnant Internet connections and disruptions.
Former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where it cleared the field after four months due to disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said that the company believed that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is based, banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the enterprises as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralise exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coagulating the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the faults of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices, in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested, but drive back in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were charged, others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent the emission regulations in Europe, and an inquiry focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously burden Volkswagen: the luxury automobile manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
So that the Isar visitors can also take part, tomorrow Saturday a raft drives through Munich, which has a special message.
If it pulls again to the Isar on Saturday, he will see a large raft there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a common raft with Isar tourists.
It's the building department that wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large info transparent.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The launch of a public campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ..." the understanding of the Isar is to sharpen as a protected wild river.
Last summer, the raft passed the Isar River and this year, too, there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo's nostrils and laughing against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most widely published cartoon artists, the nostrils of his characters are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentinian still draws and works on a film.
His message: "Laugh, for there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his first years as an artist, he worked out as a draughtsman for greeting cards, among other things - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After working in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures roam around in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own data, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and watches, his droll figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on an animated film and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thousand feet as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is scheduled to appear on the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're gonna say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he relies more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence Threatened by Climate Change
It has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-like conditions and disease-borne insects, which causes great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
Solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Krämer, Zünfte, Händler, Vaganten or a Landsknechtlager are to be experienced these days in the city center.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Riodoce's weekly newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in Sinaloa State through organized crime, corrupt officials, and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children to the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter is their editor and inspiration of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special Federal Attorney's Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists rarely bring murderers to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we don't trust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times shot at him, probably because of the newspaper's name - which is translated as "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors tend to fly freely around Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot in the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, which are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the guilt of not being able to protect his friend.
He thinks two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, and suspected gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after seizing another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to practice journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many dead people ... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the joker who could curse like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He'd always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his ruin?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "regret a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, no mobile phones were allowed. Days before it was announced that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 degrees C) in the shade of a tree.
They were tasked by the state government to protect the Riodoce offices in a four-story building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half in a joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent police officers whom the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's issue, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending, which focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor's office, who carried out a kidnapping.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), who dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Only a few months earlier, the readers would have regarded the column of Valdez as the most well-informed source of the abduction.
"In the past, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of its slender body structure.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The Valdez office was re-dedicated to a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they themselves would never have expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration about another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it's his.
Journalists throughout the country have become louder by writing "SOS Press" in organized protests on sidewalks and buildings.
On that day, director Bojorquez left Washington to seek international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed because they were telling the truth.
Since then, she has asked that she be reassigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "encumbered" by organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were caught up in organized crime.
Last year, the media watchdog group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to shut up," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do so, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz in 2015.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when suddenly all their phones started humming.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.
From the curb, they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens cried up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police who were holding the guard to see if they were ready.
If they were even afraid, they didn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to Sinaloa, the Riodoce employees followed his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," said Bojorquez, "when the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street for coverage."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid their enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though a frightening one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "disturbed past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" described it as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurs who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved state has stunned researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
Fossil, discovered by him, was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of earth lump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink your eyes a little, you could almost believe that it was sleeping," said lead author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this herbivore, although covered with armor and similar to a walking tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a countershading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the countershadowing, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its base.
Although counter-shadowing is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today's living animals.
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use counter-shadowing -- think of deer, zebras, or girdles -- are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur was subjected to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for evidence of its life, including its preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but it is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you're just squinting a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he's sleeping."
The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, passed through the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank in the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from snout to hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long spikes protruding from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herbivore was washed through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail.
The petrified remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the skin remains still cover bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole.
In the thunderstorm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carbage.
There are many injured, miles of traffic jams and Gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) about 20 people were injured in a mass carbage on late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, about 5 p.m. between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm nearly 30 vehicles, among them probably trucks, had crashed into each other.
At first, no information was available on the exact number of injured persons.
They were minor to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman.
A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backlog of about ten kilometres was formed.
As one AZ reporter reports, massive obstacles also occurred on the opposite track - through numerous Gaffers.
The fire department noted the registration numbers of the vehicle drivers, who now have to reckon with sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 6:45 p.m., a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
A collision had occurred between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: you sit on the train and sleep with nothing to guess.
Or you are absorbed in your work and just have a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
The conductor comes and wakes up an unsightly or rips the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the automated ticket control system.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your place and use it to devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"When the offer comes, let's expand it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said a rail spokesman.
"Comfort check-in" is the term used by the railway to devalue tickets without a conductor.
In order to be able to use these, however, some prerequisites must be fulfilled: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway.
It must also be purchased via the app of the train DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway.
And finally you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: you get on the train, you call up your ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic depreciation will then appear for the test customers.
Train attendants will receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant comes to Y place during the ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can go back to sleep, work, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendants, simply check in yourself in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their journey time on the train more personal," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board member of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often travel by train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest troubles.
Because often, but in any case, one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the ID card is missing or another document you have to show.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to poor atmosphere in the compartment or large area and delays in the control of your own ticket and takes the conductor the time at the end to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet activated.
How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question, "What Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the one born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a mail from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," they said.
Confused, since nobody else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted an image of Brown's lifeless body stretched out on the street and would remain there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She left her cell phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield drive later this evening.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father wearing a sign saying, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed with a policeman standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman released his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you... animals all."
"This is not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This isn't the kind of murder we've gotten used to and we can call typical."
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and cried."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whos Streets?", in the cinemas from the 11th century onwards.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, they discussed a conversation that they had "about the black experience and the black condition" countless times before this morning.
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her with me," Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be brought up in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and constitution and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman-child.
I have the feeling that I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a location opposite the police department, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-complaint by Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism has completely changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field who is known for his activism around death row inmates.
His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, and together with six other locals, the team of Whos Streets followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We're talking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, as these people are portrayed, because that's how I'll be portrayed."
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from Whos Streets show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, coined the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything."
Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement is really being maintained by black women and many black women".
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity.
"She was the person who shook up this energy," she said.
"It's no coincidence, even though she was at the front line, because in a life at these intersections as a black gay woman, so much is at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21⁄2 years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "dream" to "magic": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The topic hardly leaves you cold.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the Bit-Gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "No man brags" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Great madness!" (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the Bauernmarkthalle stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the start of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - namely to Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying almost weekly in the Bauernmarkthalle for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always very much like.
We have also discovered the butcher's shop for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, too.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
But this should probably not be very low for the new project."
Eva Kilic: "What are shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this unnecessary.
There's plenty of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved for us.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no more special deals and what is left of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit in with Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the Bauernmarkthalle go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the Ghost Bit Gallery manage to drive all shops out of Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "This just won't work.
And no one needs a shopping center that's empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers' market instead of this gallery.
But there is no place for a farmer's market hall thanks to the insanely many - I think - senseless construction projects in Bitburg.
When the farmer's market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A fitting similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which almost imperceptibly resemble each other - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek tuppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the footage from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after making public classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemplance (A Matching Similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in office.
Dewey-Hagborg has, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data, created a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been openly discussing identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud, and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy black-and-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits uncomfortable on a driver's seat and wears a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stumps and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained during a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal pen pals who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book "Suppressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas just a few days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to resolve.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name has a heart) called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's highly developed scientific lexicon) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data is to an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on view.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.
She shows Manning showing up with a hands-free phone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong.
"When they cancel your speech, they win," they say.
"So don't ever shut up."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, greetings from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacras, which gather together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 " 2, Manning's stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind her liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford wanted for killing
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are wanted as a suspect after a man was stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, warrants for murder were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the Cook County District Court files show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several engravings.
A community alert system published by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27th.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives investigate the stings as murder, while the police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now on leave and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal case under investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the UK police and ready to help the U.S. investigation authorities in any way possible."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27th.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management team at Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA road map in the near future" - Russian vice-premier Mutko
Russian vice premier Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) were implemented.
"At a certain stage in meeting the Roadmap criteria, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could give Russia cause for concern.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said, "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit something that does not exist."
Mutko's words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In a conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one is planning to accept this report unconditionally," added Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded from carrying out doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the course of the doping scandal by WADA.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Aldi no longer sells eggs
This was announced by the groups of companies.
It was a mere precaution that no health impairment could continue to be assumed, according to the Communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been shown to have been tested negatively for anti-louse containing fipronil.
Aldi wanted to create clarity and transparency for his customers.

Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck of your e-commerce start-up with your employees, but the polls didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or, worse still, deceitful.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the trial.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She called for help from outside.
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, provide employee anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that they gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can drill why.
Companies are coming to realize that they need to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you don't become the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118,7 billion in value in 2020, according to the financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convergence, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity early this year in the midst of the Uber case in miscredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Chief Executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, it can experience costly consequences due to consumer boycott, employee flushing and lawsuits, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of employment experience," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that they couldn't prevent their dirty laundry going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in February financing from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising total capital to $47 million.
Glittering secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only deployments.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong, and that the work they do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are committed and committed.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it's no wonder you'll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on its way.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Kotter International Business Management Company, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Did you really hear me?
Will you take care of it?
And if you don't care, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, Errett said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, and to add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights about its employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bond of employees in an industry that is known for high turnover.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It's 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players talk on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have undressed their jersey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the finale on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of UCLA should start at 19:15 in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons of play in Westwood did practical exercises.
They are scheduled to do 18 exercises in the course of August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparation for their opening against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the NCAA rule change, even if she added another point to the players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it through, they keep poking, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it'll be really great."
UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of vision of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the upscale class that has already been thrown at with footballs that have cleared a protective net behind a gate post.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then preparing to record an exercise there.
If you have the video tape from an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third party fact-checkers and then display their results under the original post, said the world’s largest online social network on Thursday. It’s one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to fact-checkers who may display results of fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for fake news, many of which believe that it also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact check will be started in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"Besides finding out what stories are being challenged by third party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its feature on the "related article" and work on other changes to its message feed to reduce wrong messages.
Creating a comic novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were there.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I overrated my welcome a little") all this seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust was not granted full access until 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees just started to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years when aristocrats said, "Oh, throw it in the attic."
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "One might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that two families fought for.
Guys, let everything go its way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book called 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start.
Maybe they're connected to each other?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit father whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', which depicts the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, time and again making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys with a talent to advertise heiresses."
After the end of his engagement in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with fucking life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Chapel of Mary in Rhöndorf
With the covering of the 301-year-old Chapel of Mary in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday for the introduction of a new umbrella brand (Thursday Round Show).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too good for us.
Or?", the makers of the action have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf Chapel.
"We don't really think that (of course!)", they write on their website, which was activated yesterday.
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we firmly believe that we, as Bad Honnefer citizens, know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than just a logo and a slogan, it goes on to say.
"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling point."
Finally, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a medium five-digit amount of its new umbrella brand and campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as it used to be, but in the Prime Minister's headquarters.
The five Vice-Premiers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Head of Government.
Thus, the civilians in the YAS were outnumbered.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air force and the navy were deposed.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt.
Against 486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt, negotiations have been going on in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the coup Erdogan had described the attempt to overthrow as a "gift of God", since he gave him the opportunity to "clean" the armed forces completely.
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unbehagen im Militär-Hauptquartier".
In the general staff there were concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifest themselves in the lifting of the headscarf ban for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
The big clean-up in the army and the security forces is still going on.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7395 state servants fired by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be considered the real lords of the country.
Three times they made a coup in reference to their role as guardians of the worldly order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least by relying on the European Union's reform guidelines.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately pushing forward an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the "Vocal Europe" magazine, an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this is true, such a development could not leave Nato cold.
In any case, there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the purges.
The leadership structures and operational skills are "weakened", say Nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for a reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and it will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries are given green cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump said, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to restore track for Rennsteigshuttle
Again and again in the past months the future of the Rennsteig shuttle had been disputed - now it should go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, the tourist railway is to be built on the dirt track on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to ensure the long-term future of the Rennsteigshuttle, construction works on the track will start this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, which is particularly important for tourism," said Klaus Sühl, Secretary of State for Transport, in Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of repairing the line was estimated at about EUR 2.5 million.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalized, said Sühl.
The Ministry and Südthüringen Bahn as operators were already in agreement on the technical details.
"This means that the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company would be concluded for a period of eleven years.
The Rennsteig shuttle should be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a train connection between Ilmenau and Rennsteig, which is particularly popular among tourists.
In recent months, pilot operations have tested whether the route is used by a sufficient number of people to order it regularly again in the future.
In addition, the route is in some parts very dilapidated.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it couldn't get any crazier in 2017, there's a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take her rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but companies are delivering a lot of them, and we're going to get to see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything, from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it gets even more disturbing as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventure" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible," the website of True Companion enthuses.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation, or she can be "in mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when you take a step towards Frigid (here: reluctant) Farrah, are most disturbing.
On his website True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and as the FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the verge of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks out of the fringes can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, where there is a president in the White House who boasted of having sexually assaulted women.
The most frightening aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Handmaid') is not the graphic images, the entangled bodies and the pierced eyes, but how realistic this vision looks.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as technically possible (although with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, put to the point, when it comes to their "personalities", the robots are not real women.
They can't separate from their companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to express it in the way of speech of 2017: maid
Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a sine qua non of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also divided small-scale families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump's choosing relatives.
We're all supposed to work hard to burst our filter bubbles.
Less notice has been given to Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she had fought with for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite strange on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I notice in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer resent us.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans, who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to his standards.
Today, I find myself infested by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the roof of the car that had a 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, are indeed a very mild crime.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in town if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clumping music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a strangely magical experience, since two two-year-olds, one 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go there and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street, it's the same thing, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood apologeticly grinning, while I was tired of having the experience of handing her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius left the prison for a second visit to the hospital.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which he suffered after a case in his cell, according to the prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first manslaughter sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013, shooting her several times through a toilet cabin door in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention this time to appeal against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecution Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and secondary schools.
Three of the release students will go to secondary school in the future, four to secondary school.
Headmaster Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
The 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle that grew up in the chicken farm, but was released into freedom.
In addition, the lively band performed a musical entitled "Der Adler im Hühnenhof".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and let his chickens hatch it.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken was broken, and the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain, and vanished.
Then classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank's enrollment.
The hens danced for the bet with the young goblets wearing cylinders.
The eagle stands for integration, said headmaster Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (cows), but belongs to it.
But he'll never be like a chicken.
His purpose was to be free.
She wanted every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.
This was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former head of the school Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps into class shortages, and the parents' representatives.
The chick time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She was reluctant to release her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
In the end, she had been able to rely on the fourth graders.
At the end, all the students performed a song of summertime and holiday time.
There was great joy among the children.
Eight first-graders are already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, reported the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television.
On the morning of August 1st, police arrested a group of illegally camping people in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened up control over free camping and impose substantial fines on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What People Need to Know Now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust emissions of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesels or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have cheat software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet given an exact deadline.
Daimler has announced that it will write to everyone concerned.
If an inspection was due anyway, this would be done within their scope.
How long should the overall upgrades last?
"It's hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers have not yet volunteered to act on the environment."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises you to wait.
According to Smetanin, foreign producers would probably follow suit.
Is a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars now threatening?
The ACE fears that.
But it is in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come - in protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are honoured this year.
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the award ceremony together with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear, known for his progressive TV series, has therefore already announced that he will not participate in the gala.
He said to the New York Times: "This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and that is burdening me."
59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
Kennedy Centre is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital, named after former President John F. Kennedy.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's mayor, will retire next year.
The position is already advertised - but suitable candidates are rare.
Wacker has been a mayor for 31 years.
And he still enjoys the work, as he mediates in the press conference.
He tells of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
Thus - taking into account the regular notice periods - there should be still enough time for an induction.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Building Law Authority for the Administrative Community, the applicant must have appropriate qualifications.
Because the city definitely wants to keep this function.
If they could no longer fill them out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But closeness to the citizens is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good business climate as well as a good mood between the authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have accumulated, to which Wacker looks back with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure of the construction office and its employees.
In the future, however, diverse projects will continue to be on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen car park, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter alone will be worth around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
Design is available for a city architect great room for manoeuvre.
With Haslach's own building yard and gardening, many things can be reacted quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is protected as a monument, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing mayor emphasizes.
In any case, the mayor has a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end, everything is going over my table."
He can count on long-standing employees for support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (Building) has been with us for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Low Building) has been with us for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to stay for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job".
After all, continuity is not only important for a good business climate, but also for the further design of the city.
According to information provided by the city of Haslach, those who wish to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to have a degree in architecture as a graduate engineer or bachelor's degree and have good expertise in the fields of building regulations and planning law.
The municipal development office is responsible for building and civil engineering, construction planning, land acquisition matters, administration of the urban properties, municipal farm with building yard and municipal gardening as well as lower building law authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: south track closed
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were damaged so much that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators believe that two male perpetrators have been searching for them since the night hours.
Near the crime scene, witnesses observed a pink scooter and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a lausbuben stroke," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA.
The perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also put train traffic at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system, as well as the minutes of delay and the costs for rail replacement traffic, the perpetrators could also be charged with pönals of the railway customers.
Overall, a "significant" sum should be assumed, said the speaker.
The damage was repaired again on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be managed without any obstacles.
Almost ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday morning, two of which concerned long - distance transport.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were late.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of causing inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result.
Experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal milieus, if the same system also works in humans.
The postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which, however, was separated, did not have this.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiome of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequencing and six types of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice' food, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genius", believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's £40 million signature began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last preseason game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward at will.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the Blues' preparation Asia tour and only managed for 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've made great efforts."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in Washington State, but the drawing began in Marquette in Michigan State and took the form of a dreamliner across the USA, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was to be the form of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already done such advertising before.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections.
Just no sturgeons from the party headquarters, just no headwind from the alliance - that was the most important wish of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees from the Willy Brandt House have been watching the events in the SPD-led state capitals with increasing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with headwind.
They were lows.
One at a time.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions between the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again that red-green simply cannot rule reliably," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising departure of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red-green coalition lost its one-voice majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Michael Kellner, managing director of the Greens, has asked the apostate Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate's will.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate," said the Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Deutschland (RND).
"That can't be true," sighs an SPD campaigner when the new Job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is without a government majority after the transition of the green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU.
It is the provisional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations.
And nobody knows what's next.
The Misere began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, nothing more, calmed the comrades at that time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different.
It then became - and it all got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the thumping, the Düsseldorf-Pleite overturned the party.
The comrades labored hard again in the weeks after that.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And with him came the next low.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because in crisis communication after that he did pretty much everything wrong that you can do wrong.
Since then Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for a long time.
Bad survey results were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been trying more and more in recent weeks to set accents in the covenant.
The desire of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden from comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz.
They let him be granted because they promised to stabilize the party from Weil.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
Weil is basically not to blame for the party-internal rivalry of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And certainly not Schulz.
At times the comrades therefore strive to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here above all at the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is intolerable and damaging to democracy how Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to parliament, not because of her person as a direct candidate, but via the Land List of the Lower Saxony Greens, according to the Lower Saxony MP.
The logical consequence would be for her to return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, laments an "undemocratic manoeuvre".
"The voter's will four years ago was clear: people have made Stephan Weil the prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the leading candidate in the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member falsifies the election result," Oppermann continued.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments by CDU Niedersachsen.
Grants for local centre III
If you want to renovate your old house, you can get support from the country soon.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler once again gave a review of what had happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding.
In the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - after all, it is important to promote internal development as well, and not only to open up new construction areas.
On 4 April, the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe had received information that there would be a redevelopment area III.
The funding amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 would come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How does a redevelopment area develop?
According to Schindler, one will investigate where the "real old" houses are.
However, it also played a role to rehabilitate whether there was any interest in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then also shift again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-state program "Social City", in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of city centres, the improvement of housing and employment conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object-based basis, i.e. per plot.
The redevelopment area would then be finally defined as a statute.
Since 1 January 2017, the granting period for the grants has been running until 30 April 2026.
By September of this year, however, the inventory would be carried out, in the framework of which the persons involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire to be completed.
In November or December, if possible, the statutes will be adopted so that the reorganisations can be started next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the preliminary investigations.
It was a question of assessing the urban grievances and deciding when they would be rehabilitated and to what extent.
A redevelopment note for the respective property is then also entered in the land register.
Pietzschmann himself will come to Empfingen again and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the involvement of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land arch", which, among other things, deals with the structural condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing questionnaire", information can be provided on the size, distribution and residents of a living space.
The blue "business form" must only be completed if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not a request for funding at the same time.
In addition, new construction measures were not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies works according to the "first-hundred principle" - who comes first grinds first.
One could not "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown in order to make the participants a "tasteful" renovation.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consulting anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company also wants to change the locks on homes and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all at a surcharge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The White House's advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military that was left to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was at the heart of the White House event on July 17 with American building programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter made in Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Bureau demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote HMX-1 commander on the eve of the event to his superior, the Deputy Marine Commander for Aviation.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at around 7 a.m. on South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 that evening.
The note adds that if departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of duty hours.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
It was not clear from the records made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Datasets indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate the determination.
"One of the questions we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked," answered the deputy commander.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president launched the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use it for the trip.
But to request their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential aircraft performed taxi services against the backdrop of its first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and its Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show "Made In America" - which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers using American materials," said the deputy press secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to provide the US president in the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on this day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said that taxpayers did not take the burden of any of the other props presented at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the US Department of Defense hourly rates for the financial year 2017, the VH-3D's DoD refund rate is USD 24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate.
"Determining taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimates of refund rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual budget."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, former White House press spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked for tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire engine.
In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before tricky task
==References====External links==*FIFA profile*FIFA profile*FIFA profile
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will start tomorrow from 11 o'clock in Kiel at the table third Suchsdorfer SV.
In spite of five matches, the leading player of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has kept the sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Especially on the rear positions I find the team very good."
For class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV mainly the imports from the high north ensure.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay with a view of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"As always, this will be difficult for us.
You also need a good portion of luck."
The Neusser team for the trip to the far north stands practically.
His debut for Blue-White could be Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman who is currently still active in the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not make it to the Bundesliga, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) who plays at the tournament in the Czech Liberec comes to his first bet this season.
Chilen Hans Podlipnik-Castillo, who had not yet been defeated, was still at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski.
He was to be present in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could join the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still the number one in the junior world ranking in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills up the squad.
How America Can Harm OMV
Donald Trump did not seem really happy when he signed the law to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In his haste to enact the law," the Congress packed a few "constitutional regulations," he etched.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed against the US push.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors of the local OMV, which co-finances the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies, have been worried.
The threatening backdrop is enormous.
However, it was too early to assess the impact, according to the oil company's official statement.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The press" has looked at which the group could avert and which could really hurt him.
Narco's Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is put in the spotlight in Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which Pablo Escobar's killer reveals, the series of Netflix is far from over.
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received its first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1st.
Roll backwards: The city hires 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the day care table itself.
With fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city's day care centers.
As of September 1, the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban children's day facilities (Kitas) again in its own direction.
This is good news for Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the youth aid department: "We were all very pleased".
Cooked is still out of the house: a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly boiled chilled.
The city operates 46 day care centres in the Krefeld area, and in 44 children receive a warm meal at noon.
In the past year 2800 children each sat at the tables, and demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat lunch in the daycare center," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care if children stay until 2 pm."
46 part-time workers have kitchen service from 1 September: they warm up the food delivered, add salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give out the food, clean, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a day care center," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the length of the hour.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the daycare team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"In this way they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for the day care center".
Because that's also what it's all about: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"Let the children help to prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful.
Also for the children.
"They have a known power in the daycare, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity was important for the children.
The cleaning of the daycare rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out in the future by special cleaning personnel.
In addition to improving the quality of kitchen services, this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in comparison with the cost of self-directing and outsourcing to the city, according to the Press Office.
And this, although 46 part-time workers are being recruited.
"But these hours are not so important for around 750 people in education," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will run for election to the provincial council. Three women are running for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have issued threats against an electoral process that coincide with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role.

Men trying to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men approached the 13-year-old, who was on Kolpingstraße with friends, at about 2.55 p.m., because they wanted to use the girl's cell phone.
But the 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
As a result, one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's phone and necklace, but this failed.
Without loot, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation's under way.
GMB concern on investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to make sure that managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie have a long-term commitment to production at their Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits alongside other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would "be the first to experience" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's "to express concerns that financing for the modernization of production lines will not be advanced."
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said, "The fact that we cannot get any clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly concentrated in the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a flourishing production presence at McVitie."
Pladis spokeswoman said: "The Tollcross branch manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly, as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, during which some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the legacy of Tollcross as a production site. Should our operations change at the site, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know this."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Beträtti
Paris Saint-Germain will not slacken its persecution of Neymar after making an offer of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record robbery three years ago?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 per week.
Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But three years ago, the PSG president warned the football world of this prospect?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to have one of PSG's best players signed.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players signed with them, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Betratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
On the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately knocked over a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus caused damage of more than 200 euros to the disguise of the vehicle.
Schramberg Police Station, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for information.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car approached him on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to avoid and touched the guardrail.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW was on the B 215 from Stolzenau coming towards Leese.
In the area of the area around Stolzenau, a passenger car met him on his lane, so that he had to avoid to the right.
The Touran driver touched the guardrail.
Property damage was caused by the car.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the road accident.
According to the accident victim, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the Commissariat in Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
That's what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the abuse scandal at Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen continues to provide discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche", said after publication to the German Press Agency that he expected an apology from the former Bishop of Regensburg and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be of great benefit to the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or at that time their wrong assessment of the events.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticised the fact that reporting on violence in the cathedral spats was measured with "two measures".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these were "despiteful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal," writes Scaraffia.
In an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said: "You like going to the church and that's a found food".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "clashes were a normal educational means" "to deal with naughty children, like I was one."
It would find it unfair to apply today’s standards to earlier decades, because the world had changed.
In connection with the reports of abuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely wrongly, writes author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger wrote the commemorative volume "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report, which the lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg, presented with the Enlightenment, say?
A total of 547 Regensburg cathedral spats were sexually abused "with high plausibility" between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s.
The final report says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be stated that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R..
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, in contrast to many other accused, it is noticeable that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even connect positive memories with him despite violence."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why he believes the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves it.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence on protective agents at Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholerist and perfectionist, who often became tangible when a Domspatz musically did not bring top performance.
How do you view this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually appears in it.
There are only eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at preschool also occurred outside his sphere of action.
At best, he can be accused of not having learned too late or of not having taken the first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as - so literally - "salvation", "heaven" and "better world".
For example, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also give a very excellent testimony, describes him as "warm", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "comprehensive", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always surrounded by grapes of children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has also led to fury.
The fact that he not only banged with chairs and threw the keyring on the ground, but also spread slaps and pulled too cheeky boys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologizes for it.
In order to save his honour, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, both among parents and teachers.
Do you also know such punishment methods?
Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.
I, too, have experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
However, compared to what this report is all about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in preschool, these are trivial.
One wonders if it is not more to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just fallen upon him.
Many of those who have never understood him are still working hard on the Bavarian pope.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, a great deal was reported on the subject of abuse at Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen in connection with the report.
Is Georg Ratzinger also charged with any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Quite clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were dedicated.
"I never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother," said one person in charge of the others, "it was all very embarrassing for me."
The real problem with the education of sexual abuse was and still is that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choirmaster, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a certain way.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger's role in the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: An interviewed student put it this way: "As regards sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) of all people would have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it's ... really absurd to assume that ... Jacks of all people have opened up to him more forcefully, or more clearly, or rather, than to their parents, boarding schools, instructors of trust, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that pupils affected in advance and/or their environment were entrusted to him could not be confirmed within the scope of the study".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is to be acquitted of any co-wishership.
Nor can he be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to justice.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was much of "waltex zessen" at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen.
The former cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger is accused of looking away in the report.
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem, that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence excesses and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is exactly what the report is about to be misused.
There is a clear separation: between the preschool and the Gymnasium der Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence, and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the cathedral spats.
All the terrible beating pedagogy, the cases in which boys were literally harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly from it, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got to see the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On this, as the vast majority of witnesses stress, the subject "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even connect positive memories with him".
So the only thing left is the accusation of having looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods during which it was told of preschool conditions.
The first time in 1970/71, when he just started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
He pointed out that "pre-school punishment continues to be practised".
Already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when beatings were banned in Bavaria as well.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as everyone of us probably remembers.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected might have exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he's always looked away.
That's just not true.
Only in 1980 was the beating penalty officially abolished at schools in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "fall trick of anachronism", i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right about that.
But this does not apply, of course, to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable, and not to what was committed in preschool of adversities and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was usual at that time.
It's all terrible and I'm glad it's finally being reworked.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. slapping his ear and pulling his hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also adhered strictly to it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger give in the discussions with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Did the subject of beating also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, where the cathedral spats played only a secondary role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding absolute discipline, it would have been hardly possible for him to form an institution of world standing from the hitherto more nationally known Regensburg cathedral spats, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and sweets alone, you don't make stubborn boys into great singers and stand before every success, regardless of the field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person have you experienced Georg Ratzinger in the discussions about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced him again and again as wonderful, humorous, profound, deeply believing and heart-loving people, of whom one cannot imagine that he could only hurt a fly.
I regularly get in contact with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family, 23 years after his retirement.
Those who do not forgive him until today that he was once strict with them are therefore clearly in the minority.
Most of the cathedral spats today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that might be - but he was also a lovable person of respect, to whom they still look up today and who they almost worship.
And please, once again, quite clearly, all that is accused of is educational methods that were common at the time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it's highly unfair to make a man a media scapegoat just because he's prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the decency, a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merit and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps still Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, would finally leave in peace.
