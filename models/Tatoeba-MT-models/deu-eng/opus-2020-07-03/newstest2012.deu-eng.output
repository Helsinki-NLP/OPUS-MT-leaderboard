No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today refused to request that, in the context of an amendment to the Criminal Code, the paragraph on which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was convicted be abolished.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned Minister of Expremium, was rejected by MEPs at the second reading of the request for a reduction in the penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for the conclusion of an allegedly negative contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, and the appeal of the convicted is due to be brought before the court in December.
Timoshenko himself described the verdict as a political revenge of the regime, and in the West, too, the trial raised suspicions of the court's bias.
The motion to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Secretary of State was convicted, from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As it is customary for this region to win in the elections Islamists, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council confessed to the customary right of the Sharah, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft one hacks off the hand in short.
Women, too, should forget thoughts of emancipation as soon as possible, any apostasies of faith will be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society from mutually opposing tribes will be united by the Koran in the future.
In short, there will be an order in Libya that would be hard to imagine in this country and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively not the best and would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans.
In this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters let themselves be helped by the unbelieving dogs.
To her excuse may only be the fact that NATO's airstrikes were not led by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in an exchange of fire, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians discharged themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without this having brought any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
Thereby the locals are rid of a worry - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
But do the oil companies get the black gold at a mockery price without occupation?
Hardly and thus the West can at last boast of its selflessness in the protection of human rights.
If this does not destroy for them the Sharah-representatives.
Start of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm broke through Europe.
The individual countries published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France increased.
But today the bond market is breaking all records.
Investors not only keep an eye on Greece, but also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European Zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic developments in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France admitted a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data only referred to stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, the gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Statistical Office, the trend of slowing down economic performance was confirmed.
The results are therefore worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to provisional and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the eurozone as a whole and in the EU, the economy recorded growth of 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is consistent with the analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The return on their 10-year government bonds climbed to 28,45%.
The return on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to its critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The yield on Czech government bonds is below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, voices are heard that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The choice of football has mastered the hardest task of the whole season!
She won 1-0 in Montenegro thanks to a well laid-out goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent goal by Petr Jiráček.
With a great deal of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advantage from the home match and will once again not be missing at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascension game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection won also thanks to the weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro quite happily 1-0 and has thus redeemed their ticket for the football-EM.
Also because of the precise defence match of the Czech team, they could not put the Montenegrin under more pressure until the second half of the season.
The bad luck birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who missed two huge chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will also be part of the European championships next year, and it is also gratifying that a premium of about 200 million will be awarded to domestic football.
From the first minutes, quite combative football was played.
Both teams combined tediously and so was mainly played around the middle line.
Also in the second half the pressure of the home team remained out and the wide tees before the penalty area were successfully resisted by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's core program.
They formed a living shield.
Several hundred university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object Tuesday noon and then announced death to the US and Israel.
On Tuesday, a few hundred students from the University of Isfahan, Iran, formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
They wanted to show that they are willing to protect their country's core programme, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran seems to have long since abandoned its efforts to create a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon in front of the entrance to the complex and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, in the event of an attack intended to paralyze Iran's nuclear program, the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan's target would also be from the centre of Isfahan.
The menu of a fat addicted child: It does not eat breakfast and eats sausage for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have proven that obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important for the healthy development of a human being is the environment in which he grows up and is the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more frequently on the table than in families where normal - weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had fries for dinner on the eve of the educational campaign under the motto "Adiposita is no coincidence".
In families with fat children, sport is not exactly one of the favourite activities, however, as the majority of today's students do - only 15 percent replied that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, with almost 900 children from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic being interviewed.
This was already the second year of the action "Adiposita is not a coincidence", which is supported by the general health insurance company and Unilever.
To date, more than 12 thousand pupils from 4th and 8th classes have participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are key factors that are responsible for the alarmingly rising number of children who are overweight or even obese.
"Only half of the children surveyed mentioned, for example, five times a day, eating breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-vesper dinner in the mode - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that relative small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the pupils' families have breakfast.
And - in most families everyone eats breakfast alone.
The worst was the finding that one in ten families is not having breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey test revealed, among other things, that unhealthy fries are consumed much more often in the families of overweight children.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed are doing sports, only less than half of their parents do so - only 15 percent.
Configure your own menu
Another part of the survey made it possible for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own menu from the options offered for appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite dishes were many flour dishes, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonades", is emphasized in the final report to this survey.
At lunch, i.e. the main dish, pasta won just before poultry.
The children almost didn't like legumes at all and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was also very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In many cases, the survey participants' control group, which completed the questionnaire after the explanatory presentation "Adiposity is not a coincidence", showed a significant shift in preferences towards principles of healthy nutrition", is mentioned in the results of the project.
This was obvious, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed poultry or fish much more often in the questionnaire than the main dish of the day and were ready to eat less dumplings or sweet food.
Pros claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I had managed to learn a little bit that this was a bit too much stuff for the beginning.
I had no idea what was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar about how the "on the square" is going.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the examination comes, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with director Alena (not a single man participates in the course) how to put on a woman who does not have an ideally proportioned figure.
And that's what most of us are.
Some have one too short neck, the others a too young figure without proper curves and yet others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to optically conceal broad shoulders, to lengthen the neck or to conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to put on a female type like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with a big bosom, a wide hip and a narrow waist - pretty and figure-emphasized, without her being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so big that the skirt or pants really don't fit, you should at least have a piece of custom cut.
Surely you will not regret this, because well - seated clothing is simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt you feel much better than in one of the bars that always slips up and down, stands down in the waist, etc.
Young figures can, in turn, allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, building blocks, applications, embroidery or raffling.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet, I'm afraid that given the homework I'm assigned, it's almost impossible to do it.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity for whom she is supposed to think up suitable outfits - day clothes and evening robes.
Here we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
On the inside I juble, because this is much better for me personally than for example to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to a hundred kilos in recent times (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We are supposed to cut the garments out of magazines or search the internet, print them out, and then print them out.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should then be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to concrete specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall view.
The Saturday lecture filled with information about character types was equally seasoned by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit it.
And a stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in quite different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over the jeans as usual, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heel shoes and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to roll up the sleeves or collar and the whole look looks completely different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
The most important advice, however, was the following: "First, you must know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," said Jakub.
Finally, I realize why we have to poke all these phrases, what can be combined with what, and why, even if you often get to see very different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So for a fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten outfits) you have to be prepared to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks completely different than in reality.
So you have to count on all this when designing the outfit.
Jan Pokorný also confirmed that image and style sometimes account for half of the success.
You just need to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also well-known personalities often consider this to be thrown out money (the main thing is that I bring something that I look like is secondary).
And if any of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely force us to have a completely different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google afterwards, in order to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes that the corresponding celebrity has returned to or lost, etc.
On Sunday, Jan and Mario told us not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "to assemble" the outfit.
In his work, he has to communicate with the people he styles, and he has to be a smart psychologist.
Appreciate people without bowing down and agreeing to their opinions.
"If any manager orders us to look at her wardrobe and add nice pieces, then we can't clean out the whole closet and tell her - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to which you recommend what you can carry," says Mario.
He also showed us in concrete terms what a so-called "space bag" must contain.
So it's a bag that you button at the waist and carry with you all the necessary proprieties.
Apart from such clear things as scissors, scrapers for removing hair or safety pins, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips that are used to pick up the clothing at the back if it is too large (plug pins or other clamps are prohibited so that the fabric does not break) and of course sewing gear.
But so that we not only have to listen, but can also try something practical, we learned how to stick shoes properly.
Also when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the shoe sole, let alone the outside.
We were stuck and glued...
With scissors, you can't even touch the shoes so you don't damage them.
So you really have to proceed skillfully.
Mario pleased me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was only a fraction of what we heard at the second weekend course.
One thing has now become clear to me - to devote oneself to styling at a professional level is not a breeze.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree ride is due to a series of completely avoidable, dilettantic mistakes to the routine ride to the early shift.
Although it succeeded in fulfilling the ambitions to a large extent, what good is it if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before he got on the counters, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
He promised to move the old-fashioned game series "Need for Speed" back into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about the fitting passages in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are already used to with NFS, in the end, much is different than you had expected.
Sure - potentially it's quite decent arcade races, but overall, the game is reduced by some superfluous mistakes that have more or less been present in this series for a few years.
So it's actually no longer a mistake, but rather a sign of in principle incomprehensible laziness of game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
First, one is introduced to history, whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you sit on the wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race takes place on a different course and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have a moment the impression that game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are also very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the ride through the desert, through autumnal landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape is visually very pleasant.
Every now and then, untypical elements bring a little variety into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts visibility.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be very careful not to be spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well in a row.
Only a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And that's what the police are doing, trying to screw up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It's more about certain interactive animations in which Jack escapes from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less such passages in the game than one would expect (in fact, only three).
Ultimately, this is more to the advantage of the thing, because this element has at least no chance of becoming boring - it is one of the elements that makes the game more varied in the context of what is said above.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means, as seen from today’s point of view, it does not rip out trees, but on the other hand it cannot be said that it is bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But the local driving model continues to do quite well for action-packed racing, although you could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in order.
Real problems only appear after some time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not quite OK.
From a game of this kind it is hardly to be expected that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no idea before any impact on any object how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: When you overtake or drive by oncoming cars, you "strip" the other cars in some places, but in other, almost identical situations you get into the sling and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the car's going to wreck.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter, it's always annoying.
The restarts are solved like this: if you have total damage or if you land far away from the track, the game throws you back to the last clue of the track.
Only - in every race you only have five restarts.
Once you've exhausted them, everything starts from the beginning.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't succeed, but you shouldn't rely on it.
Sometimes, however, the rest does not help, since nothing else helps to learn the critical section from the head.
Very unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, you have to go through in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't fit through.
Elsewhere, you always meet "civil" cars in the appropriate place in the same configuration, whether you are the first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations where you can see that the opponent passes two oncoming cars in front of a player, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive them around or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed in such a way that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you will always be overtaken in the same place by the same opponent and here again without regard to the time.
The craziest thing to do is to finish the game on the long bridge that you pass in opposite direction.
The opponent obviously has to overtake you here in hell.
And if he is already in front of you, then he takes the view of course, so that you drive your own car there at first a few times in Klump.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly gives you the joy of the game away.
And that's a pity, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and sometimes so action-packed that you almost don't know where your head is.
And in principle it doesn't matter what is "guilty" about it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the change of car during the race.
One must not overlook the gas stations along the route, because it is here that one can change the car, although in most cases the car is sufficient that one has just.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history also goes the task mode (challenges) - i.e. the races in the individual locations that you know from the story.
Here there are not only medals, but also points of experience for the own profile, which is shared for the tasks (challenges) and the history.
In order to reach the higher driver level, various items have to be unlocked: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is simultaneously linked to the online autolog function, which compares, among other things, the results achieved with those of other players and also provides for further collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible carvers is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you come by car into a subway tunnel (because of me), where you race long on the tracks in the dark (because of me).
On the speedometer numbers look between 150 a 200 km/h (because of me), but suddenly there comes from behind a subway and drives one uncompromisingly to scrap.
In our editorial office we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
All the more annoying is that at some exciting moments the refresh rate is slowing down and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this is particularly true of accidents involving a greater number of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound reproduction is OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to reach as broad a scale as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lá "something from everyone" was created - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game were not reduced by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned, we could have said with the breast tone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems unfinished.
A great pleasure in itself, but you should be prepared to see these mistakes with the power of airport lights.
Concert of the "Students of the Velvet Revolution" with singing ensembles of the Karlsuniversität
The Festival Festa Academica now offers for the third time the combination of World Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution and this together with music experience.
In the course of the festival, the twenty specialist and university choirs introduce themselves.
The festival focuses on the two concerts that take place on 17 November.
"The Karlsuniversität has a big share in the festival."
"The choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanistic Studies is also represented among the participants, and the Rector Václav Hampl, among other things, is also on the festival committee," said Jakub Čaloun, head of the organisation team.
The absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of technical school choirs, which takes place on 17 November from 2 p.m. on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
On the program is the composition of the important Czech jazz musician Karel R
In the evening, in the gala rooms of the Volkshaus in Vinohrady, the concert "Students of the Velvet Revolution" (Studenty sametu) takes place, in which also university choirs perform, choirs of the Karlsuniversität not excluded.
Festa Academica sets itself the goal not only to celebrate World Student Day worthy and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present choir music to the public at the highest level and to promote the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organiser is the Association of Czech Choirs in cooperation with the Johannes-Kepler-Gymnasium.
The entire event was sponsored by Bohuslav Svoboda, the mayor of Prague and Václav Hampl, the rector of Charles University.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
In addition to concerts, the schedule also includes numerous music meetings, student Hapanings, Matinees and other events.
Detailed information can be found on the website of the festival www.festaacademica.cz
EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance between the various institutions out of balance."
I didn't expect such a hard war to come to an end."
"It will take five or six years for the waves to settle down and everyone to get used to their new role," said Milena Vicenová, Czech Ambassador to the European Union, and began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
In the first part of her lecture, she showed how seriously she takes the motto "understanding and open about Europe", in which she was able to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have envied many lecturers of the Faculty of Law of the Charles University.
Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At the beginning, criticism became loud, he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who was not up to such a role, but I have to say, it took all the breath away, how well he took care of the matter.
"He is a person who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, communicate with them, and who above all has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards the unification and better readability of EU policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our oil caps Quargels
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived, lived and intended to live in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency two years ago as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and had also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the Presidency was described as a major negative which had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, was quite hectic.
And there is still a need to approve the EU's seven-year budget, which makes things much more complicated precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and economical budget, which sectors of activity will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which will be less - all this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Understanding Europe".
"If I don't like something, it's greyish abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.
How am I supposed to know, as a citizen, whether people in Brussels are really making up their minds or round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes, or whether someone is actually trying to ban us from the quargels?
It would also have liked to use the EU's soil to attract more Czechs to European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics who perceive the negative side rather than the positive side of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is near, then the Frenchman next to me means, "Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is that your V4 again?" and makes a pretty sour face.
According to Ms Vicenové, the EU will expect tough rules for Member States' budget policies in the future.
As much more real, as a "European federation", it sees the concept of a two-speed Europe, or even different speeds.
"Here we have the eurozone countries and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation."
"For the first time it has been said that only the countries that want to work together and those who do not want to work together should stand quietly apart."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately amounts to a strong "Europe of different speeds", expects Vicenová.
In this regard, it also acknowledged the role played by the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues affecting the whole of the EU must be discussed by all member states and not only by the eurozone countries.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to search for a suitable word that characterizes IBM's strategy most accurately, then this would probably be the word "long-term".
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution; it is known as a modern enterprise, although a century has passed since it was founded.
The basis for this longevity was already laid by their first boss - visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Even he argued that countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" thus became a trademark for the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen's thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for an entire century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society in the course of our first century.
We hope that we will do even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Thoughtful system
Watson already in the thirties operated social care of his employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people had as one of the first American employees paid holidays, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a thoughtful remuneration system for best newer and dealer.
IBM's long-term relationships with its customers are equally sophisticated.
From the beginning, the company was brilliant in promoting talent - as one of the first companies in the world IBM lifted any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan that Palmisan will be replaced by a woman at the head of IBM next year - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, and has so far taken on the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations develop.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unwavering position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this to the inside and to the outside.
"From the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a technology company," said Economist, Harvard Business School professor and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies," added George Colony of Consulting-Company Forrester Research.
As the company itself points out, it is a difference to be present on the market only or to shape it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo called "Big Blue" for family reasons, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies in the world - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product width - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM owns the most patents and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most well-known inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes or even the diskette.
IBM was the second largest technology company this year (just after Apple), with a market value of around 220 billion dollars, and it has overtaken Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - for example, the attempt with its own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or the computers IBM PC jr were unhappy.
"Business is based on forward movement, so one must not emotionally bind oneself to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they do not work, they also leave them again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, who basically stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising Technologies
One fifth of IBM's profits are accounted for by services, software and hardware.
In 1990 hardware with a more than fifty percent share was still the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-disposing assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
IBM continues in these investments even after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world like a storm for the first time.
Here, too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the midst of the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that the company IBM survives today's crisis unscathed.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008 and the net profit of the company continues to grow.
IBM's corporate slogan is: everything can be changed - only the values cannot be changed.
This is also why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also overcome the next crisis.
IBM story: From cheese cutter to spaceflights
IBM (International Business Machines), founded in New York a hundred years ago, initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It was not until 1924 that she took the name IBM - originally it was about a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for the later IBM company was the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technologies such as the famous speed card clocks to register the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930, became the architect of this new company.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
This leader then even put the founders of IBM in the shade - Watson's ideas are still based on the company's invincible culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production and distribution of all kinds of machines for trade - from sausage and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four decades Watson managed the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the executive chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM helped NASA fly into space - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture in 1964 - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which set the computer standard of that time, came into the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand it bought the consulting part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business with consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the last three years is the concept of "smart planet".
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in not even planned areas, e.g. to improve the situation in transport and in city administration.
In the retail sector, IBM recently launched the Smart Commerce platform to help retailers run the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Already in 1932 IBM founded a branch in the then Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe at all.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central Office for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and there is also a top team of world-class researchers working on voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become their lover by the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still had the hope that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of her life she has set herself clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová had offered refuge to singer I. Bartošová in her own house, she probably wouldn't even have imagined how this would end with her husband.
When Iveta moved back and forth after 30 days at her insistence, Joseph went immediately with her.
In fact, he publicly confessed that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, and it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile herself with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář Iveta is to leave Bartošová in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have certain ties," said Mrs Rychtářová; but she also said that she had already emotionally separated herself from him and insisted on mutual decency alone.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door for him, so far Josef wears with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues to run, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"I talk to Darina normally, but we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to stop her.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a boyfriend or who she is.
I realize that's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take all responsibility.
The worst female defiances: What about you?
If the men are asked to call some typical female idols, they shake out of the sleeve without exception a few promptly.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we revisit a few unsittees, who let the men flow the blood in the veins?
Shopping
Does their husband accuse them of being addicted to buying?
Do you have to buy at least one brawl a week?
Do you like shopping and can it be a little bit more with promotions?
Then I guess your case is really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping desire half under control.
But hand on heart, which woman can stand to stroll through a clothing store in search of a well-fitting outerwear and not try out all (in all possible colour combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Why don't you think about how many times you've told your husband?
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do you even like me?"
Does that seem familiar to you?
Yeah?
Then I guess you're one of the women who's really obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn't mean you should let go, but many men are allergic to it when your wife is constantly complaining about her appearance.
The stronger gender is in agreement - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly intolerant.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - and this at least twice a week.
If you scold your partner because he tramples again with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, do you scold the children, because the just scrubbed sink is already dirty again and because the glass door at the living room closet has fingerprints again, where the polishing does so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you can't exaggerate anything and that the order and cleanliness in family life are not the top priority.
This excessive purity fickleness can ultimately also harm mutual relationships and, above all, peace in the family.
Stitching
"Smucky gym pants come in the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put on those old socks tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, don't be surprised that it puts him on the palm tree.
Of course that's not meant badly, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to complain so much.
Lapping and gossiping
Some women like to clap and gossip, because behind their backs is muddled or even slandered, or one forges alliances.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to flaunt such issues, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably every one of us women has a little harmless gossip and gossip in store.
Hand on the heart - this is probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with gossips of the grossest caliber, to which nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone in their environment and which pose a considerable danger especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
Jaromír Jágr, who played in the NHL's Monday game with two assistants, played a major role in Philadelphia's 5-3 victory on the ice in Carolina, making him again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases Claude Giroux was the beneficiary of the survey of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star, who added an assistant and was declared the best player of the match.
Jágr's teammate Jakub Voráček also recorded two assistants in the same game.
After the match, Jágr told journalists that he had predicted Giroux a great evening.
"Even before the game, I'll tell him that he's doing a hat trick today."
I kind of felt that."
"There is such a feeling coming across every now and then," explained Jágr, after his action Giroux scored a goal at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráček won the Puck behind the Hurricanes' goal and presented it to the successful Maxim Talbot between the circles.
One second before the whistle of the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short hander, but the second third belonged to the Flyers again.
Specifically Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but I'm sure he's one of the top three," Jágr praised his center.
"I wouldn't have imagined in my life that I'd be playing with such an ice hockey player as with him at the end of my career."
"I'm really happy about that."
"I'm cutting my game at me."
"All these years in the NHL, my fellow players put their game on me and now the tables turn around," Jágr smiled.
Carolina made the game a drama - by the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who prevailed from a penalty shot, it came to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful in outnumbering two against one.
"Excellent Pronger was still active in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I picked up and (Read) pulled to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráček described the last match of the match from his point of view.
This victory put Philadelphia at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the game against Buffalo and retired in the second third due to injury to the upper body.
The Candiens also lost their lead in Penalty shooting 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not turn one of the penalty shots.
More than the lost points hurt the coach of the home team probably the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only with five defense players to the end.
"That's bad."
"We only finished the match with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing we can do, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"At each change one wave of attack after another and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."
There were reserves here," said P.K. Subban, one of the defensive players.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters took part.
Trend in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five approved state travel agencies in the then ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies at that time sold mainly only trips to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, to the West were only allowed at that time select ones.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore the trips to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely within the framework of socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travels were not possible.
Even then the travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but then you had to accept huge queues or also stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, the thing had not gone by yet.
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit to the West - was granted only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to obtain the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West without a foreign exchange commitment.
Thus, the vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend homes and dates - a habit that continues to this day.
The velvet revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries all over the world.
A huge paradox that we are no longer aware of today is the fact that it was impossible to travel to the most popular holiday destination of Czech Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the foreign exchange obligation was lifted to the neighbouring Western European countries, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
For a long time the Czechoslovaks simply could not get enough of their travels to the West, everyone wanted to have been there at least a few days.
So the Czech holidaymakers slept in a tent in the park when traveling to Paris, because who would have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension at the time.
A typical feature of trips abroad from Czechs was a trunk packed with canned food, beer and sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the western currency freely.
Our standard of living and thus also the average salaries increased, which resulted in another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, after 1997 travel agencies began to regularly prepare trips by charter flights, making air travel incredibly cheap, thanks to the possibility of negotiating volume discounts, compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the US, had already had currencyless payments with all the most advanced countries in the world, making travelling even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-official" travel came in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was taken - to Thailand.
Since then, every year direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying to far away sunny countries; this year twelve exotic destinations are flying directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 thousand Czechs travel every year to exotic countries!
Another important moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the USA lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) for the first time and for the first time in their history spent more than CZK 15 per person for a single holiday stay, including the cost of the holiday resort.
The general meeting is to find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has not been a chairman, and the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
To date, there is no agreement on the electoral order to be chosen.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his role, asking his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek the old queers broke out again between the two federation chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clearly demonstrated on 16 September when the new chairman was to be chosen.
The delegates of the general meeting had come to the Volkshaus in the Prague district of Smíchov for nothing, because the negotiation led to no result and it was not only about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full collection - only the statutory representatives or also the functionaries endowed with a power of attorney.
On this only point, agreement was reached at least in part, to which the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law also contributed, whose opinion was that representation on a proxy basis was not acceptable.
However, disputes over the electoral system continue.
Nor did the Executive Committee bring clarity into the matter, at which meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - in principle nothing else is on the agenda.
Even if the views regarding the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round in order to avoid a stalemate situation?
"The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or whether to find a completely different model", Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FAČR, who represents professional football in management, noted.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
Moravia is supposedly prepared to compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers will win.
On the other hand, the Czech side insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote counting.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no meaning at all, this mode would question the whole concept of the two chambers," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would be best not to bend the electoral order, but to choose according to the valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, even if it turns out that the statutory electoral system is most likely to meet Pelta from all candidates.
"My wish is for the majority of the vote to be made according to the statutes."
"So that no absurd substitutes are invented, as at the last Annual General Meeting," explained Victoria Plzeň, the owner of the football club, who ran for the first time and distinguished himself from Pelta in his opinions.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football-EM today would certainly contribute to calming the minds."
"When football first rides on the euphoric wave, the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says the official from Jablonec, who has the greatest experience of all three adepts, at both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambivalent."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "justify" the regulations for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a further blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that common sense will ultimately prevail," Rajchl said.
Only - much time to agree on all sides no longer remains.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the qualifying match.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl among others were to fly to Podgorice, could not start in the morning in Prague because of a technical disturbance at all and so they searched feverishly for a replacement variant, as part of the executive committee to bring nevertheless still to the place of execution of the Barrage-Hinspiel.
Finally, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday, is crucial.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to have led the divided parties within the country's largest sports association to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the trustworthiness of Czech football and the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which is supposed to give Czech sport a new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into the fight for the chairman's position because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner football team, had been able to make up a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have taken part in the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good candidate, I'd fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favourite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that, in the event of his victory, he intends to carry out the role of Chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
"I have spoken personally to some of the people in question."
"It's hard to believe that some people told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly interferes with Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a controversial man who is regarded as a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegates' votes at general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Paclík that Pelta hold the chairperson's position.
"In his victory, today's state would be preserved and there would be no progress at all in Czech football."
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be twice as bad for football," stressed Paclík.
He also points to the fact that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone interceptions to investigate a corruption affair, but out of which Pelta emerged without a criminal offence.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who said his earlier statement that "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman", but sees something more relaxed.
However, if Paclík wins in the Thursday election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
The same is true of another candidate - Rajchl, whom Paclík had supported before the October Annual General Meeting, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could think of him as the head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he's capable of running the association as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters that I don't understand," said Paclík, who had caused a stir in September with the fact that he was in the lead behind the removal of the referee commission with Luák Macela, replacing Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he has grown to the role of president of the association.
And he relies on his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer he has also been head of Pilsen, which celebrated the first triumph in the league with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football milieu and to contribute to some cultivation of it."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which degenerate into disgusting situations," said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy to, for example, the Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby political leaders for more money flowing from the lottery tax to sport.
"This is one of the crucial things the new chairman should devote himself to."
"If there is taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their reasoning, but then they also have to say clearly where the money goes," he said.
Paclík also does not regard his connection to the Pilsner Club as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FAČR must be "superpartial".
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"In my opinion, however, it does not make much sense to hypocritically transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third party in order to return after a year and a half," Paclík explained.
Pelta promised new statutes of FAČR, which would exclude a stalemate situation in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the chairmanship, Miroslav Pelta, promised that, in the event of his election, he would stand up for the FAČR to receive new statutes, which in future exclude disputes over the electoral system from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly defuse if the Czech election succeeds.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would concentrate on the national team and the raising of funds in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting and so the two-month break helped him to defend his ideas about the management of football and to present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels devote themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association was led by someone, says the man, who is mainly connected with the Jablonecer Club, but who also worked for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee.
For this reason, too, he believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are caused by the euphoria that prevailed in the days of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, the Annual General Meeting in June approved statutes that were not as perfect as all had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September," said Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the citizens' association that he used as a lure for the delegates.
"If I should become chairman, I will accept it personally and I am willing to bear personal responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a matter of principle without which he cannot be," says Pelta.
In addition, he does not try to distinguish himself from his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognized for his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
Also Tomáš Paclík he did not attack for a long time, who in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football, he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"His attacks, however, were humiliating and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"For this reason, too, many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed to his opponent, who probably remains faithful to his proclamations, which he had already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest playing classes to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all the affairs - from the Causa Bohemians to the echoes of last year's corruption scandal."
"Right after that, I would rush into negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for all football," said the forty-six-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean any human cleansing.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, there is understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the upcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If really the only controversial point is how to vote in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"Football needs credibility and it will only win it back if it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the potentially decisive day of his official career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the former vice-chairman Jindřich Rajchl were to be elected as the new chairman of the Czech Republic Football Association at the general meeting on Thursday, this would supposedly put a lot of people in the association at risk.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his election.
He wants to introduce system changes and hold the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and otherwise continue the work that previous president Ivan Hašek started.
"As chairman, I want to devote myself to football as a whole."
From international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, professional football, to performance football for young people."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member devotes himself to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that football progresses with miles in every segment."
Many would not be delighted about this, because instead of criticising the work of others, they would now have to start working really hard themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he considered not to run at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, who don't constantly throw clubs between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"But many people told me that I should not give up because otherwise others would."
"That's trust you can't lose," he said.
He is also said to be motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years, we've done a great deal of work and I don't want to throw that away."
"Procedures have been launched that probably only come into effect in a few years, and I would hate to see them stopped," he said, expressing his concern that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - was elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Behind him are people who would make football so that he would only be there for the chosen."
I can be accused of some things, but not of being partial."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone is fine and not just the chosen one," Rajchl noted.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible thing for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which would then each rise to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Since the head of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclík has now joined the fight for the role of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I have a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-chairman and now recognizes that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who also regards the savings of tens of millions of kroner for unprofitable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the bandage does not pull together.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to give Czech football new confidence", he considers the second rival - Paclík as a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, he would probably continue with the things Ivan Hašek has initiated, and he would obviously not change the staffing of the commissions in principle."
He certainly wouldn't want to turn things in his favor," Rajchl says about his rival.
Europe’s Most Beautiful Pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Paddling pool in UFO-Optik, Punkpools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike, rest their tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a research trip over the past one and a half years, one thing in her luggage was not to be missed: her swimsuit.
Lying back on the water, she looked up in artistically designed domes, swam towards marble dots waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
If she liked a bath, she took it flying into her notebook - including interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historian Meder in this way - and now presents her in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "journey to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
She doesn't have much to do with sports, says Meder - it's only in the water that it's different.
Only annoying is that swimming fans have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can breathe in the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful bird chirping in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Spätscher in the diving pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all senses are served, says Meder.
And if the builders have made an effort, swimming halls can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in baths."
"On the one hand it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format illustrated book "Badefreuden" conveys on 190 pages interesting facts about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oasis - but above all makes you want to jump into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found a nitrate-containing water in a rustic karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: while you have an eye on the whole city from the Zurich rooftop bath, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can observe the hustle and bustle on the ski slope.
The perhaps most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
It steams from three bowls open to the top in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal protrude into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool did the pool collector Meder get the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so strongly of heating oil, which one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing medicinal water, which is almost black and whose slick sticks to your skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: When she wanted to visit the free and sunbathing in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a closed-off terrain.
The bathroom, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
When Meder took a look through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, one has counteracted the decay in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of the construction of this bath are already behind it; one can discover not only neo-Roman elements that date back to the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because it originally comes from the Black Forest.
"It is already an achievement to merge such different architectural styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is obviously only secondary.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank highlights raw material business
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the CEO then wants to draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of Germany, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges push up prices - and the banks therefore bear a joint debt to the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to protect traders against price fluctuations.
But by now most experts agree that the Zockers have decoupled from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to examine the allegations and said that no business was "worthy to jeopardize Deutsche Bank's reputation".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit is expected to be completed by the end of the year, and the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Management Board - including a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the head of the bank then wants to report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann tinkers with his image
Foodwatch CEO Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "Betting at rising food prices shows particularly drastically how ruthlessly banks today are damaging the general good."
As the top banking lobbyist, Ackermann is now particularly committed.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with people suffering from hunger or with Deutsche Bank's reputation."
At first glance, Ackermann's insight comes as a surprise, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Chief Executive will not change to the Supervisory Board unlike planned.
By turning away from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible losses, he hardly needs to care - his successor would have to do with it.
One in two would terminate raw material plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Thus, just eleven percent believe that it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities for betting on food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: According to the survey, one in two would terminate all investments in which money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would discourage acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said thinking about quitting their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with highs, lows and happy ending: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and decayed.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
When modern post-war architecture is enthused by clear shapes, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Tacker is a fitting and famous example for the 1958 Brüssler World Exhibition.
At that time, Tacker's pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel-glass construction.
Construction is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built Austria's pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like side building in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been erected, rebuilt and opened in 1962 as a museum of the 20th century after the world exhibition in the Swiss garden at the Wiener Südbahnhof - the "20s house" was called.
However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls to hang the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called the "21s House" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, has completed the new start.
Husslein-Arco, art historian with a considerable career, among other things in youth as a figure skater, later with Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, carried out the reconstruction of politicians and conservationists, procured public funds and private sponsorship funds and determined the use.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there was to be a café and a bookshop, and an office building had to be built for it.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation for the implementation.
Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Tacker at the Technical University of Vienna and because the pavilion was an "unfortunately important place" for him, where he had watched the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost its generosity and ease when he moved to Vienna and re-used it.
There were far greater problems with the current reconstruction: The building was "an energy spinner," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, glass fibre reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements brought space for the new use, a lowered moat of light between house and street provides the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old reddish-brown anti-rust colour tone.
And the cinema is still exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the monument protection office," says Krischanitz and points to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and modifications, the building has remained flexible and light.
It was difficult with the pavilion "which came from Brussels", Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21er Haus is not in the wrong place, because an urban developmental stroke of luck has occurred: Around the Swiss garden, the completely newly planned "Central Station Quarter", with office and residential buildings, is created.
And another stroke of luck may still occur: The 21er Haus could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and as you can hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package in millions
The railway has devised a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It'll cost millions.
According to a newspaper report, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros in the fight against winter-related train failures and delays this year.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance on the basis of an internal crisis plan that by 2015 total investments of around 300 million euros had been planned.
The aim was to improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees for snow removal on railway facilities and platforms to 16,000 people.
The goal is to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operations and 90 percent of the necessary turnouts.
Two months ago, after a top meeting with government and industry, Bahn CEO Rüdiger Grube had warned of train failures and delays this winter as well.
Last winter, the railway had considerable problems in passenger transport, as it lacks reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
For years, the railway has also been making it possible for it to have axes of ICE trains tested much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE had an axis break at Cologne's main station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the USA
After the tumult of boss Josef Ackermann, new trouble comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million dollars there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now catching up with his past in the US: The Frankfurt Institute is paying 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of large banks of having led cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they have played down the risks.
During the financial crisis, such papers lost their value and tore the banks into the depths.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not acknowledge any guilt with the settlement.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to paying $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the two monetary institutions' approach.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US cooperative banks and intervenes in bankruptcies to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA tries to get the resulting billion-dollar damage replaced.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also taken over other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called Mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the US real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became a disaster for a large number of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers flipped over.
Even if the events were a few years ago, there is a sharp wind in the US at the moment.
Investors and supervisory authorities have brought countless lawsuits in order to obtain redress or to punish misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of having taken advantage of two state-owned US real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in mortgage transactions worth about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also faces a lawsuit from FHFA, which deals with several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurters stand straight for "substantial losses", without, however, giving an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with 10 billion
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought more than ten billion dollars worth of shares.
Until now, the major American investor Warren Buffett had always explained not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of companies can only be forecast poorly.
However, he had now read IBM's annual reports and changed his mind about investments in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily providing services and providing computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight's strike in the financial world.
As a result, IBM is now allowed to call itself "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now revealed in the US business channel CNBC that he has purchased $10.7 billion of IBM shares since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus become one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known anything about the engagement so far.
He praised the management, which had provided even in the economic crisis for decent profits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for quite some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as high-performance company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies so far.
He says he invests only in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett joined a freight train, for example, a lubricant manufacturer or mechanical engineer.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 subsidiaries and shares in a number of large companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Municher Rück.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and developed it with clever investments into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
That's why he's a cult figure for countless investors all over the world.
His almost indelible sense of making money has earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the Buffett investment became known, the IBM share increased by one percent on a pre-exchange basis.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock market, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world together with Apple and Microsoft.
But he doesn't want to join Microsoft, Buffett said.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell" Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which is now revived.
The murders of eight Turkish-born and a small Greek entrepreneur between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
In Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany, this news is met with fear and concern.
For many German Turks, a ghost long believed to be dead returns: since the attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks.
Nevertheless, the fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the revealed right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology revived?" headlined the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators is said to have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities may also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany reacted calmly: on the weekend it reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish Agreement on Recruitment.
It had been staged in cheerful colours - as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media seems like a slap in the face: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth" is the headline of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which presents the background of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken away from this mental connection.
"It's starting to stink," is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that people had been murdered who had paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, the action of the police and their later search success is discussed extremely critically.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not even think of looking for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some people, at least rhetorically, are prepared to resort to drastic means: "If we continue to slurp here, the migrants have no choice but to defend themselves and arm them."
"This will probably be the best self-protection."
"The goodness of the enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the inner peace in Germany," writes Selenium.
What it means when inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s made clear.
The photo of the fire ruin of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the "we-feeling" on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
At that time, the Turkish press criticized the failure of German politics after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the arson attack of Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President, but at the funeral ceremony in Cologne he was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel listed in his speech how many charges the local Turks paid.
It is as if a person’s value is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many Turkish Germans in the local rule of law has been since then.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive education and reassessment of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The scandal bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is located not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slid from one crisis to the next.
Now let a German judge it.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would start a nearly equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss large bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber was delighted publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its new solidity and dropped friendly comments about future colleagues.
"UBS has done the turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But already in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A dealer at UBS in London had bypassed all the bank's security systems and gambled around EUR 1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only praised in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has also been considered to be beaten - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally arrive?
It has already been announced that Weber will be able to advise the Bank from February 2012.
And he already takes over the Chairmanship of the Board of Directors in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
It's gonna be tough for Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, he's a professor of economics and a central banker, and he certainly would've had a time to get started.
At one stroke, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven once again that it has long earned the title of "Europe's largest scandal bank".
Because UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand it has been sliding from scandal to scandal for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
It began in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She combined the image of the secretive and solid Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: She also wanted to become a huge number in investment banking.
On the one hand, UBS managed more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world with 1.6 trillion dollars in 2007.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it had advanced into the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-standing bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger tells: "At the time, I always presented UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, how could I be so wrong?"
He was so wrong.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something went wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, Chief Executive Officer, resigned surprisingly, who was previously regarded as a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker.
A few months later, one knew why he had left.
The bank's investment business had been messed up with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
In order to shoulder this, UBS announced a capital increase of just over 13 billion Swiss francs.
For this she actually found investors, but those about which some people would have scolded their noses until shortly before: an intransparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund, which was so silent that you didn't even know his name.
But that was only the first blow.
It got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billions losses, Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, who was still the second best paid Board of Directors in Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS was facing collapse in the face of its misinvestments in the financial crisis and had to be saved by the state.
The SNB bought UBS for tens of billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion Swiss francs for a compulsory convertible bond through which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS in 2007 was more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"Once again, we could not save UBS," says banking researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
Just a few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who may have evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including fines.
Thus UBS more or less openly acknowledged that it had helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
In a matter of months, the bank lost credibility in both key business areas: investment banking through misspeculation and asset management through tax evasion.
And just when things got a little quieter again, just when you thought the UBS would be able to do it again, this unfortunate dealer story follows: A single dealer gambles 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it turns out that risk management in investment banking is still not working.
"With the Adoboli case, one has found that the risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The CFO of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem with UBS is that it has no control over risk control."
But it was precisely the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago begun to become guardians of the great fortunes of the world: not too great risks, but security for the money - even beyond the Alpine Republic the world might collapse.
The vaults of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the dignified Swiss private bank - it is only a bit bigger.
Even the location is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the store rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
You enter the UBS reception hall through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are marble-clad, in front of them are thick leather armchairs, beside the bank logo a large sign to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
Both Swiss major banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have, however, eventually supplanted this idea of the Swiss bank - or betrayed how the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds it.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two major banks.
UBS had become far too big, he found - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing to say there.
"And if they do, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it high profits, and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the Subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion Swiss francs or around 45 billion euros were granted by politicians to save the large bank that was facing bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem above all in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks joined forces to form a huge group.
A bank was created that was already too big for small Switzerland during the merger - and continued to grow.
In doing so, it helped to complement the two different predecessor banks of UBS: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalised bank.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers got a lot of money to turn a huge wheel with.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors at the time.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest, who understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man, who has worked his way up from bank teaching to the very top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: Exuberance came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, on which Group CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: To push Goldman Sachs off the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go, to the top.
She had already managed to take a few steps.
In the foreign exchange business and in stock trading she played at the top.
Business consultants who were commissioned, however, highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banker's language "Fixed Income", there was a huge gap with the largest banks.
UBS had gaps in American mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that cost her almost the existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime assets.
It developed into a huge machine that packaged and passed on securities on American mortgage loans, but also retained risks.
Also, when other banks were looking for exit long ago.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there," says banking expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to leave when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than expected.
Postings at UBS became a spin seat and are still wobbly today.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all the obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: stop investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has prevailed: he is supposed to run UBS's business permanently, the Zurich bank informed on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the mid-1990s.
He's painting 3500 places.
That's not gonna be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is probably already asking himself.
So far, he has only publicly said that he and his wife will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe plagues US stock exchanges
The impending recession in Europe has taken the US investors to the start of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained unbeaten.
The reduced industrial production on the continent suffocated hopes for a stabilization of the debt crisis in the bud.
The general relief of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week the Italian and Greek glass was considered half-full, not half-empty - but now the problems have come to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Most of the financial assets were on the sales notes.
The Dow-Jones index of the defaults was down 0.6 percent at 12,078 points at the close of trading.
In the course of trade, the market barometer varied between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, a down of one percent.
The index of the technology exchange Nasdaq lost 0.8 percent and went out of trade with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax said goodbye with a minus of 1.2 percent with 5985 counters.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is facing the end of the upswing.
In September, enterprises produced two per cent less than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
The US investors were skeptical about this: "We're not an island, we're dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe would not be able to free itself from recession so quickly, and there would also be further signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything possible to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
It is therefore too early to invest in European government bonds or banks from his point of view.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade-old principle over the pile and entered the US technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional group and initially let it write down just under one percent higher against the trend in the course of trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at 187,35 dollars.
Buffett has paid an average of 170 dollars per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
At 2.6 percent, shares of the Bank of America fell significantly more than the market.
The house silvered out almost the rest of its shares in the China Construction Bank, including $6.6 billion.
With the net profit from the business, the institution wants to primarily cushion its capital ratio and thus comply with tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The share won 1.5 percent after the Group had collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777 aircraft on Sunday and estimated the value of the order to be $18 billion.
Including options for 20 more machines, the volume is even $26 billion.
On the New York Stock Exchange, approximately 710 million shares changed hands.
719 values increased, 2281 declined and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq sales of 1.38 billion shares closed 630 in the plus, 1913 in the minus and 82 unchanged.
Smart crows spread in cities
In many places, crows are considered "problem birds": But the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, say experts.
Some like it, others want to get rid of it very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many communities local complaints about the dirt and noise of animals are accumulating.
A remedy against the "problem birds" is not in sight yet.
Seed crows were no longer to be taken out of the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian void.
There, experts from all over the federal territory discussed possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in cities
Nature conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the rural exodus of the specially protected sows: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional habitats.
Hunting, growing cultivation and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs exist in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the district had caused negative headlines.
Critics had described the capture of the animals in bird traps and the killing with clubs as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the burial, doesn't work," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer noted.
Nests spray away with water or fall trees often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals escape, large colonies split up and spread out in other places."
Burial is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
A combination of burials of animals from sensitive living areas and lock offers is conceivable in order to resettle them in other places.
"Info boards instead of chainsaws" on the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens promoted a completely different way of dealing with the animals: "After all, we can best endure a pimple on the face with confidence."
Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberg Krähen educational trail in Schleswig-Holstein, on which signs inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed crows not only use aids to get a treat, but even make their own tools as a tool.
Behavioural researchers at Cambridge University recently tested on four crows how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that with stones they had to bring a scaffold to collapse in order to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determined what size and shape a stone must have in order to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the smart crows had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid wire pieces for them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket at the handle from the tube.
Three of the four crows even managed to do this right away.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup failed.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland are at the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have released the last tickets for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.
Leading by the double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd) Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and after the 0:0, made the fifth European Championship participation in a row perfect.
The Czechs had a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off back match with outsider Montenegro, after the round (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
Croatia also had nothing to burn at the 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland brought a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other hits for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trade meter (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa against Portugal.
Portugal made a tailor-made start at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo chased a free kick from about 30 meters to the early lead into the meshes.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his wide shot qualities and hit 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by goal hunter Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger of the English leader Manchester City put a headball on the lower edge of the slat, but the ball did not exceed the goal line (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Subsequently, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was the focus.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penal chamber, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other side, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic certainly transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-European Champion made it all clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time in a row that the European Champion of 1976 has won the European Championship.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to survive a second of shock in the beginning.
Finalman Petr Cech with a reflex at the last moment prevented a possible own gate by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic just missed the goal of Cech in the 40th minute from the turn from the penalty limit.
After the break, the cross bar had to save the Czechs for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper, again the striker of the FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The gate just before the end finally made everything clear.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to leave almost certainly his place on the bench of the World Cup third of 2002, the Croats can look forward to their fourth participation in a final round of the European Championships.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
Selcuk Inan only hit the post in the seventh minute with a distance shot, assailant Kazim Kazim could not sink the crasher in the goal.
After the second of terror, however, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made place for Ivan Perisic from Dortmund from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were in action.
Trapattoni goes to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision in the 32nd minute with the 4-0 win.
Constantine Vassilyev (57.) balanced for guests.
Ireland pushed up the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment the Estonian back team prevented the possible lead hit.
But in the 32nd minute it was time.
After an accident at the club, Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to 1-0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
The Dax Group announced on Tuesday that around two billion dollars (around 1.5 billion euros) will be invested by 2015.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and hire staff accordingly," announced Co-Chief Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from around 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the global leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far SAP has been present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the world's more than 176 000 SAP customers are located in Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP plans to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers had redeemed around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is almost rarely done before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," explained McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China through comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horror. A Story of the First World War, narrated in nineteen destinies" begins with a long list of the main characters that you have to heart.
Here's a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You'll get to know these people very well in Englund's romantic narrative, and these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when, like Englund's men and women, you are lost in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not describe wrongly as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It's about "feeling, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flickers up like the votive candles in a church, some of them are added while others are extinguished.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war of position on the Western Front.
"Beauty and horror" wanders with expert views over other war locations: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are covered by beehives, one celebrating Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is almost a moving book from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that smells of Kordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's at home with her children and hears gunfire in the distance.
Who's coming anyway?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged.
"Failing facts," Englund notes, "were mutilated with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Horror" is followed by individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other previously published material.
Their life stories can be frightening or poignant, but they are extremely alive in Englund's details-losing collection of small moments.
Many of them are concerned with lack and help.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the replacement dinner in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and last served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes filled with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own desire for savagery and says about the war: "One feels that despite everything that was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in his hand, and pretending that such a façade means civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind his own strengthened and stubbled shirt breast."
On the other hand, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die and that no one will take notice of it or take care of it.
"If you take away from the idea of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe falling apart and about new forms of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century": "the word skillful and ideologically convinced mass murderers in a tailor-made suit who slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseen way and there are just as frivolous behaviors as there are heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to contaminate a prostitute with a venereal disease to escape the frontline service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonococcal pus, because soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital like this," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, which led to them being blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes supple yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war unleashed "uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People begin to wonder why their leaders make them fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly falsified like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West nothing new" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I have ever read in a non-fiction book.
I won't give it back.
But it's like he grabbed this page with the main characters in front of us with his book and lit it with a match.
After an early failure, a minutely planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
They had chosen the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there were hardly any people in the Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed, and everyone else initially believed to be taking part in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was in the midst of them and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and gave the squatters an enormous increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by watching how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials stepped up the so-called chaos training - counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," someone who is familiar with the orders said, what a declaration as "exercise."
"The few police officers involved, to my knowledge, did not know that it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was the Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to vacate the park, but then withdrew when hundreds of protesters came together after they learned about these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in Tuesday’s operation, including operations from across the city — hundreds of mobile officials who are usually deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people enter and leave the park, almost like commuters, so 1 o'clock at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do so when the smallest number of people are in the park," he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before the departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages that roared from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their light-blue wind jackets, many protesters simply gathered their things together and left the place.
The police said that no tents would be touched until 1:45 a.m. to give the protesters time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police president, said this had happened for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the staff were very rough.
Mr. Browne said that TV vans on Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken photos.
When the police moved westward through the big mess of the protesters' personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial grass and bags with clothes, their employee followed the town cleaning, who picked up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main nucleus of protesters moved in near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some established barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp joined their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them loose.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
According to the police, the evacuation was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests, as he said, were due to "inordinate conduct and resistance to arrest."
The most prominent official on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the police department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not lead the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were built in Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south.
It could be observed how from these locations the police extended the perimeter further and further around Zuccotti Park.
In one place, it was observed that several officials, many of them with shields, drove people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Warden's union will file a lawsuit against the city for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of school workers who have lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the dismissals are not necessary and discriminatory because of their undue influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last opportunity left for the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, supervisors and other staff, who were among the worst paid employees in the city and had lost their jobs in a move on 7 October, described the union leader as a political revenge for refusing access to a health fund that the working groups maintained last year to close the household gap.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing with the city council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the dismissals were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the city council shot back and told him that nothing specific in the budget would be that staff of the school helper would be released.
City Council 37 officials said they had and warned the Department of Education of a lawsuit. On Wednesday there will be a press conference at which the filing of the lawsuit is formally announced before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will accuse Mr. Walcott and the city's Ministry of Education and will count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the city's Ministry of Justice, said that the city was not in charge of the lawsuit, and therefore the individual claims of the city could not be commented on.
According to a draft lawsuit filed by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in the city's poor districts to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfunded.
She explains that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and only a few layoffs in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn lost and 46 helpers were released in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the finding of the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed in public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint states: "This is not a neighbourhood of bereaved parents who can organize donations to absorb budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was reduced by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, funds were lost when the city changed its method of calculating extra funding for each poor school enrolment.
The union also complains that the heads of high schools were misled by the language in a memo approving the dismissal of the supervisors.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the plot, even if "excess" (translating) in the USA usually describes the change of a teacher from a school payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Six-six-six coordinators were dismissed, not transferred," says the complaint.
Mission over, Congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, it seems that Republicans and Democrats are already in Washington to agree on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate International Relations Committee will adopt a resolution under the chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for its successful rebellion and US troops for its "mut".
"This resolution honours the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of two parties for their democratic efforts."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, legislators from both parties and the White House argued about the wording of a number of resolutions approving or disapproving the role of the US military in NATO's Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution approving the restricted use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe group of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this law passed in the Senate. Moreover, the Chamber overruled a resolution to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the US mission got into some kind of legislative purgatory - with a congress that was upset enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not angry enough to pull the ground under his feet for good.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell among the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya on their enormous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "promises the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners, who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Board or will they divide the legislators, as the June law did?
The final version meets the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee's top republican.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional legislature of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the direction of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change of the budget or any other area that is currently coming to the vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlatte's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional changes that have been presented to this Congress and cover a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law has been submitted to both Congress and the Senate - others differ only slightly.
There are at least 15 versions of the balancing budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners from the Republicans who want to polish their CV - the opportunity to boast that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, adopted in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in Budgetary Compensation.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit on two terms of office of the President.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage among same-sex individuals, as well as a change that prohibits the burning of flags, is a recurring template.
Some legislators also want to make it possible to repeal federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As eager as the members propose changes, they move as much faster as in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators presented 77 such amendments.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today’s.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Affected, but not defeated," says Giffords in the first TV interview after the assassination
Ten months after an armed man shooting at her at a nearby election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night. She sang to Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" alone and said that the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to Congress.
When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she struggled for words and needed help walking.
The show showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet that divided her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to give a triumphant voice to the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, in which six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied, "Very well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special recorded shortly before the couple's new book was published: "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The Special has been pursuing Gifford's recovery since the January 8 assassination attempt.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, she was seen in the hospital bed, shaved bald head, and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how she performs simple movements.
A nod with your head.
A twitch with your lips.
And then, her first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word, "Toast." She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: you can see the congressmen singing together with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours of therapy every day, said that she can't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said that on March 12, he had read an article from a daily newspaper about the attack when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the attack.
The alleged shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, is in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly treated for medical treatment while waiting for his trial.
"Many people died," Giffords Sawyer said.
"Hart, hard, hard."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"Well, I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated?" said Kelly.
You were just hit.
And you're gonna get through this and you're gonna recover and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel pity rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him on a cue.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising campaign in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, who was observed, among other things, by the Chief of Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, it wasn't.
The blatantly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops will be heaped with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, say servants.
The public is increasingly acting as if the people in uniform were hurting her.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The subject is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public to whom they serve.
They have also realized that the anger that the returning troops have met in the last years of the Vietnam War has been far worse.
As a result, there are talks about compassion in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe, as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "happy, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over an elevated post in Washington upon his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the questioners subtly asked if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the fight.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian explained to his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the Americans' lack of interest in the war.
Performances on the battlefield are rarely taken out as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it was absolutely normal during World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a servant.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-interference in a rape in the military court.
If this does not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and was 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could take her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texan woman wiped away her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my gut."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously waiting for a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a lawsuit brought against the former Defense Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admitted to court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not take action against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional right of the soldiers.
In February, filed by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially comprised 17 plaintiffs, but rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men all claiming that they were raped or sexually abused by soldier colleagues, and that the military failed to investigate, condemn or provide adequate justice according to the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's on top of the military as the problem starts there.
"The military is hierarchically structured," she says.
"Who are the individual persons who are in the position to eradicate the culture's retaliation? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February, she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors, many of whom may be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by state attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
The files of the court that Newsweek has before it state in detail the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries that have occurred in the armed forces.
Under a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the military service of the plaintiffs", says the document.
The Department of Defense refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles in both Iraq and Afghanistan, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: 150 soldiers died between these two wars, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to be modernized, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her fight: three more lawsuits besides hers are pending.
At Yale Law School, Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four main military academies for alleged promotion of an anti-woman atmosphere.
Independently of this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is collecting a lawsuit against the military focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that rape victims received to release them from service - a common practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration in which she accused her discriminatory practice of dealing with claims for benefits for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in service.
Nine laws were submitted to Congress independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, which provide a number of clues.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Ministry of Defence, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported.
However, most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure accounts for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur every year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases covered were brought to court in the military, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole series of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, who came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, who was asked about the sex she had with her boyfriend before the attack.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day when the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the labors were going to start. I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They took me to the psychiatric ward, and I remember when I came out, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his trial. That was my trial."
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her incapacitated.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably released, so she does not receive any support.
Whether the lawsuit filed by Lyman and the other plaintiffs is progressing is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes, "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I'm a Feres Doctrine critic all my life.
The military lags a decade behind, for they do not have the same incentive and deterrence that liability entails.
He adds, "The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will start with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until there are reforms," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers observe you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who broadcast their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed an amok run in Norway in July, killing 77 people, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time before his attack in front of his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on the side of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
That's easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We found that it was not difficult to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding of personal data is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers simply have to use the site's advertising tool to precisely define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of far-right groups all over Europe and then targeted them with add-ups, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking about their educational level, attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters of 14 very right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office once.
"It's a quite new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online supporters of right-wing extreme groups are mostly young, male and annoyed about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more rational, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends such as "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding three content per day on average, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating a research boom that has increased the number of scientific work with the name of this page in the title by almost 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study people through this page that you normally cannot reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and they had never allowed them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook, it all falls away - you go straight to them."
Others say that the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues has found that students who discussed their frenzy on Facebook tend to drink problems significantly more than students who were silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that peer students, such as residential consultants, monitor the site and help a student if they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook also constantly taps into the data of its own population.
The site's data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the 2010 mid-elections, and a national lucky index (primarily using data that only Facebook has access to - masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data repository accessible to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want to do so or not. To play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to share your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know anything about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online everything is allowed.
"I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, on a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the data in a user profile and in contributions are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research has to take care of the social - and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
"Cold and inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears in a public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood two amok runs in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight in Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I do not confess guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform where he could express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had a pre-written speech, to turn to the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, that he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he was behind the lock and the bolt.
Everyone took part with the aim that everything would end up in a lockdown.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I have seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and seemed calm and professional throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered the building and left.
Despite Breivik's bizarre suggestion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not insane and said that there was no proof that he had accomplices.
It may please some that the attacks of July 22 were apparently the work of a single extremist and not of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said a victim's family member.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theatre this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him with Henry Ford, highlighting the technical genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing in the recently rediscovered job interview, which was dedusted this week before special film screenings in the important markets, is how much this creative head understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who eagerly tinkered with diagrams - a man who believed that many managers suffer from "a disease of thought," "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995 Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Professional Idiots" about the departure of the personal computer. And he sat with jobs for more than an hour, in which they had one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company, NeXT, and was looking forward to the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in technical idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing during delivery.
Only after Job's death was a complete VHS copy discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which is coming to the Landmark Theater this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to abhor extensive interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four times longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which jobs clearly weigh up their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments in which Jobs' perfectionism comes to light when he seemingly impatiently responds to Cringely's questions and encourages him to respond more quickly to issues or side-actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone recorded, the Lost Interview appears somehow uncannyly farsighted when jobs are assessed, what other companies do right or wrong in their opinion and represents their own vision of the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthumous appreciations of career jobs. But seeing jobs here as the eager dreamer who is on the leap to grandeur is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"All these years in business, I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues its efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Stunned by how costs were recorded - mostly with "standard costs", which were calculated on a mere assumption and which were then adjusted with "deviation", he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the business costs could be determined down to the smallest.
How the Pope was fooled:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could sneak into the telephone company and make long-distance calls for free.
Much has already been written about the device, but Jobs enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment, is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while grinding through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things around the globe half a dozen times, and when you snarled into the phone, it came out in the phone next door a minute later," says Jobs giggling.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
Both of us, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson, and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious prank that Wozniak and he almost pulled when they called the Vatican in the middle of the night via Blue Box and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they were able to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic Hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with the technique (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"That had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brownish tube, and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for her.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he installed some boards, a customer asked him to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment deadline of only 30 days and had to think about both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later on at Apple, he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember striking arguments... They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About large companies that are slowing down:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs anticipated the ways that so many industrial giants with their visions got into stumbling blocks and lost control of their stocks.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copier or printer, so what?"
They own the share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [they are such people] that ultimately lead the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is necessary by the people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products, exterminated - craftsmanship.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times taller if that could have been Microsoft of the 1990s...
They got the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about your subtleties.
You have to vote, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
In the end, it boils down to taste, it boils down to trying to deal with the best stuff that people have created, and then trying to bring these things together into what they do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, steal great artists.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
Had it not been for the computer industry, they would have created fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws, accepted as court case
On the day that the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically divided question of whether to listen to a challenge to President Obama's health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the law firm that the case would be represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care, which was passed last year by Congress, a law that became a buzzword among conservative activists across the US.
The judges agreed to the hearing. Indeed, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, the likely outcome of which will probably boost the 2012 presidential struggle, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the law must be overturned will probably be Paul Clement, once a general prosecutor under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's firm, Bancroft PLCC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the federalist society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the Dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the law.
Another sponsor was Pharmaziegigant Pfizer Inc., which is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court had discussed the case.
Among others, Mitch McConnell, head of Republican faction in the Senate and a declared opponent of health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending federalist society events for years.
And that's not against moral rules.
In fact, judges free themselves from the code of conduct governing the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge can participate in charity events law near and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms associated with the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, were enough to alert moral and government activists.
"This amazing break with morality and the contrary to the code is a lie to the lawsuits of some judges, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and did dinner during a benefit event with lawyers with pending proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support of a fundraising campaign for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they mix court matters too easily with groups guided by the agenda, such as federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a U.S. Attorney General under the Obama administration when the first legal challenges came to court in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from hearing the case for bias, as she was too involved in defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan does not make any institutions to do this.
Boeing draws record order of 18 trillion dollars ashore
Airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777 dual-mode aircraft with an option for 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It's really a rare news that a company gets an order for over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft totals a record $18 trillion.
The principal of Boeing is equally unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that Middle East airlines will need $450 trillion worth of $2.520 in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order of all time for commercial aircraft on the weekend, based on the value of the order: 50 dual-mode Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
In addition, Boeing announced in 2011 at the Dubai Air Show that it has an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, which will increase the total list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, stockbroker of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil producing countries.
So they don't just have the money to pay the planes, but an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important as they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders as oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"They have a natural protection," he said.
The appointment of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position in the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep Airbus' rival SAS in check, which attacks supremacy with the A350.
Boeing's victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the launch of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed in order to gain more confidence after customers had demanded a higher payload and range.
The Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealer Fausto Vallejo of the PRI supported in the race for the governor's post.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister apparently lost her application for governorship of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, won the race for the governor's post in the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls ... they occupied election booths, built roadblocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just beaten Claderon, who had led the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current governor, came to third place, a severe defeat for the split and unfortunate left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links with drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and amphetamines.
It is President Calderon's home country and he chose Michoacan to launch a military offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still continuing.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have quit the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how vile the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who will probably represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will make us look bravely into next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
Asia’s Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to help rescue the eurozone in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow Asia’s economy’s growth.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must do "everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) who are "dispassionately" looking at the difficulties in Europe, and said that Asia's financial support for European leadership and European resources helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe’s monetary union has been in a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe fueled fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls for the leading emerging economies to join forces to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - would give European partners in Asia greater bargaining power.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from declining exports and the drying out of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an assignment, because where else can we find work for our millions of young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no reason to help rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University, said that it would be very difficult politically to sell aid to the 1.2 trillion people in India for Europe, of whom more than 800 million live out of $2 or even less a day.
"Sometimes they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then they have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used to keep in Greece the numerous and well-paid employees in the public service, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railroad.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the eurozone will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The forecast of the ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011 / now threatens "the risk of gradation" due to the imminent danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets need to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant capital drain of their vocabulary.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible incisions in the defense system
Defense Minister Leon Panetta heated the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the war locations in Afghanistan and the civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of $450 trillion over the next decade, but is now afraid that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress is unable to complete spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a Congress failure to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would result in 23% general cuts and a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a high cut, carried out in such a careless way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impracticable - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians on a borderline basis in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness."
The cutbacks eventually hit the combat troops," said Panetta.
"While the wartime contingents in the anti-terrorism struggle are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war efforts," warned Panetta.
"Personnel recruitment has been cut, which would lead to delays in recruitment and recruitment oversight that support the war."
"Staff's salaries would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime traders, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for more details about the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of a seizure by the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that should be imposed on us."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the senators' new warnings will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or strengthen demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly bluntly voiced the possible cuts, although he has had many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defense painted a gloomy picture of what might be happening - a military with shell, but without core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squadron without properly trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers able to carry out the mission," said Panetta in his opening address at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to engage with potential opponents."
"She actually makes you get angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details on how reductions "creates significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global capabilities to deploy and intervene, leading to unacceptable risks in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could be the victims of the deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the Army and Marine need to replace the Humvee.
If the further development and testing of the F35 were to be stopped, this would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but supporters say that it is an important next step to upgrade, so that potential dangers can be banished by China and other opponents.
How to expose a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy mastering the accusations of sexual harassment on the part of several women, both of whom lie to each other.
Penn State's leadership is accused of perjury because reports have been held back that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
Congressman Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he circulated denials that were quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the violation of campaign funding related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term at the Oval Office.
Stories about cheating at school and college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers have given their students the exam answers so that they were able to stand up to their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
Many of these lies, however, are considered to be an emergency lie.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognising or exposing lies is one that is important for every person to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as Scharaden, in which it is the aim to call "Have you!", the unmasking of a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been exposed.
Lies look into your eyes.
They don't stutter, stammer, blush, and twitch.
However, it cannot be concluded from this that these liars are difficult to uncover and to expose.
A trained liar can penetrate to the truth by learning about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, questioning and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the vast and ever-growing area of decovery, and it is clear that decloaking a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to get the right in our complex world, especially when hiring or questioning people or negotiations or administration are part of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people, raising their interest and controlling their own emotions, and they intuitively sense how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people, that men are more often "self-oriented" lies than women, whose lies are more "oriented to others" - usually to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that when a person has been exposed as an evildoer, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, by observing this person's normal behavior.
It's called baselining, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for assessing changes later.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
You should know better when someone usually sticks his foot all the time, so that they don't blame him unjustly when he tripples his foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that shrill, not as proof of a de-masking.
People who deceive may freeze when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after interview", this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Questioners often falsely signal that an interview is over just to look for this relaxation after the interview.
Also pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson's slipper is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his killed wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceiving persons can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question in general.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than objective, which often makes the alarm bells shrill.
There is no magic to expose lies, but you can learn skills that allow you to expose them.
Thanks to these skills, everyone can be less likely to be the victim of fraud, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after exposure due to delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which angered trade unions and at the same time reassured environmentalists, the pipeline-building companies are trying to re-plan the project so that it can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
After an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week that a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course of the Sandhill area in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a large underwater supply, had been checked.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may postpone a decision until 2013, following the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama declared last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the State Department and pledged his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connecting Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, who oppose the plan, weigh the laws to force a departure from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project has little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the Ministry's main auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is related to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of forcing an infant out of fear to vomit
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had a seizure that scared her little daughter so much that she threw up with fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade made Genevieve Monk so afraid that she was suffering from "personal changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was November 10th last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk got the car, Roseanna Monk took his luggage and Genevieve on his arm went to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle angryly admonished the pregnant woman.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't put your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and started to scold - she used the F-word and the A-word and got very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started to pour water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself at the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby screamed so much that it had to vomit, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no reply.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for comments.
The lawsuit is about an unspecified compensation, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said he didn't charge a fee and planned the family to donate the money they're getting to child cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is shown to a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climate adversity slowed down the economy
In the first year that Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and undeclared work rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in Sinaloa’s economic history. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and raised great hopes regarding economic growth, is in government. However, as a result of climatic adversity, growth cannot be mentioned, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses of millions in agriculture, but also narrowed the boundaries of the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first quarter of the year.This was mainly due to the historic decline in agricultural development of 31.16 percent, which had a restraining effect on other economic sectors.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Susttable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582 000 hectares of farmland were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent partially destroyed. The main areas affected were the cultivation of vegetables, maize and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity up to November has led to a steady rise in unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, with 55,053 inhabitants of Sinaloa having no employment, representing 4.53 percent of the labour force. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28% and from July to September to 6.19%, resulting in 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa, 18,969 more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year is due to several factors. Economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments, the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently witnessing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, the loss of liquidity on the market as a result of the cutbacks in funds from the legislation passed to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who are illegally accumulating dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them or use them for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment also has a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased, due on the one hand to entry problems and on the other hand because it is difficult to find work there as well. These people stay here and look for work here, which increases unemployment," he says.
Undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if one takes into account the high proportion of undeclared work, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38 percent of those employed in the country who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work come from low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institute) and the Secretaria del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Office for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos up to September, much less than the general government average of 7375 pesos.
Decrease in ADIs
In addition to reducing economic activity and increasing unemployment, the largest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) over the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to the Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI amounted to 630 597 dollars from January to June, a decline of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period last year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Agency for Economic Development), for its part, has a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
In the wake of the economic crisis, the state government applied for a loan of 3,000,000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to reactivate the economy in July at the National Congress. The state congress approved an amount of 200,600,000 pesos, but no positive impact of debt on any of the economic sectors in the country could be observed by November.
Reactions
For the representatives of the entrepreneurship, the first year of government made Mario López Valdé's government incapacity apparent.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry in Mexico) argued that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really poor this year, hard work is needed to recover the lost terrain this year and we have to make a double effort in 2012. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already well-coordinated government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the most important impacts is a slowed economy that is not sufficiently in motion to generate an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. That is why we will conclude the year well below our expectations," he said.
Redefining Call
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexico Entrepreneurship Association) in Sinaloa, declared that the state should be encouraged to become more dynamic productive.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the country's economic vocation and line, because it is important to activate Sinaloa's material and human resources," he said.
There's a lot to do
The chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that steers the government's efforts in a better direction.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress in the government.
"There are areas where one can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg marijuana
A native of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The prosecutor's office of the Republic announced that the small drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of marijuana intended for trade.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by the Mexican military during the surveillance of the Cipriano Valdez road opposite guard post No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van, holding a black bag in a box in the car and in the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the district judge and the convicted person is still in the detention centre.
Debt for construction works
The social buildings for migrants provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes are in danger of not being completed due to lack of funds or with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The head of the municipal social development authority said that, although the construction programmes have already progressed, they are now in danger, as the state government has not paid the funds due to it, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programs amounted to almost 50 million pesos, 25 percent of which fell to the state. Up to now, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the completion of the construction is to be expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and even though the year has already ended, they have not given us a penny, and that, even though they had to pay us a part already in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already begun the construction work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money."
He stressed that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had failed to fulfil its obligations and that the municipality had to borrow 7 million at the beginning of its reign, corresponding to the amount that the central government should have raised.
"We had already done so in the last parliamentary term, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued to run and this year we had to obtain the funds that the state had not raised to participate in these programmes," he explained.
Although the public authorities were obliged to pay out these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance had requested that administrative work be speeded up and that the outstanding portion be paid out as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and although the year has already ended, they have not given us a penny."
The court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico in 2015
The switch of analogue signals to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the Presidential Decree, and by virtue of which the switch from analogue to digital signals must be brought forward from 2021 to 2015, due to a lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he published the Legislative Decree laying down the details of switching to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute launched by the Senate, as it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes to enable the Court to decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
The project for the lawsuit, prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed that the Decree-Law be declared unconstitutional, since the regulations relating to radio and television are the responsibility of the Comisión Federal de Telecommunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), which is why the Decree-Law would be contrary to the hierarchical principles and the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree. Upon acceptance of the lawsuits, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Legislative Decree and ceased all activities for the establishment of digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint lodged by the Chamber of Deputies without entering the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the state government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration with general rules.
"I also do not believe that if this were done, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also recalled that the central government is responsible for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it manages state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it results in better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased signal quality and more channels.
The postponement of the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the use of digitalisation, which was a decision in the public interest that had not only technical aspects, "for they encompass economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "made the action of the whole system necessary, according to the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of features that placed the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
It recalled that many countries around the world had already implemented the digital switchover, even though they had highly specialised facilities.
It could not be concluded that, by issuing the contested decree, the government intervened in the powers of Congress, because the laws passed by the legislature were complied with," she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballots in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of individual counting of ballot papers is a reality this year in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governor's elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November, the Electoral Office adopted a series of rules to harmonise local regulations with federal reforms in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, his electoral law or his electoral law to the reforms adopted by Congress, so that they had not entered into force during this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Gazette within the time limits provided for it, arguing that they still had objections to it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional action filed by the local legislature and judged the State Commissioner's vote on the constitutional reforms to be "invalid and illegal", since he did not have the right to "decide or veto it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview about the possibility of individual counting of votes that thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there would now be the possibility that the local electoral authority could count out the ballots in part or in full.
For example, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be counted in part.The results in the minutes do not agree; the minutes of the counting and calculation of votes are not in fact available or are not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total counting of the fully completed ballots may take place if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the winner in second place, who is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the candidates mentioned.
The counting of votes may also take place in its entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the electoral packages that have been subjected to a partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is just under 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés poured down this Sunday evening on Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday, the funeral show and a death mass took place.
According to family members, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was that his ashes would be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an award, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the others, returned to the capital of Coahuila on an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force that was killed in the accident. The closest person to the colonel took part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the Lt-Colonel's ashes landed in the mourning hall on Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family members and friends came.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology. This body show was initiated by his former fellow students from the Technical High School and his American Football Team, to which Felipe Bacio belonged during his preparation for the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains. He had always said that to his family and his friends," announced Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it because they thought it would even make him dizzy on a truck. Nevertheless, he always strove to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good person. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to greet him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán to graduate his family member. That's why he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
A Last Farewell
The Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was passed away with all honours under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López. His honour was bestowed on him by the people and government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military Territory, the Mexican Air Force, school principal and student of the Saltillo Technological Education Institute, where he studied in 1985 and was regarded as outstanding both in his studies and in sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter he flew crashed, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority sat.
At 6:05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, in the forecourt of the barracks by the funeral home. His family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers, were already waiting for him.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot on Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, military personnel introduced the media to eleven people who had been arrested in the same village in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by gunshots into different parts of the body and a mercy shot in an abandoned finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at the mile point 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passers-by saw that the door of the country house, surrounded by a beige-brown wall, stood wide open.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three metres further inside, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow t-shirt and dark trousers, without shoes; next to him was another wearing a white top.
Just one meter away was another person's body with a red T-shirt and blue trousers.
All three were on the belly.
According to the information received on the ground, the three persons must have been murdered in another place, as no shell casings were found.
On the wall of the country house are inscriptions, which one organized criminal gang writes to another, and several bullets were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (Secretary of State for National Defense) introduced 11 persons, including a minor who was part of a criminal gang mainly active in the town of Cadereyta, who were associated with kidnappings, murders, halconeo (human hunt) and secret funerals.
According to the public information, on November 11th, eight people were arrested in the Los Alveros settlement and one prisoner was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured, and the arrested confirmed that they were members of the criminal group Los Zetas.
At 6 a.m. on November 12th, military personnel found a car without license plates with two occupants on their guard lap in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, at 2 p.m. on November 13th, one of her accomplices was arrested in the community of La Frauda, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
They are charged with secret burials in the towns of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce him to the new government, which will face the crisis that led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce him to the new government, which will face the crisis that led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A message from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said that he would present to the President the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of the government.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "framework is well defined now," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of debt to an intolerable level.
The new government, led by former Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package called for by the euro policymakers to regain the confidence that has been built up in Italy.
The pressure to hurry on Monti was exacerbated by the fluctuating market situation, which put a 7 per cent interest on Italian government bonds for 10 years, in line with the situation at which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
After a meeting with Monti, Emma Marcegaglia, President of Confindustria, told the press: "We said we would support this government to the fullest."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were considerably increased by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to bring about good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Centre-Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a majority of technocrats, which Monti is currently forming.
Support from Parliament
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resisting its efforts or delaying reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks also exerts pressure with its indication that Monti's failure is a disaster.
Monti began its debates on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as youth and women's organisations.
The session is scheduled to be completed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who launched an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a short breath towards the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of the Italian government bonds have again reached critical limits due to uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy with a national debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said that his government must last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in view of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties make the inclusion of people from political life complicated.
Spaniards have more opportunities to play than the Ticos
Of the 22 players retrieved from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the hump.
From Costa Rica's side, only one of the 22 players has 50 games behind them.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared for the friendly game that takes place today at 3.05 p.m. in the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, the number one on the FIFA monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of class A selection matches, the three-colour team only has defence player Michael Umana as the only player with more than 50 international matches.
He reached this number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home matches (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, there are the experiences with the Spanish Furie in complicated elimination games at the Eurocup and the World Cups.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have a few international encounters in the context of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA ranking.
We'll see how the Spanish team draws their last record: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who scored a match with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta last Saturday against England (delay 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign matches.
Casillas will play against the three-colour team today and Spain will record a new record of 127 foreign matches.
Xavier Hernández, player of Barcelona Football Club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavier even received recognition last week from UEFA, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle-strucker of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol is also approaching the number 100 with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the side of the Ticos and near Michael Umana are the left side-stormer Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the forward Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there, only five games were played: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The one with the least games.
Less than 30 matches are played by Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
The national team plays less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn't even approaching the 20s.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica Bryan Ruiz scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In the exclusive talk with Viva, the bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assured that a dream would come true for them when they played in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bass player and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day they will perform at the National Stadium from 7.30 p.m. along with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the conversation, whose complete copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realized for us.
This is just the second time we've played in South and Central America, and it's been great so far.
I have only been to Costa Rica once for a holiday. It is such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted. They experience the days before the concert intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry to have taken so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've done in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We played some big shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and love the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and its surf waves?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends always went to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for surfing. Together with Mexico, these are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we have no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so the decision we're going to play is not easy.
If we record two or three songs that we haven’t played for a long time in the repertoire, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they might be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think that's why it's also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
If you look back, it's hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagined playing in a great rock band for more than 20 years, which seems like a dream.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are thrilled to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then a band comes out of a city, but it is unusual when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are still happy to be friends with them all and it honors us to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we are all happy to be alive, and we also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't be better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds of people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has brought into life, without being obsessed with being a famous rock star. We never cared about that anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built up the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why she chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band the best. That's why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That's going to be exciting.
Why do you change Yellow Ledbetter's lyrics every time you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he can think of.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
From so many+
The first ones I can think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive even though it was no longer a fad?
I don't think we all feel very attached to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands that I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. Although they are still important today, I think it’s great because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are making better music than ever.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
That's interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit careless, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark songs, although they also have something positive about them.
Both of them came to my tears when I heard Ed playing them. They are very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, when you lose a family member or a friend - that influences your artistic work and your music and these two songs clearly embody this for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his family doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years in prison for violation of human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which operates four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Congressman and his personal physician, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days in the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish this because he thought he was innocent.
He has been operated on four times with tongue cancer and has lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition, the doctor listed other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, hypertension and blood circulation problems in the legs.
Fujimori has been in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía Detention Centre since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the Peruvian army's death squad, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss regional political issues.
Mujica will meet his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the Uruguayan president, this will be the highlight of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is appropriate for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", announced the presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is looking for Calderón's support for the incident with France when French head of government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in Cannes, France.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that still exist as tax havens. This declaration was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request from his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the most powerful emerging and industrialised countries in the world. Since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has sought to speed up the implementation of tax information exchange agreements in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not adopted all international standards for tax cooperation.
At the business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The purrbeared installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years for the rescue of Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game that comes to the store counters around the world this month has been tailored from the very beginning to the characteristics of the Nintende 3DS portable console, which can be played three-dimensionally without any special glasses.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," assured Omar Álvarez, the responsible for the Nintendo-specialized press in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game by Nintendo that was developed for this console from the very beginning", because up to now successful articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman pointed out that although it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "affordable" video game that allowed a fast, fluid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "light" to capture the less tasted users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" over the different levels of games, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, in order to overcome the obstacles without being the victim of the "optical effects", it is always necessary to play three-dimensionally.
This Super Marios trip into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo winks to the fans of the Saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: The purr-bearded installer has to overcome risk-picked platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news in the movements, the environment, disguises and enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would allow the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to take responsibility in the United States for the conspiracy to pay $70 million in money laundering.
Thus, the trial of the US application for extradition of Portillo ends, so that it can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, taking into account that a ruling court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that he had not interfered in court decisions during his government and had allowed all extradition requests which he was informed of.
Besides Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is extradited for murder and serious assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's action is an act of government that takes place when all judicial and constitutional authorities have been exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited once its legal situation in Guatemale has been clarified and its human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted in the Ministry of Defense during his reign for the embezzlement of 120 million Quetzales, which was preceded by extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case anew.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organisation was set up to avoid the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinijove social assistance organisation have led to important results: In this quarter century, 6000 young people threatened with social exclusion were supported in order to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are more than one hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, attended by more than 300 people, was held yesterday.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with a low level of education, without work, with drug problems at risk of marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of officials from institutions and institutions who have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The participation of political representatives from different directions during election campaigns demonstrated the impartiality of the work carried out by Trinijove.
In addition to the president of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former socialist minister of education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green city councillor Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and Jaume Lanaspa, Director General of the Social Fund of La Caixa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was born in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is "a good foundation".
For the president of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does," he explained.
Occupied house, where giant parties were held, was cleared
The owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without resisting.
Everything points out that the nightmares of the neighbors of House No. 51 on the street Balmes have come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday at noon voluntarily the building that they held illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The evacuation took place on a judicial order without police intervention.
After clearing, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the house manager confirmed.
The squatters, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the others were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply with them. In addition, they had painted the walls and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinate, explained to Europa Press that her business had declined by 80% since the start of the household occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the squatters made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks at three euros, while in the discotheque they cost 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the leisure place had been reported by the neighbors for disturbance of the peace, while according to their statement the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the squatters and especially from the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and which according to the angry neighbors became more and more in recent weeks.
The person responsible for the discotheque explained that the harassment was so great that it agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that she had received more complaints from her neighbours in the last weeks.
Last week, the president of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in Barcelona's city council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, called for the building to be removed immediately and for the problems of civil coexistence to be dealt with and for the neighbourhood to come down.
He explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before the summer, but that the squatters had penetrated into all floors of the building and almost all apartments in recent months. In some even thefts had occurred.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against the anti-social actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., the police approached Montral Street No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree to the tender, apart from the disputes over the fees.
The urban tender for the 16 gates opens up the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its reprimand about the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the downfall of the CMB in 1987, the park became, in the eyes of many, again the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in the north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a nature park plays with this idea.
Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of yogi bear served as a model no longer Central Park.
This was the time when the city issued a huge invitation to tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either that's the way it is, or somebody's planning to put gates on the land.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, Park or Berg?
The call is not only from an organizational point of view, but also in view of a reflection on the city, the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme, on which two members of this old caste, who meet in the elevator, can fall back.
And it is precisely this fact that provides the material for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, it is "necessary" to speak about the "front of the mountains" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which about the green apples, has not been carried out.
"One should assume that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Tore of Collserola" harbours a "lexical trap": it is not "to be imagined as approaches to a park, but as a limitation of areas in which action must be taken."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban planning experience, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that carries "some dangers".
Dangers resulting from the "uncertainty that the design of a public space brings with it today" according to the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan singing" in the field of the forum.
The first fear is one's own limitation to what can be built.
"Limiting something always means setting the next step", i.e. exceeding it.
"One has to think about new urban planning tools, because the present [referring to the plan General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real catastrophe."
Modol, who adheres to the question, simply means that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study of the Patronate de Collserola, which should not "fall on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration that it has given his committee the opportunity to participate in this project "from the very first moment".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the letter of conduct, which allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubt" as to whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams that have been set up ("just the right thing," he says), "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, as the tender conditions lack a global view of Collserola: "16 cross-sectional competitions have been advertised," he says, "on the mountain-sea axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that considers the area in its entirety."
This has led, at least in his case, to his participation in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the stripe is equipped right above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, which creates a soft transition between city and green zones.
Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, Casino Red's agent freed the mayor of Monterrey's brother from the trial that was being waged against him for alleged extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the agent of Casino Red has given him the trial of the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion before the district's Second Criminal Court.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás can be seen, presumably forcing him to pay a sum of money to allow the city administration to approve the secret operation of the betting house.
After the lawsuit, the prosecutor opened a criminal case against the brother of the Panist mayor, who was arrested for 30 days on September 2nd.
After four hours with Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He remained there 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after Ministerio Público's official had dismissed the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Detention Centre because he allegedly bribed the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the Central Security Ward, as death threats against him existed.
The authorities allowed him to take part in the trial as an inmate of the San Nicolás de los Garza city prison.
On 25 October, Jorge Yánez, secretary of the District's Second Criminal Court, issued an order for detention, which found that after almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to make Jonás guilty of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the Wetthaus to open it in return.
This Monday, the representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to give the sentence, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the court-affiliated Ministerio Público, asked García Gómez whether he had corrected the damage and which of the owners of the betting house had given his forgiveness. However, the lawyer withheld the name.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is free to speak, and in the following, no objections can be made to the case and no compensation is required.
After hearing the representative of the Wetthaus at 3:50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the San Nicolás de los Garza city prison to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and his case was filed.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the aircraft accident in which the Secretary of Government Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transport - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident, in which the Secretary of State Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people were killed, indicated that the helicopter with its whole undamaged structure had hit the ground directly without the pilot being able to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for communications and transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before take-off that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wings had contact with trees at a height of 25 metres, with the helicopter losing the fuselage, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, so he fulfilled all the requirements for the transport of the personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the machine had run down.
"No parts of the aircraft were found elsewhere in the search, and the impact affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, so it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to get the results as soon as possible, but this could take several months, perhaps even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, General Director of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico) assured that the helicopter had flown from Estado Mayor Presidencial at cruising speed and the plane had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of impact."
At a press conference, the head of SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of visual flight. This means that the crew must have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at take-off. During the further flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some low-hanging clouds were raised.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that due to the clouds the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar record of the helicopter match. There may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or a deviation from the flight route before the impact.
Dispersal of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available up to now suggests that the helicopter had bounced from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter with its intact structure had hit the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the plane at the scene of the accident indicate neither fire nor explosion.
The latest results indicate several soil contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is steep and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a meticulous search in an area beyond the restricted area at the scene of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the unharmed aircraft structure had bounced against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to locate the obesity gene
She is leading a research project on the discovery of the obesity gene in children and adolescents, supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is conducting a research project on the discovery of the gene of obesity in children and adolescents, entitled "Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Youth", which aims to find the genetic markers associated with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was set up.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are carried out every Saturday from 8 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation began on the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and continued on the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) since October 8th.
When the target of 500 to 600 investigators is reached, the study will be continued on the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and completed on the one of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn about the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents in the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global Diabetes Day, he said that the goal would be for three thousand children and adolescents between the ages of six and 14 to complete nutrition-related questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and family disease history to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or kidney failure.
He also stated that on those Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, size, waist), their blood pressure was monitored and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes associated with childhood obesity) were determined.
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out on the occasion of the health staff's concern about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in almost six years the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent. Obesity also increased dramatically," the specialist of the IMSS stressed.
He claimed that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that an average Mexican was 65 percent Indian-American, 30 percent European and 5 percent African, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess energy (calories) that is taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the subjects would be a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even investigate the presence of dark skin folds in the neck and inner arm (akanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information would be kept confidential and sent to the parents in writing by the doctors. Doctors explain to the parents all measurement results and suggest to them changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors that are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, most of the day to spend in front of the TV and use means of transport, instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbohydrates (tameles, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high intake of fat and protein as well as the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM, develops polymer-modified asphalts to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If attention were paid to the signs of the road surface, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 potholes if the rainy season broke out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (town area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt surface were done appropriately, the number of potholes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Keyholes from a Technical Perspective", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Mr. Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as some cities in the north of the country, in order to improve the behaviour of the road surface and thus avoid the occurrence of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound of which one part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low one - the so-called malthens. Together they give the road surface its characteristic viscous behavior.
Tensile behaviour of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very viscous and at 50°C almost solid, while at very low temperatures it becomes brittle.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," said the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher noted that the majority of the streets of Mexico City had a flexible road surface composed of six layers of material, of which the last three included asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a wear layer of asphalt made of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer has been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move on to it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he explained, "a final layer is designed, the so-called support layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was bathed in asphalt.
Since these layers are in contact with the vehicle tyres, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they must produce friction.
The weight of this road surface receives and distributes most of the forces, the supporting layer also needs an appropriate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes moist, water penetrates into the layer and is difficult to exit, causing all layers of the road surface to soften and, consequently, potholes to appear.
When a pothole is created," he said, "the surface layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards. However, the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that should be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of potholes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be relative to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries, and with which the potholes could be repaired easily and without using high temperatures.
What was the lack of the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that had an effect on Melina Ramírez Serna's not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th mistitle.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went out empty in awarding the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winning podium, displaying a silver crown and the band she identified as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department already comes to 14 mistitles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in their hands. Among the proclaimed Misses are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many today are asking is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite, who had shown at each performance that she had everything she could to be the new Miss Colombia. It was not for nothing that she had been elected Queen of the Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles which also had been given to the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia home with them.
The first factor that is considered decisive for the jury's decision to appoint her as First Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "Which book has influenced you most and why?", which had been put to her by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I pretty much believe in literature, I think it's a way to civilize, ultimately I believe that the book that shaped most for my childhood is 'The Little Prince', a very deep-going book.
At the moment I am reading 'guilty and atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am currently reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'passionships'.
An answer that came up against little love, firstly because of the concept of 'civilizing' and secondly because it had not explained in concrete terms how each book she mentioned had influenced it.
But after the ceremony, Melina explained that she felt calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that El Valle's favorite has burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the favourite who had taken all the incidentals and had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomie competition Easter, audience vote on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre) had made the other candidates jealous, which stressed the queen, who could not shine on stage."
And that was noticed at her first performance in a swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at her two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although she appeared safely with both, she lacked the strength and momentum of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the channel RCN, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins most prizes during the competition does not eventually become Queen".
In addition, Valle went out of the way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will have his reason that two days before the international jury's compilation Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, on the fact that she had already worked on projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of derriere and fibrosis, which were noted to her in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The Queen's coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there would be better, "but her problem with fibrosis on the abdomen, which, frankly, was hardly noticeable to me, pushed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to get them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay."
Because of this award, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction arose after the appearance in the swimsuit, which was to come true at night. It was whispered that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether that's true or not, the fact is that Melina will begin her reign from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions on the nomination of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who had missed the crown despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoscopeist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4, a Lophoskopist of the Investigation Unit of the Procuratorate (CTI) from Cali came in as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia): "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopeists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González was on duty, a Puerto Tejada man who has been working on criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go into the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the necessary courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
During the week of use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he flew from Palmira to Cauca by helicopter.
He knew he was supposed to identify two bodies, and there was suspicion that one of them could be the one of the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world. Therefore, he was to take the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the location where the body was, he could not identify it because of its physical appearance, for it was not in the slightest similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planting trowel and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, this Puerto Tejada-born man was responsible for informing the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was indeed the head of the FARC.
Searching for traces
For a Dactyloscope from the Sijín in Cali, the appreciation given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use against "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Daktyloscopy is an exact science without a rate of error, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopeists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the persons arrested.
When they are arrested, many offenders present false identification documents or they do not have any.
We'll take their fingerprints and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that in case of a theft he had to rip a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had supported himself with his hand at this very point when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Wounds are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we could take the imprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had taken part in several thefts," he recalled.
The fingerprints can also be used to relieve or burden suspects of murder.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
During the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspect, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A Dactyloscopeist from the CTI stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
When they appear, a planting trowel or a band is used to take them away.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the civil service.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification papers," said the CTI expert.
He said that not everything was as shown in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, neither is everything that you touch, a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "indignant" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents on Zuccotti Square.
A large part of it followed the order to evacuate and changed its location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged the authorities of New York this Tuesday when they tried to enter Manhattan Square again with a judicial order after they had been cleared of the square at dawn and had tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of Zuccotti Square, where they sought access with a judicial order that allowed the "indignant" to re-camp at this point. Meanwhile, another part of the movement adhered to the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city where nine arrests took place.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokesmen of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray stated that the response of the "indignants" to the clearing of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent clearing of the square and allowing the protesters to camp.
In addition, the "indignants" occupied a new park located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, and is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not give exact figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he had also seen several journalists handcuffed among them.
The organization assures that hundreds of people arrived at this place, where a delegation of religious leaders had arrived as a sign of their support to the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a private property site) remains closed in anticipation of a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, in which the legality of the eviction taking place at dawn is to be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators driven by the square carried photocopies of this judicial order and distributed it. They even gave it to some policemen who were guarding the square, resulting in "some small clashes", as Bray reported, who had reported that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The judicial order forbids the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street from the square, as well as the application of "laws passed after the occupation and forbid the protesters to return to the park with their tents and other things they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that, due to this judicial order, the reopening of the square for public traffic and the demonstrators had been lifted. He pointed out to the demonstrators that the city laws did not allow them to re-install themselves with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the clearing of Zuccotti Square at dawn, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators were "infringing the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the square because it had "turned into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people" because "some businesses would have received threats" and the residents were "anxious about their quality of life."
"The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting financial interests and not in protecting the interests of North American workers," added the movement spokesman who accused the mayor of "not respecting the freedom of the press."
The officials of Occupy Wall Street informed that they were thinking about organising "great actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have lasted since September 17th.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will be on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Canadian TV Christmas show.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson will perform together with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1st on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson - also for the distribution on the Internet of a self-made porno, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as a Virgin Mary with a doll in the lap that Jesus is supposed to represent.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently appeared as a presenter in Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as Jesus Child.
The Christmas program of CTV not only relies on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé had described North American Kim Kardashian as a "whore".
Japan Reborn after the Earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still recovering after the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced during World War II.
The government’s initial estimates in Tokyo assessed the damage to property at $300,000, a strike that seems to weaken despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of continuous falls, data on gross domestic product from July to September were used to finalise this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% compared to the annual rate.
In addition, the second quarter of the year – in Japan, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 – represents the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machines for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
Indeed, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decline of 0.9% for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of inexorable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual turnaround of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynsian impulses that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan has woken up thanks in particular to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increasing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - entered one of the "currencies" of investors fleeing the eurozone's debt crisis and the bleak forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that weighs like a gravestone on the accounts of export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the yen’s quotation.
While the markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"One has to pay attention to the continuing risks, for example the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy yesterday.
The prospects are really not very exhilarating.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had shown clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator that precedes the turning points of the world economy showed that the greatest economic potential would have been slowed down.
For it sank by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro-zone is even below this average, which is 100 after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts
Papadimos says the austerity measures will be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high risk premiums of peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece is also further lost in the labyrinth that leads out of the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more a reaction to pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces, is slowly proven by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the one hundred days agreed upon when he was appointed might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and that he would by no means withdraw his demand for new elections on the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the October 26 summit," Papadimos assured yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, reform of the disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not express doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism that must unblock the 8000 million that Athens urgently needs. He made it clear that he would not approve of a commitment to the implementation of austerity measures.
But yesterday, the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reiterated that its demand was not to be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and leaders of the main Greek parties signed "a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed for the payment of the sixth section of 8000 million euros", although there is no final date yet.
The Greek ball still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "predominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance".
Yesterday, Queen Sofía of Spain recalled that Spain has become the second donor of this means of international cooperation worldwide over the last two decades. Its "being" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for all humanity based on trust in people".
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the millennium goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of the number of people who have to live with income of less than one dollar a day, that is, below the "poverty limit".
Spain "continues to work" on the extension of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task responsibly", noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will come from the summit, which lasts until Thursday, will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have achieved many successes" and "are facing many challenges."
The summit on microcredit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for launching "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen said that the goal would be for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty line.
In Spain and the rest of the world, the concept of micro-credit goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia judges as an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financial instrument as an "admirable idealist committed to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about the local loan strategy.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings in the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. All of them "have seen a continuous development", said the Queen, whose commitment to this project brought her yesterday's assessment as "Head of the Family" in Valladolid and as "Speaker of the Poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid to times of economic boom, because it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez felt that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty", and that the governments of the developed countries now had to work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the most important forms of development aid.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success", "marginalized" people "always standing in front of closed doors" to give "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that opened "their gates infected with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig) was without real difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was originally not included in the programme, but prevailed in the autumn, in particular in order to satisfy those activists who regard government policy as lax with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow.
The Presidency proposal of the European Commission, proposed by the Bureau, was adopted almost unanimously.
Under 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The standing ovation, which lasted several minutes, which initially applied to Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Schäuble a few hours later due to their intervention decrees, did not leave any doubt on the part of the three European-led finance ministers.
The Chancellor's main idea, as well as the proposals, is that the response to the crisis is "no less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected by a modification of the Lisbon Treaty, which would strengthen the control of the European Union, with regard to the budget policies of the countries in the euro area, but this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general voting" in order to give Europe a face".
This is, however, in any case one of the proposals adopted by Congress, which clearly supported Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is hardly likely that the 47 will soon agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone is set.
Similarly, the delegates, in an overwhelming majority, rejected the proposal to weight each country on the ECB board according to the weighting of the individual economies, which would obviously lead to a strengthening of Germany's position.
The Chancellor, who was concerned about calming the climate within her party, therefore strengthened the reference points for Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
As far as the European request devotes a paragraph to the significance of the "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France to the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that two centuries ago Leipzig was at the centre of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the scam represent in case of sick reports?
After the family benefits, UMP and the government are now tackling the illness reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund and present a speech on the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on an attempt to put the economy to the test, but which on the other hand represents no less than a harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to concentrate on employee sickness reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government aims to introduce a fourth day of waiting before taking account of a complaint to workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the salary of four days without the approval of the specific company, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos" threatens to provoke anger, but would help to bring in EUR 280 million.
And that would be accompanied by a different measure of a rather symbolic character: to give the state officials an unremunerated day of waiting in case of illness (to date, unlike the three days of waiting in the private sector, there is no waiting period for them).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority is also reinvigorating the subject of fraud, this time aimed at the abuse associated with work absence.
"Controls will be much more important, and they will also be remunerated if required," Xavier Betrand warned of RTL's microphone on Sunday, November 13th.
As in other cases, the impact of this notification on the reality of fraudulent actions in the area of sick reports appears to be somewhat unproportional.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent observation and political offensives since 2002, which have been the most fruitful.
The French are no longer more sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Fund CNAM, more than 237 million euros of daily severance payments were paid in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of the health care sector, the daily severance payments in 2008 amounted to 11.3 billion euros, representing 5% of health expenditure.
This figure included 46% on maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% on sick leave, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
And therefore 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, an average of only 14.5 days of sick leave was granted to the French according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
An average that masks certain differences: another published in 2007 by Monster.com, a website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40,000 surveyed French workers said they did not take a single day of sick leave.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, shows that 37% of sick people reported in 2010 were of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% were between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Thus, compared with their European neighbours, French workers no longer tend to be incapacitated than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French National Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absenteeism rate (sickness or other reasons) oscillated between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sickness fraud accounts for a negligible proportion of undeclared work.
As far as fraud is concerned, only a weak extent is achieved here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 implies that there are systmatic checks on sick persons who exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for the training and further training of technicians and engineers) found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term illness reports that were "unjustified or too long" in 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled cases of illness of more than 45 days duration, less than 1.2 million 11% of "unsuited or unjustified" cases were counted, i.e. 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases to several million workers who have filed a complaint.
A figure which represents only a weak extent to, for example, that of undeclared work.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of a factual report on this question published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the defraidation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needed a new adjustment programme to intercept its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced to Parliament that the 100 days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to complete this task.
"In order to continue efforts to boost the economy, we need support from our European partners as well as a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of government in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's involvement within the euro area was "at stake", as he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's government deficit "in order to reduce the 9%" of today's gross domestic product by the end of the year, which was 10.6 % in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new austerity measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent to the measures already approved regarding an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but had sent forward that his party would not be prepared to make an additional saving.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a congress of his New Democracy Party.
He had agreed to reduce budget deficit and debt, as well as to fight waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, the EU Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all the parties regarding their support for the planned measures, had replied to Antonio Samaras that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalised, according to a panel of experts.
The Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, including beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually engage in talking to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, interlinked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the penal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia, where this choice is made, and in the case of patients considered to be able to make such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts cite a recently published survey by the independent company EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "medical care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid of cutting the issue of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to pain-killing drugs, according to the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the Canadian majority desire to die at home, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
From the country as a whole, the rate of hospital deaths in Quebec is highest at 86%.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it intends to make no changes to the penal law concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
But according to the experts, who have inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would lead to abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide by uncompetent or unwilling persons.
On the contrary, there are much more cases of such violations, especially in those countries where euthanasia and associated suicide are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Even accompanied suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians Support Euthanasia
Let us remember that according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of the Canadians had already expressed themselves in favour of euthanasia, because they believe that at the end of their lives, they allow people to alleviate their sufferings.
And 66% believe that the fact that euthanasia is legalised does not mean that the message is that the lives of elderly or disabled people are of less value.
With regard to those who have already committed an accompanying suicide, 41% of the respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or cessation of treatment in patients, the report's authors say that the situation is less clear.
They also suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the withdrawal of funds for which a valid refusal had been made should not be considered criminal.
The Panel also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the withdrawal of funds at the end of life, and to fear this without criminal prosecution.
The Panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, including beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the means already widely used in the Canadian health care institutions for pain relief or life-end measures, the Panel calls for at least consideration of these, as they were not used to reduce physical pain and to refer to the same procedures as euthanasia.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the position of the reporting experts as "extreme" among other things, since this does not limit the euthanasia practice of patients in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation in which everyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years is asking another person to help him commit suicide," says RA Deschamps, who yesterday reviewed a summary of the report.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place individual responsibility over all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there are "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, specialist in health law, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she described as a "pro-euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the report on the absence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and associated suicide are legalised, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the authorities of the Foreign Ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on Bashar al-Assad's Syria, which, thanks to Russia's support, resists it and rejects a "complot" against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before Syria was excluded by the Arab League, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbouring countries, had taken a position in favour of President Assad's resignation.
King Abdullah II. Of Jordan yesterday was the reigning Arab Prime Minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "set aside his authority in Syria" in which already about forty civilians and members of the government power were killed.
"If Bashar cares about his country's interest, he would resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the King of Jordan, Syria's neighbour, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, had complained that the attempts to mediate with Turkey, which had been directed to the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year, had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people, and cannot satisfy them, must leave," he said, alluding to Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey is taking a more and more harsh stance.
The United States, for its part, has welcomed the "enhancing of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have set an ever-increasing tone in the face of repression in Syria," observes Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Department of State.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the Dar'a region in southern Syria have died, according to the Syrian Human Rights Observatory OSDH.
According to this NGO, two other civilians were killed in "shootings and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs.
At a press conference, the Syrian foreign trade minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless felt that the country was "taxing towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has reacted emphatically to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considers to be a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not yield," he added, under the assurance that "the plots forged against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also expressed his support for the deployment of UN observers to protect civilians from the regime's repression of its "paranoia".
An extraordinary new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the crisis phase-out, adopted on 2 November, but in particular the controversial and probable withdrawal of the military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov yesterday considered the decision of the Arab League to be "uncorrect" in order to avoid the endorsement of possible sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that "victims" demanded in order to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which is composed of external technocrats in a relatively strict manner.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had, for his part, made it clear that Mario Monti would give Parliament a vote of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by M. Monti of a list of deletions, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to Giorgio Napolitano, head of state.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of stock market and bond markets demanded her time.
In "a democracy, there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed, stating that "it is certain that markets will show themselves to be dutiful and understanding".
His appointment by the president was welcomed at the beginning by the markets, but the unrest had intensified, especially after an unexpected industrial decline in the eurozone in September.
The current Prime Minister should set up a staff composed of mainly technocrats, although he had stressed that he would also like to involve "politicians".
He estimated that the new government would only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government was to receive Parliament's confidence by Friday.
M. Monti has since taken up his role committed himself to working urgently in the spirit of the objective of making Italy the "renewed protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy itself does not change in the light of the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budget balance target in 2013, despite the austerity plans taken up in recent months, has in particular requested new toughness measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, "Chief of Italy's leaders, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic recovery" since a country which has no growth at all cannot respect deficit indicators".
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epoche change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" as well as a "other Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown here would be the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy has to pay for 200 billion euros of state bonds from now until April 2012.
Russian scientist helps Iran’s nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran to develop a nuclear-weapon-capable detonator, so on Monday confirmed an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks.
The Institute of Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Agency for Nuclear Safety AIEA and other documents originating from this UN agency to investigate this scientist.
OIOs last week shared their "serious concern" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to a thorough study of AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was said to have left the centre to set up a company in Kiev that produces "Nano Diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he had participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, AIEA mentioned "strong evidence that Iran's development of a nuclear explosive system" had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only very well versed in this technology, but also, as a member of the State of the Agency announced, had worked his entire professional career on this technology directly on the military nuclear programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and offences have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racial or religiously motivated violent crimes, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, have either slightly decreased or only slightly increased in the same period.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, whereas there has been a 13% increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes committed against Jews, and a 14% global increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" has risen to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences of motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the human rights organization Human Rights First emphasized."The rise in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of the law against human rights," added Paul Legendre, a head of the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, assessing that this could be done in an improved police attitude towards "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in American federal law is a legacy from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther King in order to punish acts of violence directed against race, colour, religion or descent and now also includes crimes of sexual belonging.
Twitter transforms the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
On Monday, the Twitter Microblogging website introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to enable its users, in particular, to monitor the activities of those who follow their entries, making the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new "Activity" tab and another "Name" tab better enable legible live tracking of the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") are tracked and who are tracking your messages.
This allows you to find out whether they allow you to track your messages, whether you subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general internet distribution on Monday "in August with a small percentage of users", the Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner stated in front of the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, endowed with some esothermal-looking wording (RT for referenced repetition of another person's contribution). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utiliseur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users debated this innovation via the Internet with the help of certain "tweets".
"It's useless, intrusive, and it's too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The "Activity" function will help me track certain elements of my Flux Twitter better," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entry of a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution
On Tuesday, the government of the great Social-Democratic/Christian-Democratic coalition, which is in power in Austria, decided to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top bond (AAA).
It was the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann, who had announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, that is, far above the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay had not been reduced to AA+ at a stroke, we would have to pay three billion euros in additional interest every year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister.
Austria is also calling for the Brussels summit of the euro area Member States on 26 October: the Heads of State or Government had demanded that the reduction of public deficits be included by the end of 2012 as well as a return to the public balance of accounts in the constitution or by adopting an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government for this purpose is similar to the "German model" since Germany was the first European country to incorporate such a "rule" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and by 2017, the federal state's structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas the regional states, as well as the municipalities, should have balanced budgets.
The objective is to eliminate budgetary debt under the 60% criterion established by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Strong yen
Noda faces a new intervention on the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authority would intervene again on currency markets if the yen continued to rise.
"If we establish excessive volatility in the yen exchange rate, we will intervene just as we did the last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen had once again moved close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31st.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold yen against dollars to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is about to set a new record against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has regularly risen above it, doped by buying investors who see the yen as a "refugee value" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar recorded around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese motto harms the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the cost of "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value of Japanese companies drawn from abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region in the north-east," stresses M. Noda, who fears that this inflation of the yen can already kill the weak upturn in the bud.
With growth in the third quarter, the third world economic power once again gained momentum compared to the previous quarter, thanks to the rapid increase in exports and the consumption of households "plombed" by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the yen's inflation does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to defuse the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the Institute, has, however, informed that the BOJ has already launched "appropriate measures", indicating that no additional currency easing can be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to cover the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) it had spent on various purchases of financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
Euro-zone:
Rate feet up fast, stock exchanges backsliding
The risk of contagion in the debt crisis constantly undermines the European indicators.
Despite the inauguration of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are drifting a little more into negative areas this Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and dropped to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt decreased by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions in government bond yields in the eurozone in difficulty, global equity markets are continuing to release part of their recent profits.
"The investors are nervous and are only too well aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The Tokyo stock exchange, which in turn suffers from the renewed fear of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe that the debt crisis will continue, had closed with a Baisse of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its eyes on Europe, and trade is on a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone is damaging the single currency, which will continue its crisis on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for one and a half months.
Around 10 o'clock the European Valuta was worth 1.3570 Dollers, so it declined by 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it has declined after the CDU, party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered in Congress on Monday, granted an application which in particular provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The interest rates on loans from Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the return on Italian bonds reached 6.85% for 10 years, while the Spanish title matured to 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed investor fears.
The future Italian head of government Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, which was threatened by paralysis due to the debt burden.
For its part, the new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro-zone summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the visir of the markets, as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The interest shear ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
In anticipation of growth in the eurozone
Statistically, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, driven by household consumption, a little better than the 0.3% expected.
However, the Federal Statistical Office (INSEE) had revised the Baisse figures for the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that worries economic experts the most.
Germany, for its part, experienced growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first extrapolation of the eurozone as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts Should Win Over Dogmen
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is pushing ahead with a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, an enormous proportion of the world's population should not have to give up a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to mitigate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which submits its decision to the need to find a substitute source capable of substitution, nor in Switzerland, which only intends to build nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
After Fukushima, the United States has decided to add another unit to its park by restarting the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model, which is aimed at renewable energy sources, is occasionally presented as a model, reality, however, contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will take the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, especially on Russia, as a result of the increased use of imported gas, an increase in CO2 emissions from gas and coal-fired power stations.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives cause for reflection.
Denmark, on the one hand, is the European leader in the wind energy table, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, and on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
As the energy price in the globalised economy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of industrial stability on national soil, French companies have an advantage due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a sharp increase in the price of energy, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys showed that this is a price that the large majority of French people are not willing to pay, as it shows resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a large number of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France were to take the decision to withdraw from nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual EUR 6 billion in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would increasingly shrink.
What electrician would commission an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the decline of his producer was preprogrammed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one has to admit that there is no such thing as a devil's work a miracle medium for the production of electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy demonstrate the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a safety authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent checks in already existing plants such as at the construction site in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the security concept.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, without consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was caused by reactor construction as well as indefensible human error.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the same lessons from this accident as it did after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach and a cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a draft that enables it to withstand such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable to build a nuclear power plant among the electrical engineers, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by giving them free access to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party leaders dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overloading police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had titled itself.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students by the authorities had shaped the newsreels, the Minister of the Interior had casually (see Libération of 23 May) announced that France "had no need of talents, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right, Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", on the left, by Michel Rocard, who explained in 1990 that France "could not absorb the entire poverty of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity
The fear of the invasion of national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was divided in 2005 from both right and left.
Both camps perceived immigrants as a burden for the economy and French society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity one is willing to admit to immigrants.
In his programme, Francois Hollande confines himself to banalities, which point out that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remind us in a recent publication, which summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there exists a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Limiting immigration would depress growth and harm the labour market situation.
Fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to substitute the domestic labour force, especially the less skilled, by exerting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than native wage-earners, since they are mainly engaged in occupations in sectors which are unencumbered in terms of employment.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local wage-earners, while the more qualified among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not in line with labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, this complementarity also has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labour market between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants results in a factor of a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants is beneficial (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social security systems, with an average of around 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 will, on average, contribute a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring about the missing intersections "with the teeth" in the beginning of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which should deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had passed the entire 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some had probably believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote in the most direct way possible to see democracy triumph over its enemies once and for all.
One knows since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a characteristic of the attitude.
The universal right to vote, which is the necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can also become an "oppression instrument", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe we are in is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first and foremost a political and democratic crisis.
The change of attitude of the Greek referendum on the truth and the false would have had a twofold illuminating character in this respect: the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of their impossibility and inadequacy.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for the success of the national referendum, which has been organised in accordance with the needs and in a wrong order.
A ticket for the European sole ruler or a leap into the void of nationalist retreat with blindfolded eyes: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, of full right, clarified and constantly, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - by the way, we do not know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and it reigns in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is bowing to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, suffering from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at the international level.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - it is the whole of Europe which is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every single one of the nations attached to it.
The urgency is to give the sovereignty of the people the leadership of the European project back to hand.
It is up to the Europeans as a whole to reduce the burden of their debts, to free themselves from the markets and to create a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis is conditional on decisions at European level, which cannot be made without total democratic justice, without surely leading us to ruin.
After a long period of fighting over this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone is now pushing European economic governance to do so.
Agreed.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it suggests to the citizens - this would be another folly and another dead end.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
In order to create the republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This teaching remains valid.
We need to form a more integrated Europe at an economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become a common commodity
The world trade fair for chip cards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 was supposed to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is contactless technology, which allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless smart cards were to be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share was expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground with regard to contactless payment after long lags behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards were distributed.
However, consumer markets are steaming.
Carrefour therefore issued 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move faster, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing over bank cards with contactless chip to their customers in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A tiny percentage of devices have so far been equipped with the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology required to carry out these transactions.
"They're in arrears."
"But they should at least experience a real upswing next year."
"In 2012, we expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also announced yesterday that it would prepare the market launch of an offer that would allow its customers contactless payment via mobile phone.
Terrorist front understands itself, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "acquired certainty about it".
"The way in which both organizations work together, as well as the relations between the secret services, indicates clear cooperation," he explained without going into any further detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French people in Niger last January had revealed interfaces.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by followers of the Aqmi, are said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation carried out by the French Special Forces.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the debris at the scene.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but there is no doubt that more clear evidence has to be awaited before we can speak of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem".
"But it's conceivable."
"For years, it has been known that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from outside and that it is increasingly becoming active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo mitigates.
In these recent months, these "support services" have become increasingly apparent in their course, as have the speeches and the operating modes of Boko Harem, which now point to the involvement of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives bearing the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, in order to begin with Washington, has been putting pressure on Abuja since then to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed long considered the group to be a community of Illuminati, which does not need to be given special attention.
Fast success
Boko Haram, founded in Maiduguri near a mosque, a school and fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf in 2002, - which means "Western education is a disgrace" in Haoussa - pursues the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this destitute region, the merger is rapidly successful.
It politicizes and claims strict adherence to Sharia, while its affiliated activists fight against the godless central government.
The activists initially target churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram's activists were particularly active with their increased attacks against the Commissariat.
However, Abuja's reaction is, as usual, indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, killing 800 people.
Muhammad Yusuf, taken into captivity, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming increasingly radical and leaving its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to an assassination in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June Boko Haram is blamed for a suicide bombing that occurred in the secured police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations became a priority international target.
Since then, the formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which will lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has alarmed all security experts.
While Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned of Boko Harem and showed himself ready to give all the information."
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq, and assistance to Israel.
Can a crisis-torn America lead a complex world with simple, not to say simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate like that, voters could almost get that impression.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their comrades have repeatedly made their thundering statements, as well as their statements on foreign policy, a traditional republican focus.
China, Iran and Israel's aid - often in no way supported - are the subject of slogans.
The Mitt Romney, who is at the top of the list with regard to the appointment of the Grand Old Party, threatened to quote the Chinese to the WTO and to accuse them of "currency manipulation" - a leading topic in an America that is most provoked by the emigration of entire industries to Asia.
Dumbly run, if this is to imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost cut off his emotions-smoothing gesture.
He had called for a firm but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obama).
But Huntsman is not being answered because he is stagnating in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's Likeness
Romney had also vowed military blows against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear program were to fail.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran," he toned.
"When Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
He has also promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama of remaining guilty of this partner's obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second highest placed candidate, for his part displays a shameful ignorance of the file.
Recently, he called for the Chinese military threat to be countered, as Beijing "attempts to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to ignore the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and demands military blows against Iran, expresses his willingness to use the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture measures against suspected terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009 was also advocated by Cain, Perry and the candidacy of Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Against current presidential opponents, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was also an amateur and had to pour water into his wine, which concerned the subject of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
This hostility, however, is not quite as informal.
The population rather appreciates the positive record of Obama’s National Security that Bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to resurrect its leadership.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is supposed to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with glamour and Gloria.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level, last Tuesday on the Baltic Sea coast under orchestral sound and at the gourmet buffet.
The German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands symbolically turned together the wheel of the valve, which transports the Russian gas to the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline will deliver 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year to Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1,224 km in length connecting the Saint Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, the equivalent of total French consumption, will be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already let the eventuality of building a third line sound on your own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous building looks like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic states.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will enable direct gas to be supplied to Germany, while avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: for them it is now becoming more difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most heavily engaged in the debate, was not afraid to compare the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Scottish pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically extremely sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
This, however, is at the expense of defusing European energy, as the project has struck a breach between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to implement its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, which have strong gas consumption and whose gas reserves are running out.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically," François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out the extent to which the large gas contracts are also important from the political and economic point of view.
All this explains the broad smile of the numerous Gazprom managers in Lubmin regarding gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipe is made of steel with concrete sheathing to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at a depth of about 200 metres.
During their construction, minefields dating from the Second World War had to be avoided.
"About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed for safety reasons," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect fauna and flora.
The line is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted by anything over the entire length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have refrained from it, as the Swedes were not eager to see a Russian state society permanently settle at the level of their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we will close the gas flow in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
This case, however, is regarded by the designers as very unlikely, since the welds were estimated to be resistant to one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured by an underwater robot controlled for external observation purposes from a seagoing vessel, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, with a diameter of one metre, is inserted into the inside of the pipe and moved through the gas pressure.
After three complete days of transport through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides accurate information on possible deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to function for fifty years without having to undergo even the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have united their forces to realize this project.
However, management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated here (each with 15.5%), as are the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (each with 9%).
These five companies have formed a group of companies called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company on a renewable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the volume of gas is transported," Jens Müller specified.
The financing of gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
Total labour costs should amount to EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders have been able to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea at Lubmin on a sandy, pine forested coastal stretch.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas outlet gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other key figures of the incoming gas before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per passing hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Launched about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine now wants to give the letter a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, by candlelight with writing hours spent.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognisable, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the eggshell-colored sides, aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a specialist consultant at the company, is commissioned to market the new product.
The notebook was inspired by a traditional production technique called Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton peck that is used, for example, for upholstery covers.
This type of notebook was very popular among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that was regarded as an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now responsible for brands at Modo Modo.
Success is coming.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a picture of the buyers, as the notebook inspires businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early years, now employs more than 100 employees and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of city centers and understands how to assert its identity.
"We followed the zeitgeist and his new need for writing, which exists despite the upswing of the e-mails," Maria Sebregondi explained.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine company: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a leopard pattern cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine benefited from his success and cultural zeitgeist and was able to diversify his products: bags, schedules, fillers, computer covers... The brand has the full range of articles.
A success that enviously brings to mind: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the Investmentfond SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th Week of Work for the Disabled".
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice the average: 19% compared to 9% of the total population.
Disheartening?
"No, says Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, which organises the "Week of Work for the Disabled".
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still an enormous amount of work to be done."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for disabled unemployed people before they get a job.
Older people are more likely: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no Abitur and only 10,000 disabled people are among the 2.3 million students with higher education qualifications.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% for the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter the labour market and that make up the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the objective brakes.
Remains the unspoken, the attitudes that are certainly but slowly evolving.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre Association for the journal La Cité stated that the managers surveyed had "a weak level of knowledge of the disabled", which was "overrepresented" by "persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disadvantaged".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was laid down in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, dating from 2008, point to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, General Director of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Proof: The number of "fees paid" establishments has decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, created strong pressure on the companies," said Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses a real realization, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the establishments employ disabled workers between 20 and 49 employees, while enterprises with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What luck"
Even before they stood up to the "Blue Tuesday evenings" (8:45 p.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed their pleasure that the friendly game brought them.
It would be too far-fetched to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the audience podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made good and happy peace.
Five months after the spirited gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," the native of Liller assures.
As for the contrast between his representation in club and national elf, "It is a unity that justifies everything."
"I am in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to get started."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought Friday night against Romania in terms of the match against France, to finally "glisten".
However, without neglecting the note of "pleasure".
He started the French national team from the age of 7 and led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This inevitably contributes to strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter even more.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
"We just ran into each other."
"To be able to play against them means great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, made "stolt" sound good-natured.
"The pride of playing a gala match."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in its capacity as "neighbours" - that France "has once again become a team at a very high level", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job," he said excitedly.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician certainly sees himself sharing the plane with the Blues (the French national team) ... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
"We're planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will notice this in the upcoming games." The game against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward with great optimism to the return match against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
Both teams had lacked objectivity during the playoff.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
In fact, for Portugal this means only 90 minutes of bliss.
But there's a match to play, and there's an opponent to serve up, Bosnia.
In view of the play (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to put on the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, since we have not achieved an exit gate".
At home, however, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that even if the game was of course announced as "very close", the optimistic, but clear-sighted Bento said, they will make their way through an audience that is equally at stake.
"We expect a very close match, but we are completely convinced that we can win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to compete at the 2012 European Championship", however the successor of Carlos Queiroz relativized.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win a goal.
A draw can already be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk, as we have not achieved an exit gate," Bento regrets.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese plan to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the very beginning to "don't give them time to think"."
A good idea, provided that it is put into practice this time.
