28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother testified that he can't imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "At last he went uphill again."
The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, reported the San Francisco Medical Department.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, had gotten his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said that they were "shocked and devastated" about his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are at this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things for him finally went uphill."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook something for us, to prepare dinner for us," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any kind of argument.
He was the brother who swam with the stream.
"With everything going wrong in the world, he was this unpolished diamond that glowed brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the SFPD telephone number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star made that clear in an interview.
"I'm always stuck in drawers or glued on labels from the outside that usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself do not want to always be perfect and successful."
"Honestly said, these things are more interesting to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV with loose dutt and Mexican food, according to the magazine.
She asks about the desire to have children: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a breeze" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will be shown in our studio on August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer and some colleagues sought a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their work, they chased home in a fast gallop to the feed troughs.
One kilometer at this speed, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And that's when the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses.
He and his family were led over the ALRV facility, and on a horse he didn't even swung for photo purposes.
Langer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports assistant presented the Golden Sports Pyramid to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala.
The likeable athlete does not lack awards.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already ennobled him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the Sports Pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting success, but also for social commitment."
For decades, Langer has been supporting the young.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master's winner was inducted into the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.
Among the award winners are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gienger, the fencing Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society migrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Clinton's and Trump's economic policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that's what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those small in doubt and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, Trump claims.
He would massively push back regulations, and he is pushing for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, it has opportunities to open up to the disadvantaged and needs money to do so.
That's why the taxes for the rich are increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton almost say that they need to be invested in.
The democratic candidate even announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by Republican state-critical Teaparty wing, for example.
Trump could thus still be the subject of internal party discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more clear.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and restart coal production in the US.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, and he wants to cancel the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand renewable energies with its investment program and demands: "One country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
But not only with regard to infrastructure - also with regard to international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, they do not want to isolate the US from international trade - they just want to protect American jobs better.
They are then to be better paid, for example Clinton demands.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
She wants to raise him to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be up, then he says that it must not be changed.
But the major discussion in the coming months is likely to be about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics accuse him of making the budget deficit even bigger.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich that they pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every refugee woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women fleeing alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby that's only one year old.
One of them put her little son in his arm.
He looks inquisitively into the room with his big eyes.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the managing director of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals, among other things, with the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
In the north of Munich, they live in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It has recently been officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard outside the door.
"It's no exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence while fleeing," says Bahr.
"Men flee for wars because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a bearer of hope," she says.
For women, other reasons for fleeing prevail: "Many steal from it secretly because they see no other way out".
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, compulsion, honor killings, slavery, or forced prostitution.
That's what drives them away.
On the run, this goes on.
"The fact that tugs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water, for example, is not uncommon," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that once they arrive in Germany, the end will be crazy, says Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters are often considered inferior and at worst abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children certainly did not arise voluntarily."
Many women are so used to not saying anything.
"Or they dare not speak openly about what they have experienced, because shame is too great."
Since they often did not know how to help each other, Bahr asks for more accommodation only for them.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.
Some answer no to the question of whether they knew of a project similar to that in Munich in their area of responsibility.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Even in Swabia, only refugees are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman of the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, there are floors or houses in some community accommodation only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
A study published for the Committee states: "It is very important that men and women be kept separate."
"If privacy is missing, or if men and women are accommodated together, violence against women can occur - continuously."
In particular, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, as stated in the study.
How much women feel about this need for protection can be seen from the crowd that exists on the house in Munich.
"Since talking about us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Residents strike: demands for new industrial action measures
Assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new industrial action measures in their disputes concerning a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked its entire council to approve more industrial action measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that ministers had failed to respond to the concerns about the Treaty.
Residents and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the chairman of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "insistently calm" to problems, leading to the rejection of the treaty.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and to request official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board of Directors today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating industrial action that will begin in early September.
The disputes caused interns to strike six times this year, the first total failures in NHS history.
The head of the BMA intern Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 interns and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.
After the vote, health minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced by force.
Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed slim-lipped and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restrained conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "loving friend" Putin - according to a report a whole five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me to be rather the opposite.
But a long-lasting coolness radiated by Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin split up and accused Ankara of falling in the back of Russia.
The offense was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding confidence will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unreserved attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to score some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs, first and foremost, all the friends he can get after he was almost removed from office last month in a failed coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late-seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, national television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists that way, tomatoes that way."
But the visit had added political value to Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West as it regards its response to the attempted seizure of power as a weak response.
In addition, there is the continuing resentment about the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime changes.
The summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present, as an analyst once described to me, an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel rejected by the West and badly treated and now join forces.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that, after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents testified at the press conference that they had not even touched the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
According to the Bank's CEO, the RBS brand is only to be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other consumer financial brands.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used by customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will become more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told the BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to become the bank of brands, because how do we focus internally (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and that we would have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you'll see many changes.
We can re-launch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th profit at Newmarket on Prediction
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th profit
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Prediction, which is coached by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner, Dettori, who won on Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I ended up here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes the cheers when he gets the victory on Prediction
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, won 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernism and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it's his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma inspires fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie at Epsom a few weeks ago that he had already won 6,000 prizes if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has already won almost 30 years in GB, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A whole series of big tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from drugs.
Three years ago, he initially had difficulty returning from his six-month lockdown, but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he is far from finished - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until his 50th year of age or more.
Russia’s Putin Fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Envoy for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In a statement by the Kremlin, Putin stated that without giving any reasons, he had ordered "the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration."
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
On the Kremlin's website (in Russian) it is said that he was later chief of protocol and head of staff of the government staff.
About his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state on draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Convince the smiling faces?
This step has made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works as he did for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff would resign at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced of this - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - you could almost say - for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted most.
Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin’s second term, as Putin’s third term would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming President again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical battle last month on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios producing the series announced their resignation in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his resignation.
On the set there were artistic differences and a disagreement.
I regret the incident," he said in a message.
Details of how Gibson's character is written out of the series following a team of FBI agents are expected to be released at a later date, according to the statement of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been part of the series since the first season of 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart's blood into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there by the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can wish for a show.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28th.
Puzzles about fish that landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sand eels that were spied out by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £ 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blowers" approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 slanted ropes.
The £ 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from country to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire deck is in place, and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth gets a concrete cast for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented building and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road deck and its connection to the north tower deck under construction, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or country side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a gradient of about 3%.
Cheerful, since the tolerances the team is working towards were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "lucky to be alive"
Three men have "lucky to be alive" after being thrown off their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station sounded an alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely, while their boat moved on with their own strength.
"We saw the boat revolve around her and imagined the worst," said the head of Moelfre Vince Jones' rescue station.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach until we left it on water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found hanging on a buoy without life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and unharmed.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it dissipated from the person who steered the boat when the boat capsized.
Someone was watching these men today.
Severely injured - man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured her.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had gotten the key to the apartment to get his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholized perpetrator cut his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
She then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
But she couldn't get him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her companion.
On the street, they met the husband's ex-life mate.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be taken into account much more in future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "action concept for housing" for the next Council meeting.
But argument is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?
So far, there is no regulation.
SPD Group chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We are in agreement with the Greens: Anyone who wants to build on urban areas will have to designate 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in the inventory.
According to Bratmann, however, the big issue in the town hall is: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private spaces?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but as much as possible 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is designed to provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is no agreement between the political groups at the moment."
The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.
The left still wants tough conditions for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann says, the situation on the housing market is worsening.
If the concept of action is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.
But the programme is not yet complete: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how do you compensate for the loss of another approximately 1300 cheap apartments, whose promotion will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, according to the planning policy spokesman Nicole Palm, the city should now purchase expiring bonds.
In addition, consideration should be given to bringing apartments back to price fixing.
This is possible in the western city.
The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.
In the Weststadt, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price fixing for cheap apartments.
Only: the owners, the housing companies do not want that.
For if the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased again, the aim of the so-called mixing is to be removed.
There should be no more concentration of the weak in only a few neighbourhoods.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU has to go on board."
It had concentrated on more building sites for single-family homes.
But this does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go madness, an app based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s (later it produced a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, interest declined slightly before the game was released in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The market launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and, once they are found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured".
A generation who played the game when she was younger joined the delusion and jumped off the sofa to search.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person makes every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of launching the game, the number of tracked people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for increasing performance.
Many public health education campaigns that make people "take 30 minutes to get off the sofa" and "be active every day" came across deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are also grumpy spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk against a door.
What the hell?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity before, they gave us no reason to exercise as this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and the use will decrease over time.
Due to Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with real world activity, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamically on the jumping horse.
Effortless on the beam.
Stunning on the ground.
Brilliant on the whole line.
And now finally also Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the multi-struggle title on Thursday and widened the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of everyone under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
American Simone Biles turns on the suspended beam during the women's single multi-struggle final at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-struggle title and the fifth overall, as she consolidates her reputation as the best of her generation, or even ever.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that didn't go so far between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold returning to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment.
American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver in the women's single multi-struggle tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation at the farewell party of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted that she never planned the future during her long journey to the top, this is not really true.
Part of their ground exercises - which include their typical Tumbling Pass - are adapted to Latin American music, which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
She hasn't lost a multi-fighting competition since the summer of 2013, a winning series that will last as long as Biles wants.
Even if Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture was deceptive.
Floating beams and floor gymnastics - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lurked.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the suspended beam - and put one on the ground with a 15,933.
Raisman gently embraced her as she expected her end - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Bile's shiny red, white and blue eyeliners, when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
Raisman's performance was revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina.
This time the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her ground practice, she threw kiss hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As far as Biles is concerned, the fast-expanding tweet of 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial murder case shot while listening to music in the car
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the most deadly attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial killer case while talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, can be read in the report.
The police reported that the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the purses or $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Sgt. Police spokesman Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks, mainly in Hispanic residential areas within four months.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
It is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died there.
One witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report about the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and which is assumed to be the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge casings and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't get involved with that.
What's wrong at all -- of course, they got involved," she said.
Her husband Vincent and she were told that Edmund might never be able to see her and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that he be institutionalized.
"My first answer was 'I didn't know people were still doing that," Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with a walker.
Edmund could not sit or crawl until his third year of life and he still cannot speak.
But he's making progress.
He can walk with support and ride a bike.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund invented for "Please sing something to me."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and predictions can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis in a long time, because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the cika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, flooding causes rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare the emergency on Friday. More rains are expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, reported the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, stated that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance is already on the way to the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, reported that requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that the community of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is being deployed across large parts of southern Louisiana by Saturday.
The weather service reported that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
A flood warning system was used in southern Alabama on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as it will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas via the rivers that have been trodden.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.
Rescue teams still picked up people from the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those who were rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his house, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water was pouring and pouring in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high point of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family had all disabilities and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency workers saved all three in a large military truck and took them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "expanded rapidly" as there continued to be heavy rainfall and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the soil had been heavily soaked by the rains since Wednesday.
The authorities stated that heavy rains and street flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, both of which were now flooded.
The head of Robby Miller community said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed up by the flood.
Emergency shelters were established in the cities of Amite and Hammond to accommodate the evacuees.
"As soon as the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and sand bags were provided for the inhabitants to take away, hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses are reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but no ones have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "pierced by bullets," survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time this week that a 6-year-old child is shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the loin, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious during his transport to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe this.
The condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the station that he would probably recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, reports the station.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are investigating whether the perpetrators could be among one of the injured men.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridge shells for assault rifles traced back to various assault rifles overshadowed the scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the sidewalk, there were pods.
There seem to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," said police officer Anthony Ginaldi to the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently reporting the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another six-year-old girl was hit by a crossbeat on her arm when she was playing outside her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm thinking of under the women's olympia team in gymnastics for more than one reason.
First, I've been in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring for many young girls of different skin color.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one female gymnast was an Afro-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterly gymastic routines.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fighting event for women.
Aly Raisman won the silver medal.
We experience the top of this sport, but this is not how gym classes look all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same route as Aly and Madison to make it to the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five", because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. Besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnasts are an expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily in private gymnasts maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).The list can be continued at will.
The majority of these gymnastic clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive all their training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must allow the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to have a more affordable and more accessible gymnastic training.
I founded my 20-year gymnastic foundation.
At my events we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, grab so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Residents want to organise more strikes after they've rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 interns voting in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the contract and said that the NHS would be in a "no-man's country" and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first interns are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Doctors, announced last night in a statement: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes through talks met with reluctance to participate in the government and sometimes with deafening silence.
That was the promise Jeremy Hunt made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the charge and address the interns' concerns."
Should he not do so, the interns have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April provided for a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to provide cover for doctors on the strike post chain.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 interns who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS staff, called on the interns to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Arbeitskampfnahme achieve nothing of the only little, but already overloaded teams and service providers burden and only cause the patient, caregivers and their families worries, distress and interruption."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the committee of interns and responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that continuing positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a career break, training skills, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how serious it was for employers, the UK Health Education and the Ministry of Health to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-per day medication that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day medication after the authorities have recommended that more people administer it for a longer period of time.
Ticagrelor, an anticoagulant medicine, reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS regulatory authority NICE has recommended a four-year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulatory authority NICE has recommended a four-year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls that form coverings.
When the plaque breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The draft guide for NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice-daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With a preliminary recommendation from ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness makes electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the initiative of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud being knowingly ignored in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and councillors for ignoring evidence of abuse of the election due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now a king of corruption, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barriers outside electoral booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should have an ID card with them to prove their identity in elections.
At present, a voter only has to give his name and address.
The report proposes that non-removable ink be applied to a person's finger when they cast their vote in order to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in eastern London.
Last year, a Special Electoral Court ruled that Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which a person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
In particular, he expressed alarm at the fraudulent postal election - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including holding IDs to prove the identity
His report states: "As proof, it has been suggested that pressure has been put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that state institutions knowingly ignored such behaviour due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban on political activists processing postal ballot papers to stop "election harvests".
The report, considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before the election.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger once she has cast her vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
A three-year limit on requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibition for political activists to process full postal elections and envelopes of postal elections.
Give the police the power to set up a lockdown to set up election stations.
An amendment to the law that facilitates an accusation of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksvertretungsgesetz 1983).
No photography in election stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the election stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensifying training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for due to a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty due to a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "check-ups" of the election registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said, "The court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, bears a proud legacy, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten this reputation.
Crazy about Kate's bicyclist doppelganger and other famous doppelganger of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio got out of line this week with the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who proved to be an impressive double of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But 24-year-old Olympionikin is by far not the only gold fighting athlete with his own famous doppelganger this summer - at least not if you can believe the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympics that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood fame.
The Hunter and the Wolf: U.S. team member in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
The U.S. team member in archery Brady Ellison caused a rush on Twitter after pictures of him looking like the Wolf of Wall Street Star showed up.
In fact, the archer got the insanity of social media and admitted that he had heard since his childhood that he looked like Leo.
"I don't see much likeness myself, except for facial hair," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly come to the fore this year: the striking similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a doppelganger for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared with Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One passage higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athlete version" of the Inception actor
Another lasting comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just the sun-tanned skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to resemble an "athlete version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar facial shape and eyes
Not the only one: a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory put in space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar facial shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in gymnastics Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, broad smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m freestyle swimming squadron outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypian Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer went "like Mief" and died like "a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he made his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swim relay.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS's commentator team to give more "color," could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost her connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the squadron 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canadians to unlock the gap with China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"????
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m freestyle swim relay for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost her connection, baby."
Criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, with a lot of people talking about him.
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize that the comment on a swim performance was broadcast."
It was an unfortunate phrase, we're sorry it happened."
CBC finally apologized more than 90 times to the people who responded to the comments on Twitter
Commentator colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been made possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers last night and our followers on social media.
To clarify one thing, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unhappyly chosen wording. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swim squadron in the CBC Olympics program, he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyer in Primark indignant about woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of business
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try on underpants.
In order to worsen the situation, she patterned how she looked in it, took her off and put her back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and tried out four pairs of underpants in a store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried on her underpants before putting them back on the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried on her underwear, "she got dressed again and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants out of the display, took off her own tights and trousers and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky as Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she took off her underpants again, which she obviously didn't like, as she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three more underpants before finally deciding that she didn't like anything, got dressed again and went out.
"She didn't seem to mind seeing anyone - or thinking about the person who might be buying the underpants she had tried on."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underwear that was wearing another person and was not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "As I learned, the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman wore them and took them off again and they weren't washed."
A spokesman from Primark said, "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our Folkstone branch on Tuesday, August 9."
All eligible products were withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself against weapons attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether you're approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the tables for your robber.
If you are approached from behind, then you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit him in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him in the groin with your knee and twist the gun out of his hands as the attacker bends in pain. Hit him in the face with the run and move backwards as they point the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, put the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and pointing the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi pretends.
But remember, it's safest to hand over your money to a robbery unless you're a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright shuffles his tongue in the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
A British traveller subjected his immune system and gagging reflex to a serious test - licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his train on a Euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flush button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's going to get into.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The thought of licking the flush button of a pull room that has already been used by thousands of others may be totally repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his bowels by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at railway stations to flush buttons of toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a test
In the film, he said, "As a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud."
In the film, he definitely did justice to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample swab showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after their luminometer count was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the movie, he says, "It's close to the worst thing I smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did some crazy brainstorming that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think that the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 per cent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent stated that they at least occasionally use products containing attached lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before delogation Social home in Saltash, Cornwall
An antisocial family left their social home after a delogation with a damage of £50,000 because they terrorized their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were forcibly removed from their estate, shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden planks were torn open, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.
The family have been resettled and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for Cornwall Housing's house management, said that she was afraid that the apartment would no longer be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here, and I think that people don't have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be regarded as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who had been living in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror the family had inflicted included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, quarreling and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down, old garbage has been found
The wooden planks were torn open in the estate where drugs were traded in the past.
Neighbors testified that they saw them fighting on the street and that the police had to be called regularly
Cornwall Housing forcibly delogated her and her partner from the estate this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily move out.
The delogation was hailed by relieved neighbors who said that their lives were made hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, stated that the family had failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
Garbage and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the community house
He added, "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for her behavior and that of her family, as delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into consideration.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horribly watched by their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will comfort some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation
Home administration workers will now have to clean up garbage mountains that surround the house
In 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis, scales, paraphernalia and cash worth £1,700.
Skeldon was fined after guilty of possession of a Class B drug.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now believed to be living in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were covered with graffiti.
The police say she's going to delog tenants who don't follow the house rules
Angela Crow from the Devon and Cornwall police reported that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This goes to those who think that they can behave without self-proclaiming, as well as to those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after a deep-flying military jet flies over the beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A portugisiese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force made an incredible dive
Air forces reported it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment when frightened tourists start to panic after a low-flying jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost within reach over the sun worshipers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming to them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said, "It flew by twice really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on Aveiro beach were panicked when the plane came out of the dark and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese air force reported today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so low that this was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said that due to poor visibility due to nearby fires, the jet flew a little lower than usual, but the air forces insisted that safety was not endangered at any time.
This summer, land fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal, where four people died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force reported today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - which reduced his visibility
The plane was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worries against Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans compete in a duel for the Spanish Supercup away against FC Sevilla, and the return match increases three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner has to give up Neymar, who is competing with Brazil in the Olympic football tournament, in terms of strength measurement with the defeated cup finalist and reigning European League champion among others.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a ligament dive in his knee during training, which at least for the time being clarified the one question at Barca in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for status as number one in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique thus far gave up a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen took the lead in most other competitions.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, there are doubts at the Spanish champion about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0:4.
Lionel Messi and Co. did not really convince at the 3:2 rehearsal gallop against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Seville, on the other hand, has to digest the 2-3 defeat after an extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and aims for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Olympic table tennis champion.
The 27-year-old defeated Zhang Jike 4:0 in a one-sided final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
With this, the world rankings first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Finals and Olympic Games.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it to the final game as expected and made up the title among themselves.
It was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SVS-NÖ legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, and between the sets and time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had withdrawn to the grandstands and let loose their protégés in a fair competition on their own.
"I played the matches up here for my country."
"I play for myself in the finals," Zhang had consistently said.
After the match, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
After that, he set the pace on the record and left Zhang only 13 points.
Due to Ma's superiority, the expected rousing match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there were enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the match for bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter-finals, the Belorusse had contracted a rib injury against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then in medical care, had to "lastly" content with sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympic fourths in a similar high table tennis age.
Donald Trump admits “violent problems” in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. republicans is plagued by massive concerns about losing its majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment in which the usually large - tracked and confident multimillionaire expressed some concern, as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are now growing.
"We have tremendous problems in Utah," Trump said to evangelical Christians who he asked for support in major states such as Ohio, Florida, or Virginia.
Guilts were false reports of his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media scheming.
Republic strongholds wobble
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a June survey conducted by SurveyUSA, Trump and his Democratic competitor, Hillary Clinton, were equal.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered vulnerable.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump replied to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance again: "Just as I have done so far."
And pushed afterwards: This will be "either successful, or I will make a very very nice, long holiday".
He does nothing but "tell the truth."
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is fine, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump Party is said to have threatened to cancel funds to support its election campaign if it is unable to present better survey results.
Instead, the Republican candidates were to be given more support for the Congress.
Olympia: Dreary fraud in doping testing
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's track and field athlete is facing trouble after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the team management of Kenya by the doping inspectors.
The IAAF has requested information from the IOC on the case in order to carry out its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman reported.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an evaluation," said an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, handed in the sample and signed it," said Kenya's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become World Cup fourth in Beijing over 800 metres in 2015.
Four days earlier, Kenya's head of athletics, Michael Rotich, had been removed from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed athletes of his country's upcoming doping tests against money payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping crimes.
The announcement of the more than 2000 Doping Target Controls launched by the IOC prior to the Rio Games has unusually pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia are particularly targeted.
Before the Summer Games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics.
As a result, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose doping efforts comply with the rules of WADA.
Kenya is considered a big runner nation.
The country's athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
A number of TV reports by the ARD have repeatedly raised allegations that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is supposed to be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It has been demonstrated that this sport has been extensively and systematically adopted.
Russia's athletes were then excluded from the Summer Games.
Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare's year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as tragic lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With it a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
Artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and fulfilled a dream of youth with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her love with Tony with melancholy, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because it is musically extraordinary!
And then there's Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she's smart, of course naive, and very passionate.
"It is very similar to me, to my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's a tremendously generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
These are the same subjects, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing is that - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - prevent people from ever making this decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain with Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of an election victory
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Judge at the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a conference call that he expected Clinton to select Garland "with some degree of certainty".
A spokesperson for Reid later said that he hadn't talked to Clinton yet if she would nominate Garland and he would speculate.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, were minions and assistants to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidency.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and men"
The Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
At the beginning of this year, the editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us that his nude magazine differs from Oldschool playboys because "Playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the Calendar does.
"We must return to the representation of timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release on the Kalendar's release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community reckons with mass exodus
"Anyone who does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, chair of the Gülen-nahen Stiftung Dialog und Welt.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of protection seekers to flee from Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even be "some hundred thousand", believes the president of the association Ali Toprak.
Due to the tough action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term with several hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight against minorities and the democratic opposition," says Ali Toprak, president of the Association of the "World" of Friday.
Because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with criminal actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds were fleeing within Turkey.
After the foiled coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start over in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that itself receives refugees produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevi cities.
Erdogan wanted to increase the pressure to leave the Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or displaced in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association demanded that the federal government "position itself as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters".
In Germany, too, there is a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionists.
The branding as Gülen supporters destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Who does not adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-affiliated foundation Dialogue and Education, the "world".
According to the newspaper, using figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already represented the largest group of asylum seekers in Germany before the coup due to political persecution.
As of 30 June, this was 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all those recognised as asylum-licensed (39.625).
This survey does not include those fleeing war, poverty or lack of prospects.
Asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively politically, i.e. from the state, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go to where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the state elections will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's not any more stupid than it is: summer holidays, heat and state elections - that bites itself.
The locals, who are to be convinced by the campaigners, are on vacation.
Most holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.
There are also practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end up counting out voices are only laborious to find.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has to pass the election campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can say so, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, which has been the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
What becomes exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what ultimately remains suitable for coalitions.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, is making an almost inconspicuous election campaign, you can't see from his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary wortkarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the AfD's flourishing.
Her refugee policy, her "we can do this" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which is probably going to cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU, with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it's like to campaign in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major demonstrations; Merkel's parliamentary constituency is in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it does not hurt anyone from other parts of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign stands on marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
That, says Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union, too, has noticed that you are breaking the ground in the countryside, that it must make a great effort to find a link with the people again.
She is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the vastness of the country hardly exists.
The council of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his fellow fighters is, however, self-explaining: "You have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village parties, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to launch a particularly committed campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were last behind partner CDU (25) with 22 percent and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the state parliament.
They turn holiday distress into a modern virtue and, to a large extent, transfer their campaign to the Internet.
"Online campaign", the state chairman Claudia Müller calls it.
Otherwise, green campaigners are looking for local voters among holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is curving through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and still finds it beautiful.
Your impression: "Electional leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no punishment".
B27-Renovation: Restaurants suffer from closure
There is nothing to complain about the speed at which the B 27 is being rehabilitated.
For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end at 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
"They've done everything pretty tough," Elvira Tetzlaff tells us about the jet petrol station.
It's a super team.
There's no delay either.
At the beginning of the week, the construction site could be moved to the south as planned, and everything is expected to be ready by the end of October.
It also commends the concessions of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up temporary entrances.
Since the construction site migrated to the south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has thus again existed, the traffic situation within the town has relaxed.
The citizens can now return to the B 27 from Ofterdingen on both sides.
The evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.
"Some of the complaints were considerable," says Florian King, Deputy Head of the Department responsible for the traffic management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many Schleichwege sought out and trusted their navigation rather than the signage.
As a result, some trucks got frayed in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were also not complied with, the municipality demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been considerable overruns," says King, who made himself aware of the situation on the spot.
There have already been flashes of two to three per minute.
The fastest was in the Tempo-30 zone at 77 kilometers per hour.
Since the construction site moved on, however, it has become quieter.
For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Businessmen don't like to look at the cards.
But the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to a drop in sales for them lets everyone you ask see through it.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produce for other companies, for whom the reorganization has hardly any consequences.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest slight decline" at the Maier dealership, but also admits that of course "the running clientele is missing".
The most crowded are the restaurants along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
It's already life threatening.
Not only him, but all the restaurants had hit it hard.
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro sales.
He puts the loss of sales at "over 50 percent".
The road renovation had "thrown back" its operation "by two years".
He had to release half of his staff.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half of them were fired, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, the President of the Government, Jörg Schmidt, replied to a question from Göhner, whether there could be financial compensation, with the indication that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the renovation.
Göhner knows from other counties where something like this was handled more generously.
In all the lawsuits, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regulars are now less frequent due to the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clients will come back after the renovation works have been completed.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that's brutal.
In the name of combating terrorism, laws are constantly being bolted.
After the recent attacks, Minister de Maizière now presents a large security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the conciliator.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior when presenting his new security package.
They don't overwhelm anyone.
Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he was interested in results and in a "achieveable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière let some time pass before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, targeted: that a new security authority should take care of cracking encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière is starting a second attempt at proposals that had not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to penalise sympathy for terrorist groups and adopt the German passport for jihadists with dual citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
Nevertheless, he considers this reasonable and also does not demand anything that does not have any chances for the coalition partner anyway.
De Maizière also presents some new ideas.
Some of them have it in them: he plans rapid procedures for deportations and more possibilities for the detention of people before deportation.
Refugees who are brought to the country in a targeted manner should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
He wants to make some of them even worse in the case of refusals for asylum seekers than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some things are still unexplained and leave questions unanswered.
And on some points - for example, when treating patients unequally - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that deeply occupied the people could not be excluded even during election campaigns.
Internal security has become an enormous focus.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are electoral campaigns to take place.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking a position on the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, the two parties have gone a long way.
First a nasty dispute about the equipment of the federal police, then about a security policy collection of some Union interior ministers, in which the department heads also demand a burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière also strives here for conciliatory tones.
He doesn't think of a departure from the double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
It would not make sense to re-open them.
And with a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "acceptable" for the coalition partner, still has to be shown.
There's a lot in it that could cause a fight.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to gain a profile on the issue of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel signals a cautious willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
Volkswagen is still getting through.
Despite diesel scandals, delivery figures are rising worldwide.
But it doesn't go well in all markets.
There's a vortex about a term in the recall campaign.
Volkswagen will start its deliveries in the second half of the year in a more restrained manner.
Europe's largest car manufacturer continues to show a plus in the course of the year, despite the diesel affair thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
But in July, the core VW brand weakened, especially in Western Europe, thus again burdening the total sales, as the company listed in the Dax reported.
The VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles worldwide in July with 449100 cars than in the same month last year.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent below the same month of the previous year.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost one-sixth.
Brand Sales Manager Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, there was a reluctance to buy in some core markets through "changed economic framework conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to withdraw from the EU had also been burdened, explained a spokeswoman.
In the USA, where the exhaust gas affair first escalated, there is also still a minus.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
All in all, the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony is still coming through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a delivery drop of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is to be booked.
Group Sales Manager Fred Kappler continued to show a sales increase from January to July.
At this time, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles, with 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had rigged exhaust tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars for retrofitting into the workshops.
In the course of the conversion VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles there was no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The car manufacturer issued the customer a "guarantee-like" certificate after the conversion, but did not speak of a "guarantee", as it was said on Friday in business circles.
The reason for this was legal subtlety.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for upgraded diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Department of Transport confirmed that there was a meeting.
"VW has to fully meet the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."
"Differences from this are not accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has taken over the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion and that all vehicle values relevant to the type approval will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", as it was called in business circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, half a year after the conversion, customers will come to a workshop with engine damage - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interest of customers, it is also important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the flue gas scandal resulting in uncertainty about possible warranty regulations, as it was said.
VW therefore does not use the term "guarantee".
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will demand fine interest from wealthy savers in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on current or daily money accounts."
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers "do not have to fear to pay penalty interest for their austerity money".
When banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4% penalty rate.
This fee will be charged to Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September onwards by private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on current or day-to-day money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," said Paul.
For some time now, he has been paying EUR 40 million, which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he cannot exploit.
"They're in my central bank account and cost 0.4 percent," said the bank's chief.
"I can't lay down 4000 euros for every million."
He now passed on the costs according to the polluter-pays principle.
Leaving the cash simply in the vaults of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberies, I don't want the fifth!" said the bank board.
Most customers had understanding and changed to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy stance is causing considerable costs for all banks."
To carry them alone is "permanently not possible".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or bank transfers.
Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014 with penalty interest for deposits of over three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect retail customers to have to pay charges for deposits across the board; competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong for this."
A banker said that there is "a clientel at Lake Tegern, which is a little more luxuriant with wealth".
"This can be a problem for a small bank" if they keep money free.
The cooperative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria "are currently not known to any other banks that charge a replacement for deposits from private customers," said Spokesman Ernst.
At the end of June, Uwe Fröhlich, President of the Federation of German People's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), stated: "The threshold to go negative towards private customers is very, very high."
Competition is tough and there is a threat of investors moving to competition.
Customers in Germany will not like this in the broadest sense.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
Before you rush to the comment section to oversaw it under the pseudonym NotAllSolitaryMenMiddle Ages with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-spoken resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a plate are likely to be between 45 and 54 years old.
Indeed, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horde of hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers tend to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and scurrying wildly before I stand still, holding my hands and saying something decisive like, "Well, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, who I follow from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is one day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they appeared and buy again items he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things that I was probably a little young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding, "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media horn, people who have heard about the comeback and who see themselves moved to buy their old records again.
From the conversations that I have had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
That would explain the boom in the followers of the plate revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took a push on the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, objects that evoke happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
That's the way it is with me as a collector, and I think that's the way it is with many people.
It is an easy way to deal with yourself spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" a staff member flutes from a stack of plates.
A April ICM survey revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not heard it yet.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried as I browse through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone just came in here and said, "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-heavy, less music-heavy.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not older ones, who're just getting in.
Fopp, who devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a more colorful audience than I am going in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's newest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz roars out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers.
None of them look very lonely, but gnawing psychic traumas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for a few minutes and is looking at the variety of plates for sale.
She's more of a shop window shopper than a big shopper.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is..." she drives off with a sigh in love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to be looking at the jeans hotpants, I'm watching a group of young teen girls group around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure record art.
But given that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like plates.
Even though my research revealed that YouGov's results are correct, they do not take into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning strolling through the record shops of Berwick Street and leafing through records, while avoiding the staring look of an eerie, 30-year-old fake moderator standing over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientifically, the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates sharks, says that the record was in a female who is assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects offer to demolish shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to throw down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should have the power to tear down 72 provisional shops where people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who ran the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the prefecture's concerns were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the low tear was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is run in a non-profit way and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
A letter to the Guardian stated that the closure "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in newcomers during the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains militant
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, cycling pro Tony Martin does not want to let himself be defeated.
"I keep an eye on the World Cup, remain confident and keep fighting," wrote the 31-year-old on Facebook before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
He doesn't have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place in the sugar loaf.
"To be honest, it's hard for me to comment on yesterday's time trial," Martin said.
He had to calmly analyse the reasons for the debacle.
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the World Time Trial Championships in Qatar in October.
"I'll take a close look at everything we've changed lately."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-timer world champion, who had lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday on the 54.5 km.
Olympics: Tennis pros Sieggemund missed semi-finals
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarterfinals of Rio: The world rankings 32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA no.
34) the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegegemund, which was plagued by back problems, could only make its impact once and seemed powerless compared to the previous laps.
On Thursday Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the British woman Johanna Konta (No. 10).
Tommy Haas was the last German professional tennis player to win a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of summer games had last been held in 1992.
Never before was a German duo in an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group joins start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
Microsoft did not tell us on Thursday how much money is going for the takeover.
Beam was only launched in January with its offer and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions and face enemies and provide equipment to players.
The game giant Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event Facebook is to help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The start-up, which has been based in Seattle, Washington, USA, is moving to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, as Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi announced.
Therefore, nothing should change for the customers through the takeover.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought in 2014 by online retailer Amazon - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of Google's mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's speedometers need to be adapted to the next generation: In various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are being tested, which are supposed to transmit speed indicators particularly effectively.
For example, Vitronic's futuristic enforcement trailer from Wiesbaden can be used at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is often no necessary infrastructure at motorway construction sites or to renovate bridges with a temporary speed limit to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary speed camera.
However, a permanent mobile setup can be too dangerous or costly.
The enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
Laser measurement technology also allows all vehicles to be simultaneously recorded over several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans according to time, lanes and vehicle category can also be monitored.
According to the manufacturer, you can move the trailer with any car with trailer coupling in the raised condition.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels in the armored and, by the way, also bullet-proof outer shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the speed camera from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and is now also used.
Also foreign authorities flash with the new technology: France recently ordered 100 units, after an order of 150 units last year.
Britain brings silver in 7-man rugby after Fiji Masterclass brings gold
The impressive performance of Britain in 7 rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, rearrangement, line running and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the best shape in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Britishman will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way to go.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game of the Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one thing here.
This slopp will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks of GBs bounce off out of fun.
It felt like running on buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau was in the corner.
With another four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A magnificent tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to reach a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute of play time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou made his way through another weak tackle of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental mid-term changes and closed the Fijian gap...for a whole four minutes, which was good for the ratios of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interim play of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been in favor of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing on the grandstand.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked smashed into the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a tight semi-final match - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal below the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to win the row by fighting with the coach's cancer
There will be no more emotinal gold than in these games, and that means something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard hieves that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the two who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams was all-present when they rowed for the second Olympic gold in two without a tax wife in a row, the first women in the history of British sport who set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, at least their 39th undefeated commitment, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the kind of triumph.
Behind every gold in the rudder is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference, and there was no one more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he's risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to be able to start treatment in early 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if this is the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital running around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. It may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thank you goes to him.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to open up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped at the moment.
Helen shouted, "Stay in trial, stay in trial."
It's really important not to be carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking for something great to do.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover has to appear at a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed out.
Here it took about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the "Veitensteingruppe" water association, Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is regarded as "Bavarian-wide exemplary".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
For example, some time ago the original sound was said in a contribution by Bayerischer Rundfunk.
A little later, the Water Forum of the government of Lower Franconia recognized the association of purposes.
The work of the Veitenstein Group was regarded as exemplary in Bavaria.
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the Zweckverband Mitarbeiter, of which 28 years as managing director.
He was retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water each year and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and Baunach are members.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water waiter in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband as early as 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance to office and organisational activities, budgeting, calculating fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," said the chairman.
As outstanding events she mentioned the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renovation of water pipes.
There had been no stoppage at all and innovations had been taken up again and again because water meant life and drinking water was the most important food.
In her laudatory speech, she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable and correct service for 31 years.
He has committed himself with a lot of heart blood to his water-purpose association and he has lived the water-purpose association literally, as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the Veitenstein Group's success concept for nitrate reduction in front of the Water Forum of the district of Unterfranken.
He had received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
For his part, Rupert Göller praised Wasserwart Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best water waiter and he was a faithful squire.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the special purpose association as highlights.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3rd.
Here it was necessary to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the high container from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with the autism of her son Tiago - and addresses other affected parents: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the illness was recognized by her son, she believed she had to die.
However, the now eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example, if I ask him something that was two years ago when I sang at La Scala in Milan, he doesn't remember anything," said Netrebko.
But he's the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Beziehungsstat in Bargteheide - Man shoots at life mate
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at a multi-family house in Bargteheide, Stormarn County, at 10:45 a.m. on Friday and killed her.
"The man himself called us and claimed to have shot his life partner," said a police spokesman.
The perpetrator is on the run, after him are publicly searched.
Now nationwide, because Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about six feet tall, muscular, tanned and bald.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
It's a few years old, though.
In the meantime, the man is bald.
The man is not to be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, according to the police.
If you see Sven S., call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relationship act."
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide any information on the origin of the act or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a homicide."
"That's all we're saying right now," said a police spokesman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was on the scene.
Steel - bright outlook for the German steel industry
The crisis-ridden and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared additional costs of millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity promotion are off the table.
The exemption from the renewable energy levy for existing plants for so-called in-house electricity production in the German steel industry will continue, said Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I'm really glad that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption to pay for it.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there was now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks would an EEG surcharge of 20 percent be incurred.
However, this was not raised in the steel industry either.
The IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on its own electricity generation.
This largely establishes the status quo of the current regime.
Gabriel's successful efforts were particularly important for the steel industry.
"With regard to our campaign 'Steel is the future', this is a first step."
"Others must follow."
"Climate and employment targets must also be weighed in the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation worsened further when China, the world's largest producer, threw massive steel onto the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.
European producers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
In the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat.
On the one hand, import duties imposed have an impact on imported steel, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable price recovery is.
The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Finally, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the same month of the previous year, as reported by the Steel Association on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced declined for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent lower than in the previous year.
The association expects an increasing output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing is good for seniors
Ursel Kipp has accompanied singing her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's degree she took up the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels more balanced, happy and alive overall, she says.
By the way, she does something good for her health and her spirit.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors right from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
By being together regularly, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp has also made this experience in her choir: "To discuss and organize, to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of their breath so quickly even in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Group of Senior Citizens' Organisations.
In the older generations, singing together had a much higher priority; it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs evokes many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song lyrics and especially melodies, even demented people remember long-standing events.
When singing, the head is also required a special performance, explains Lenz.
Focusing at the same time on one's own voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not just focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get from singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
So there are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join them.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the congregation or the church head directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you don't have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbors for help in searching the Internet.
If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitively than hangovers to cries of young animals
In Hanover, biologists have investigated the effect of calling cat babies to adult animals.
To her surprise, the Meowen did not leave the males cold either - however, they behaved in contrast to the females always the same.
Female cats can recognize the arousal level of cat babies on the meows of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens who feel in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary University and the Medical University Hannover (MHH) found out.
Cats also react to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"The acoustic differences between the meows of less and strongly excited young animals are either not perceptible or not significant for males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the lead author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of the kitten screams differ with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult males and eight kittens from the MHH's animal husbandry were observed.
For one thing, they were played by little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were additionally lifted up.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All females, even those who did not yet have their own offspring, reacted differently to the screams," said Konerding.
They turned to the speaker faster when this call of the more excited kittens played.
This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noise in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski grabs Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match takes place again in Turkey.
Before the match between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is on the agenda.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the overthrow attempt in July, the government stated that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the coup attempt.
Even before football is not stopped.
The prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
So Süküri, now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days still applies until October, in fact this has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy guards" in public places throughout the country declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.
Like the whole country, sport is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Fans of the Besiktas Workers' Club in particular are traditionally not among the president's friends.
What unites the majority of Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
Lukas Podolski will be the winner of the cup "Gala".
The Kölner proved his sporting value in the past season: With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as a top scorer of his club.
In the final against Fenerbahce he scored the 1-0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best in the place."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion reached a conciliatory conclusion.
After the pre-round knockout in the Champions League, the Lions also left the Europa League early on.
In the Süper Lig it was only sixth place.
The season wasn't good.
The trophy was the only way to win.
"We did this and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the season went better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the base for the 14th title with 26 goals in the season as Süper-Lig-Torschützenkönig.
This is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
After the coup attempt, Gomez had announced that he would not return to Besiktas because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the specialist magazine "Kicker" Club CEO Fikret Orman.
To do this, however, the striker should be prepared to waive about a third of his annual salary estimated at EUR 7.5 million, Orman stated: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence".
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medal chances at the Olympic Games in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already detained twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanova is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other convicted athletics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping continues to determine the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Juliana Jefimova, who had claimed her right to start shortly before the games after a doping lock, was mercilessly whistled out and booed out at her start (100 meters chest).
There was a bizarre scene: with a smile on her face, she was still strutted into the hall and provoked with her performance.
When it became clear that she was not going to get gold, the audience broke out into a cheering storm.
However, there are many other athletes who are going to start at the Olympic Games in Rio despite the past doping.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100 m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was already banned twice due to dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic champion and ex-World Champion have run even faster than before, he is number one in the world over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100 m relay/Jamaika): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit a six-month lockdown in 2010 after she was shown to take the painkiller oxycodone.
She had severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic Champion of 2012, World Champion of 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positively for the banned stimulant agent methylhexamine.
Perkovic denied knowing ingestion and was suspended for six months.
The four furthest litters this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and closed for 21 months.
A penis enlargement agent was responsible, Merritt affirmed.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 metres is the fastest man in the world to date.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Hardly any athlete was able to withdraw so many medals afterwards.
Tichon lost his World Championship title in 2005 nine years later, after being diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to make Olympic silver in 2004 due to steroid doping and the 2006 EM title due to testosterone abuse.
He was awarded the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the International Court of Sport CAS.
==References====External links==*Official website
Liu Hong (20 km of walking, China): The world record holder and gold favourite was only tested positively in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old World Champion found evidence of the use of a banned dietary supplement, the ban of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was mild and expired on 13 July.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, on Friday morning.
She had suffered cut wounds and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave.
She planned to travel home in early September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also affect Austrian citizens is still unclear for the time being.
According to Schnöll, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard.
In Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs exploded in an outing district on Thursday evening.
According to the police, one Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two explosives went up again, and another man was killed according to the authorities.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.
At the detonation near Patong beach, popular with holidaymakers, a taxi driver was injured according to police reports.
In Surat Thani, on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the IED was blown up in a flower bed in front of the coastal police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast caused several injuries.
One assumes a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The bombings bear the same signature," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee in front of journalists on Friday morning.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It was too early to comment on possible motives - but it was probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities had received intelligence information about imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed of the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment areas.
In Thailand there are always smaller bombings, but they are not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin there is a palace that has been used for years by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on its homepage recommends that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be strictly followed.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After conflicts between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, no necessary travel to these provinces is advised.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applied to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence also in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military unta, which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody riots, benefits itself from having brought the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not managed to control the revolt of Muslim rebels that has been smouldering in the far south of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.
The right-wing "identitarian movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several state offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government have also placed the group under observation.
"In the 'Identitarian Movement', we see evidence of efforts against the liberal democratic basic order," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
In this way, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes "multicultural delusions", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through alienation".
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identitarians".
Maaßen said that his authority had closely aligned itself with the state authorities in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the head of constitutional protection.
In general, extremists try to speak to them in a language suitable for young people, often with pop music.
This would be done by Islamists as well as by right-wing extremists.
It's not a covert advertisement for your own cause.
The propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "identitarian" to AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of that.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind were only relevant from a certain point on.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its direction by certain people who are extremist, and thus becomes extremist.
The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This was not apparent.
In view of the significant increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maaßen said that he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have noted in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It may well be that further right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups are forming, which are planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, it was not apparent that there was a European-wide or European-wide governance of legal terrorism.
The previous groups had emerged at regional level or on social networks.
Concerned, Maaßen said that many assaults were carried out by people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That is the cause of concern.
Many suspects in attacks on asylum shelters had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"Many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right-wing extremists before, who were perhaps politically indifferent or who, for example, chose CDU, SPD or left, but who then radicalized themselves through right-wing extremist moods."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Haste becomes an internet hit
Not always the Olympics or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This is shown by the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the clip was selected.
In the social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a 48-second lag and finished 59th in 59th place.
But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian got a special starting right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming more popular in under-represented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
Quickly the first nicknames made the round.
Some media called him the "Robel of the Whales".
The English tabloid "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him following a "well-being belly".
His time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played no role there.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the race of Eric Moussambani attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a 100-meter freestyle preliminary run.
Moussambani was then cheered for Frenetically.
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.
A headquarters in the front row on the stunning architecture of the Central Library of Los Angeles
Learn more about the history of the central library in the city centre, as the Society of Architectural Historians/Southern California Chapter holds a salon with Arnold Schwartzman and Stephen Gee, the authors of the new book "Los Angeles Central Library: A History of its Art and Architecture".

Geretsried - The owner of a shop in the New Square has been stolen.
According to the police, 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her shop at around 5.30 p.m. on Monday, forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she came back the next morning at 8.15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the impending defeat of the election so closely
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
Should the election as US President not be a thing, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He'll just go on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential elections in November, he would not care: "Lastly it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV channel CNBC.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is fine, Trump said.
He called US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton the founder of the Islamic State Terrorist Militia (IS).
Within his party more and more resistance was formed.
Post is entering the trade in electric vans
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is apparently great.
The Post is planning to sell their electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
The Group intends to start trading with the transporter shortly.
From next year, the Post will also offer its electric vans on the free car market.
"We want to enter the sale to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
The company has been testing for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which delivers letters and packages, to other companies.
Post Executive Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always requests, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn-based company wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly.
The company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift in its own post-factory.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long term started a complete conversion to the environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will make a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're moving the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's streets since 2014.
GfK leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes all the more uncertain the longer the successes promised by him are not.
Turbulence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After another disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the world's number five in the industry is facing a new start in terms of personnel.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management board member Gerhard Hausruckinger already took over the management board as early as September 1st, the company announced.
He is to officially assume the role of "executor" until a successor is found for Hartmann.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesman did not want to mention details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
Investors said on Friday that shareholders had recently been disappointed about the continuing lack of success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of the GfK since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible after 5 years," it said.
In view of the recently poor GfK business figures, each shareholder eventually becomes restless.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same," it said.
After setbacks in the previous quarters, the company had not been able to stop its loss journey in the second quarter of 2016.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent lower than in the same quarter of the previous year.
Sales declined by 3.4 percent to EUR 721.2 million in the first half of the year.
Profits in the second quarter were mainly impacted by the decline in the company's value in the face of its difficult economic situation.
The goodwill write-downs of EUR 139 million, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience division, brought the Group a net loss of EUR 148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had still generated consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhörn in Graben: Eight injured
In the event of an accident of a coach with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered severe injuries, the police reported.
According to her data, the 66-year-old driver of the bus from a Eisenach company had to avoid a renegade truck, which was partly on the opposite track.
The bus left the road to the right and slipped into a ditch, according to a police spokesman Aurich/Wittmund.
"Due to the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire department freed the inmates.
Six ambulances and one ambulance came to the scene of the accident on Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured travellers were taken back to the Krummhörn district of Pewsum by a bus.
There they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and any witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of waste water will be 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl waste water plant from 1 October 2016; 3.36 euros for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp (previously 2.26 euros) and 3.64 euros for Azendorf (previously 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater charge will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.
According to a comprehensive calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the household by the Landratsamt Kulmbach revealed that there were sub-coveries for these waste water plants.
On the basis of legal bases, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities cost-covering.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into their wallets.
Fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As administrative director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the board, a recalculation of the fees for the waste water facilities of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and under-coveries from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
The serious increases in fees were due to Schmidt's fact that all three waste water plants were relatively small facilities with a very small waste water supply, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
For example, due to the small distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the volume of waste water in all three plants is slightly down.
Furthermore, in the previous calculation period, all three plants incurred considerable renovation and repair expenses, not least because of their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the waste water plant Azendorf due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pump plant, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be dredged out, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation option installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses included the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which have to be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous calculation in 2011/2012 were still significantly below the current level.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the low waste water generation in the three plants, the costs for the operation and maintenance are "full".
Schmidt added that the market community has been spared large maintenance costs for wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the above-mentioned plants would remain precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water treatment association could not be extended to include these plants because they were in deficit.
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest figure (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% after the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase was observed compared to the previous month for the following categories of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
As in the previous month, prices remained unchanged for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to races.
With its filter tool Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders on absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, feature twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps are made public.
Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in the past, accusing them of promoting Blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it proposed to some users this week a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellow face".
They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a major problem that the company had with diversity.
The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon by Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced Rassissmus, the filter reminded of vile clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely spread, wrote that the filter "was hurting and to say the least unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-eyed, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the derogatory extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stumbling wires.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could rather assume to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "so it's much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it used to be," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, asking others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed that race-related controversy reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the largely white, male-only leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It either has no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in its workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a human resources manager who focused on under-represented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said that she would leave her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it's not OK."
Military leadership falsified ISIS intelligence information, noted Congressional committee
Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence in order to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a Congressional committee of inquiry reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, or Cencom for short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Message service information typically nodded by high-ranking Centcom commanders regularly gave a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground had allowed, and were consistently more positive than analyses by other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that Obama’s leaders have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have been exposed to pressure from their precepts to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, Kansas Republican Congressman, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command leaders changed intelligence reports to minimize ISIS's threat in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after they were told that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings during the investigation.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence are underway.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively limited process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," said the highest-ranking Democrat in the Committee, member of the Adam B. Schiff House of Representatives.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged the morale among analysts and "provided excessively little room for dissent."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that they did not find any evidence of White House intervention with the Centcom analysts on "certain political opinion."
The preliminary results of the Congress' investigation were published by The Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's Inspector General, which were initiated after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesman, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on Congress reports while the Inspector General's investigation was still underway.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).
However, last year's accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism about the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of conflicts of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, the then government under George W. Bush provided only a small occupation force in Iraq and spent little time worrying about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, according to government figures, Mr. Hooker's team noted that, contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The USA wins fourth match in the women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK ahead
The day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a Thursday match against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember ever having done that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who keeps their gates in mind.
But she knows that: The American women are in the Olympic competition at 4-0 and are in the first place in their group with the British women, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two will win first and second place within their group of six teams.
The first placed will avoid the strong Dutch women who lead the other group a little longer.
Whatever the outcome of the game on Saturday, the American women's success story has sparked a surprising vortex, four years after they landed in the last of 12 places at the last London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey bat in her hands for the first time at the age of three (their two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), when she was 16 she became a US national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008, as she could not qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team, and with that things began to turn for better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We were able to pull the rudder completely around.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backlash from the near area.
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She made a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and blew the ball into the goal to give the American women a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to score one goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
Amidst the rag of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a raging relay run between competition and striving.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick that is passed from crossbow shooter to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is in the Olympic Games for the first time and a flock of women with dimples, could have been among these well-known names that are being broadcast to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV ads, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline gym.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event in the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the chest swim and may it reign for a long time.
But if modestly I could make arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it debuted in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived for the last 16 years that many of the people I asked did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampoline jumping has a certain outside charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I'm not an expert, but just an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoon-like shaking of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially unites.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means "jumpboard."
Ascending winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have to make a series of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are rated according to execution, difficulty level and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medal hopes must continue in their quest for gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also another scornful goal in television broadcasting: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I feel as a bit tiring when watching these games.
The trampoline offers a respite.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
Forward movement is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here too there is competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no vaults into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
The women's qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympic Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the aggression and objectification of male athletes - as proposed by the US male gymnasts recently according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his air-breathing, new fan community.
"One generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses testify that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police during gunfire.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
In the last ten years, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months protests against the government have shaken the country and have spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's response was merciless.
Witnesses claimed that police officers shot and killed ten unarmed demonstrators.
Videos circulating about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continually led the government's repression - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and they have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
All the youth protested.
A generation protested.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the Eritrean border; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and arm themselves again.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of simmering under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones became more common and Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethopia's predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But that too is changing.
"We are coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death from an unpublished illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly savvy at seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to work on opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he doesn't enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, were apparently botched by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in recent months, and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal displeasure of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked businesses run by Tigray, and hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests put the US and other Western allies in a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights across neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin ridge hike."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS had been "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, stating that his repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group was not serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the presidential candidate's communication skills as to whether he was able to communicate with the American public in a clear and understandable way.
It also brings his associates, who strive to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant at all.
After making the hint at an election campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump rowed back to the statement on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely serious.
When conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism beats Mr. Trump as he tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.
Speaking on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he received strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course I meant that sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods of testing how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clarifying" depending on how the reaction is done." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone, as his polls have declined further.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a lead with a big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly focused on attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal fellow fighters into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand with him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbenchers, completely wrong, and that is why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to the campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for presidentship.
Once displaced from the market by the price, Café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay in cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue storefront.
Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, excluding Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a soap store."
But if New York is change, then it's reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee's still good, too.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café who owns and manages the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered to provide funds for a new branch, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb used the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, once lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited the verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she'd be on her way.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized it was the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended chai tea that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably ordered the same thing.
"I came after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch, and they're making my Everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't have a grudge about the soap store taking over the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold-breathed coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're going to go into her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice bar wants to bottle and sell the cold brewed coffee.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighbouring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was devastated when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a fondness for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the US, while Ziegelman tells about living in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective in her book "97 Orchard".
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will be published on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, unscrupulous snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mix.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple found it appropriate for a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Reich-containing foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have been lying in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an all-you-can-eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country was dealing with being no longer the Schlaraffenland.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: Mysterious foods such as breads and casserole rolls became staple foods, the casserole roll as a "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers," noted Ziegelman, as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the center of American cuisine for many years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried out, as a high - calorie and nourishing satisfaction took precedence over taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at noon," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions don't match each other.
It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.
As never before or ever since, domestic economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - drove the country’s eating habits in such a way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "domestic politicians" and to meet the challenge of turning pancakes like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical treats.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-mich-kuchen-Essen attitude, are tasty.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the millionaire man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was wonderfully unreal.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to make an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in Mrs. Roosevelt's flavors led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most bleakly prepared."
Many of the ways of dealing with food from the Great Depression era were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple stated that they understood Ziegelman's mother-in-law's eating habits better - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the dishes at Eisenberg's had been cleared, they and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plume dessert that President Roosevelt ate at lunchtime.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a chic name.
There was no whipped cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each reluctantly plunged a spoon into the tough, brown glibber.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a refill three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he said to his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old has died even in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that, according to Bild-Zeitung, has saved the lives of almost 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civilian protector showing him in an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the ruins of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol figure in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, said loudly, "For me, this is the real jihad."
"When I die saving lives, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he spoke in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffering from breathlessness.
"We now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate animal is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks don't grow up until they're 150 years old.
The Greenland shark swims leisurely along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 meters.
Only when it matters, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km/h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal.
However, this slow lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist had long suspected that Greenland sharks would become stone-old.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers know little about the life style of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow motion speed when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
These sharks still make prey: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, while another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and search for cadavers that go down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland sharks that caught fishermen from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitsbergen.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest was 502 centimeters long.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens core of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is created even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960 ’ s, when nuclear tests hurled larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimetres, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear tests, so it probably celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.
All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens core, which is caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark, while the record shark with 502 centimeters should be even 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably at the threshold of sexual maturity and its age at 156 years was determined, Greenland sharks obviously take at least one and a half centuries to multiply.
This, too, is likely to be a world record for vertebrates at the moment.
It is no coincidence that such methusalms live mainly in icy waters.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale with a 120-year-old harpoon tip on its neck, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame of austerity.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with one gram of elephant.
Another advantage is that you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Building land in double pack
In the recent meeting, the municipal council focused on issues relating to building.
With relief, the panel welcomed the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can finally begin".
After the real estate, parcelling and development issues could be clarified and the applications for surveying could be submitted, the sale of the real estate in the residential development areas "Strasslweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße area - expansion section 1) to interested parties is no longer in the way.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal equally to young families and upscale seniors.
As it was said, construction workers can now report to the town hall, and the municipal council is expected to discuss the allocation of the plots in its September meeting.
In order to be able to respond to requests for the establishment of further commercial enterprises, together with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the land use plan in sub-areas, which was only created in the spring of this year.
In the area of Unterzeitlarn, the already designated industrial area is expanded by two parcels in the direction of Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The City of Main therefore has the best chances of attracting jobs and firms relocated from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's financial markets and real estate markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London through financial transactions throughout the EU.
The so-called EU passport has so far been approved in Great Britain.
That's what big U.S. banks are using right now.
Several banks have already announced moving jobs.
The lobbying association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which unites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority (EIOPA) and the Risk Board (ESRB).
Although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with supervision," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, but, like Dublin, it is less efficient in terms of infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city has easily available commercial properties.
"It's not that easy to find free high-quality offices in Paris," says Voigtländer.
At the Seine, the rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of the management consultancy Mercer, the city ranks seventh, Luxembourg ranked 19th, Dublin ranked 33rd and Paris ranked 37th.
Even if quality of life is a matter of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," concludes the IW.
However, despite Brexit vote, London will remain Europe's most important financial centre, according to economists.
This is also reflected in the balance of power: according to figures from Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, while in Frankfurt there were 62,500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by it in the Hepatits C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from a $200 million compensation payment for the violation of two Merck patents related to the Blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge exposed a pattern of misbehavior on the part of Merck, including perjury and other unethical acts.
When the lawsuit was brought on Thursday, U.S. Attorney Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to waive the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to match Gilead, who dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work that was underpinned by Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
US-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left it, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (DKS) are combing through the city following the departure of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish informed Manbij Military Council Reuters, allied with the DKS.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are doing clean-up work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2% for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly USD 5.3 million in speech honors; the former Secretary of State stated an income of USD 3 million from the Simon & Schuster publishing house for her book on her term in the State Department.
Clinton's candidate for the vice president, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, published his tax returns for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Holton.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in a statement.
In a stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdrawals regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns even though they are not legally obliged to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his attorneys have stated that he has a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
"You're on the move," Clinton's campaign helper Ian Sams wrote on Twitter regarding the release of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special advisor, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits were completed.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations to charities, his business practices, and various other connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already thrown himself on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republican Trump calls for his tax return to be published.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on economics in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns," she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors on Friday saying that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called for Trump to meet to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subject to an IRS tax audit and Trump had "fear" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clinton tax return of 2015 showed that they only received USD 100 of their income as a wage, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clinton's dividends and income taxed at USD 109,000.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox species to prevent elephants from going to people-inhabited settlements - throwing condoms on them filled with chili powder.
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, together with the US Nature Conservation, has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without hurting animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we've developed the Toolkit, we've been able to see a change of attitude within these communities, and they're much more confident that they can keep elephants from their fields without harming the elephant," said Honeyguide's CEO Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust on chilli powder into the air.
A touch quite usually already out to chase the elephant away.
A last possibility is a thrower who shoots a golden rainfirework into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City council unanimously decides: No new kiosk on the St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, the St. Goar companies accept investment projects by traders with a kiss hand - since the retail trade in the core city is considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the city council unanimously rejected the request for a new sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli code was removed after "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media riot after he had revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli code, as Arab guests had "called for it" according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", left out his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country pre-election list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel via its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was an "intentional decision of the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind it caused even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the code be deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and dismayed by this event.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is an even greater shame.
There's no need to explain that.
We expect the hotel to draw "the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident sparked a pretty big response on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Some assumed to the Kempinski Hotel that it "had given in" to the alleged demands of Arab guests.
"Be ashamed," said another article, which pointed out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations and called the incident an "incident" and "apologies" to Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction not to include Israel in the fast-track voting list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo, Brazil, when they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw graffiti spraying on walls against provisional president Michel Temer.
The recent protests took place a few days after mass protesters took to the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been dismissed from office by a Senate vote.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies have shown a strong interest in business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are establishing existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent, reaching $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million.
The trade upturn was achieved by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian embassy issued some 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are being broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses Wanted: Drink Market in Waldbröl Attacked
A robbery was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL at Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Under the condition of a gun, three darkly dressed persons, who had mumbled their faces, demanded cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
How much money was captured, the police do not tell.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market and poorly visible.
The perpetrators must have run after the raid towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking garage with the silver-coloured car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time of the crime (at 7:45 p.m.) relating to the robbery should urgently report to the police.
Nagold: Play and fun at summer time
The children and young people of the social education day group/social group work of the children's protection association Nagold spent eight beautiful and happy days with their caregivers on their summer holiday in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet holiday home Hardtwäldle the lively group was accommodated during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the agenda.
On the one hand we went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's tour in the world famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited for jumping, swimming and splashing.
Culinaryly, children and caregivers were spoiled with their self-prepared personal dishes such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewels were created from pearls and stones, or a Roman mill game was made of wood.
Other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, evenings by fire and the final "Bunte Abend".
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home contentedly.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Door of Mercy
The ministrators from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage to Rome of all the ministrators in two years, the Oberministrantenrunde St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the final decision was made for the bishop city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the gate of mercy opened for this purpose at the Freiburg Cathedral.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set out.
The evening before, Father Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and gave the pilgrim blessing.
From Horb there was a train ride to the starting point Villingen, where there is also a Münster of Our Lady and so the pilgrimage from the Münster was started.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches kept stopping again and again to sing together a song from specially compiled pilgrim song booklet.
For the overnight stays, parish homes were available to the local parishes.
At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, had to be climbed first about 500 meters in the hot weather and then climbed again.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage in Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived in the late afternoon at the Freiburger Münster and crossed the gate of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening mass in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were greeted by the cooperator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scots Callum Skinner storms home when British wins gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men's sprint at Velodrom in Rio when the British team defended the title of London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. Jungspund made the legend proud when he stormed home to take home a victory from New Zealand’s favorites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place at the World Championships in London in March, despite Hoys' resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did so in time when Hindes showed up.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was barely back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy was a major part of the transformation, in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow it down and enable Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed onto the podium.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the triumph of 2012 at Kenny's and Hoy's side, Hindes admitted that after a weak start, he deliberately fell on the track.
He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags on the grandstand."
We've been together as a team for the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which has won seven out of ten titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.
With the form Kennys it is possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
For Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - this would mean a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be Hoy's.
Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will go for over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
It was the only medal contest of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.
They arrived at the finish line in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, in which Wiggins will certainly be the focus.
He had been arguing with agents before the qualification yesterday when officials called him to measure his height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie achieved world record time in 4:13,260 in the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and finish tomorrow.
The GB team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to attract a flock of medals.
After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were lowered.
Dramas took place in the background, such as the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of sexism and bullying accusations as well as the retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
The future of the Portland smelter due to the cancellation of the Energy Treaty
The future of Portland's aluminium melt in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to the operation of the plant.
A subsidy fixed for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - both direct and indirect - could be threatened by closure.
In addition, domino effects could occur, as the smelter consumes around 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa smelter in Portland is losing money and risking closure.
This step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it would assume that three other owners would terminate their contracts.
The plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means a further physical demand for electricity from the smelter," the company informed.
AGL also stated that the contracts were so-called "securing transactions", which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"From this point of view, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on revenues on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong forward markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual closing of $ 187 million in "anticipated termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts did not affect the "ability of Alcoa to operate the smelter or to ensure the power supply to the smelter."
The U.S. company said that it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even though it still owes a statement as to why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn against the possible closure of the Portland smelting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
Referring to analysts' statements earlier this week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
If both installations were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
And it wouldn't be good for us as a power generator," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder, who ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," wrote Kendall.
The cover was revealed by a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?) scripted reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the Rob and Caitlyn problem cases as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgets her sister's cover and ends with a classic twist: they all planned a surprise party.
This depicts the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we'd forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a radio station at 8 a.m.), but Kris somehow had to let her other girls participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her for the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league in itself.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a size that resembles a picture book rather than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 pages of advertising were from the 832 pages of the Wälzer).
The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly expected that in the last two years pictures of the magazine leaked even before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "famous models" than "models that are famous" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even with the small chance that Mrs Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people, or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't appeal to everyone.
Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense with her reality TV story.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model criticized Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called her "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on the displeasure seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
In the truest sense of the word, she is a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising your primer from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells her photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, she's on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her kids.
Municipal law centres disapprove of 160,000 people per year
More than 160,000 of the country's most needy are rejected annually by the municipal law centres, while the industry is focused on the impact of further cuts in funding on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, workers in need of help, victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust delogation and the like - are already denied access to free legal advice and legal assistance.
Community legal services, which are already over-exploited, are ready for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of the community centres of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without the Federal Government's decision being lifted.
"Queensland's community law centers are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are rejected from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this upsurge shows that they cannot get the help they need.
From June 2017, the Federal Government will cut funds by 30 percent, which means that thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and Federal Justice Minister as well as Senators of Queensland George Brandis to immediately lift these cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of municipal law centres and their client communities, and that the Palaszczuk government invests in this important work.
Donald Trump's election campaign accused after employees allegedly pulled weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was accused of alleged inaction after being told that her campaign leader for North Carolina had targeted a gun on an employee in February while they were on a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in the Charlotte District Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini stated that he had waited months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, " drew a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the run into Vincent's knee throat," Bordini stated in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign leaders, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to do damage," Bordini stated.
The prosecution comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the Second Amendment people - gun owners and gun lovers - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and judges appointed.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini's complaint demands damages from the campaign for breach of due diligence and Philip for assault and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press spokesperson Hope Hicks was unable to reach a statement.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign employee.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, were not responded to.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has conducted a controversial campaign so far.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey ahead of country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) significant losses for the governing parties SPD and CDU are emerging.
This resulted in representative surveys by the INSA opinion research institute for the "Image" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could rule just further, this is not possible according to the polls in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have good chances of continuing to place the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the poll, the party would thus only be close to the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Landtag.
Despite slight losses, the Greens are moving back to the Schweriner Landtag with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.
According to the survey, the SPD would only be 23 percent in the election of MPs in Berlin (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4%.
It would thus still be behind the Greens at 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left at 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented for the first time in the House of Representatives at 14 percent.
At 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, whereas the pirates would miss the move in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in memory initially amounted to eight megabytes, which would suffice today for about two selfies with high resolution.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into business exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow originate from the Stone Age of the Internet Age.
20 years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as a "office in the pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could reach a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator.
Even the access to websites was possible via HTML browser, although agonizingly slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be opened like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 DM, about 1400 euros.
The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could guess in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Things have changed since then.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The mobile phone business of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold and handled to Microsoft.
Today, suppliers dominate the market, all of which came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere online, this is everyday life for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, of which 555 million were sold by Samsung and Apple alone.
The worldwide turnover with the devices is around 400 billion euros.
In addition, there are the well-running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone at Mac-World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all easy to use via touch screen.
Apple's triumph began, and even today the iPhone is the company's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola, and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had a look.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung are now in charge of this.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
Today, on average, every German looks at his cell phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for personnel in the Siemens Board of Management.
Permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was Heathrow's biggest attraction, just as it was back in London in 2012, when we worked hard to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrow's enlargement is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in growth and to leave behind a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, to the T2 built in the middle of the world's two most frequented catwalks.
Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time we steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
According to one of the software manufacturers, for companies that make money with online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad blocking are equivalent to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus posted a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding of its advertisements in order to make it difficult to detect ad blockings as to which part of the advertising page is.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock's spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-back fight between the ad-blocking open source community and the surrounding community has been going on since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has become involved in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying indicators have become for the industry.
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker reported.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large proportion of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worthwhile investing in such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preferences tool" to give people more control over advertising targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we are planning to address the problem," said a Facebook spokesman in an e-mail message.
Ad blockers are a blunt remedy, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Run over woman in case of suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call on witnesses after a woman was hit on a highway in the early hours of the morning on Thursday in a suspected suicide of several vehicles.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was run over by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on site.
Several drivers have already been interrogated, but some have still not been identified, said the police, who called on them and every witness of the incident to report.
Gilles Hofstetter informed the Le Tribune de Geneve that an investigation was initiated, which is a "logical" step in such a situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be reported.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.
In each of the two cases - where one person was running on the highway in the dark - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent killing after she ran over and killed a man who was on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and passed out on the street, heard the court.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfectly extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has any further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-density atmosphere, could once have had earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus might have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly continued to rotate.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent more dull.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its daily side of the Sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than those of the earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus similar to evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was probably once habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained -- the Venus we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as the Colorado Avalanche's coach and vice president of hockey operations on Thursday and led the team's decision-making process with too little participation.
Alternate president/general manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
I've been thinking a lot and a lot over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly tailored to that of the organization.
It must also have the right to participate in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was named the best coach of the league at the 2013–14 Avalanches as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards during his debut season.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and dropped five points behind the Wild for a second Wildcard spot in the Western Conference.
As a Hall of Fame goalie, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strikes
Labour disputes regarding remuneration for North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group, as well as the Unite and RMT trade unions, can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will start early next year to address the problems anew.
The unions said that their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group reduced its rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate cut follows a 10% decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it rationalizes its operations as a result of its mega-merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation which had been exacerbated by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of about $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the cluster of Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates under the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars rotate at different rates in the star cluster, as well as the correlation between rotational periods and the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters of stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster of stars that emerged some 125 million years ago are now reaching adulthood.
They're turning the fastest way now.
At peak rotation rates, these ripening stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotational rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots --.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the cluster of stars is so close to the Pleiades, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The cluster of stars of the Pleiades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still a lot ahead of us about what we would like to learn more about how the how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their "dance shoes", so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees one last time against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12th.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14-time all-star game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was named the most valuable player in the league three times, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has earned him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player it paid Rodriguez back with performance for a long time.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he has made several milestones.
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar scores in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the fame hall of baseball.
Because as successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
As early as 2009, the superstar at "ESPN" admitted to having taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was banned for 211 games due to involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is regarded as the main suspect of having received performance-promoting remedies for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a dispute, the lock was reduced to 162 matches.
"The league could even have done me a favor for 2014, because I played through 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said at the time suffocatingly.
His farewell days are not silent either.
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi etched.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and is said to have relationships with pop star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, got sympathy expressions from the fans of the Yankee Erzrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the supporters sang in the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympics 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Observed: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping events.
A caught athlete almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping events became known at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle skater Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - just before the start of the already critically eyed athletics competitions, these news come at an untimely time.
The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances, had already been detected in Chen last Sunday.
On Friday afternoon, the International Court of Sport CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the 50 m freestyle preliminaries.
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B sample and for a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations," Xinhua quoted from a statement: "We will work with the International Court of Justice of Sport CAS and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio the news leaked about the positive rehearsal at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she told Bulgarian TV channel BNT, "this is an incredible shock.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," said the athlete.
According to the report, the banned substance is meant to be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was suspended for the time being, according to BNT the B-sample was already positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borisov spoke immediately with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-loaded nation may not participate in Rio.
On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" became known, the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tomasz three days earlier positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both contest the ingestion, but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletics, the Danekowa case is one more serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport.
The IAAF had banned the start of the entire Russian team, except for one exception because of systematic doping, and the Kenyan running nation also produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming sports, the previous crimes in China had also caused violent clashes between the athletes.
Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pees purple."
"When I see the 200 m freestyle podium, I want to vomit," Lacourt said on the French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of an engagement with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping deceivers," he said.
Sun had been tested positively for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to sit a three-month lockdown.
Data stealing: So perfide hackers extort their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists, malware bytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once in the past 12 months, sometimes multiple victims of an attack using blackmailer software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already the target of ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
According to the observations of malware bytes, the perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks in corporate networks.
If they succeed there, the ransom that could be extorted will be significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing a frighteningly fast evolution of malware," explains malware byte boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks has been alarmingly fast in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it searches specifically for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims have to transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is stopped.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt their business activities, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in the company.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, the security researchers at F-Secure investigated the user interfaces and the contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos explains: "A single person can write a ransomware about within a week."
However, it is more likely that there are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-off, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"The scope of delivery includes an customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then look for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then commission spammers to spread," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better back up their data.
Over 50 percent of the corporate IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to fend off ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful ejection, the perpetrators threaten instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, depending on the type of data, the damage potential is many times higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on completely new goals in the Internet of Things.
At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom to some victims.
If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One in all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V looks rather small, the passengers have plenty of space in the front row as well as in the rear, it does not seem narrow at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and seem pleasant, only the cockpit upper side falls off.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of storage space.
There is not only a trunk of 453 l for raised and 1026 l for folded backrests available, but there is also the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The seat surfaces of the back seat can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height at 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he may do his work a little quieter.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasant.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-litre gasoline engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
A four-wheel drive is not offered.
Driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top version "Executive".
One of the safety systems is the City Emergency Brake Assist (worked up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the Track Stop Assist.
The collision detector sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when shunting.
The main beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed control reacts to traffic sign recognition and, if necessary, slows down speed.
However, full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI sockets lie under the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome to achieve.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emission standard.
With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued that liability is conceivable only in the case of risks typical of air transport (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any damages.
Sickness case: When does the organiser pay
After their trip, sick holidaymakers only get money back if the cause of the illness is beyond doubt in the hotel.
But this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have been shown to show the same symptoms.
In the case under negotiation, a family was seriously ill with diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their vacation to Turkey.
She spent almost the entire vacation in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage treatment plant, which allegedly had polluted the sea water.
The family felt that the trip was defective - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the plaintiffs did not succeed.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
However, the organiser only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
Until then, he had to assume that the sea water was fine.
He therefore did not violate his information obligations, according to the verdict.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion - is part of the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state had to react calmly and decisively at the same time to terrorist threats.
It is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists.
However, if criminals had to leave the country more quickly, this would increase security and also increase popular support for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the Bundestag election 2017.
He also announced a further strengthening of the security forces, "on a medium four-digit scale over several years".
Sympathy promotion for terrorism must be punishable again.
The aim is to improve video surveillance and to amend the law on arms so as to make it more difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
According to de Maizière's words, the last much-discussed duty of secrecy for doctors is to be respected.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wanted to find solutions to reduce the risk to citizens, he said with regard to mental abnormalities.
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people.
In order to persecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use covert investigators.
SPD leader Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It was important that the Minister of the Interior had spoken out clearly against actionism.
"This was a slap in the face for the sharpers in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a ban on Burka and the abolition of dual nationality.
He considered that a general ban on full veiling was problematic under constitutional law.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burqa.
One could talk about rules in the street or for witnesses in court.
Green leader Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate the power and ability to act with ever new anti-terror packages.
Left Party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet of sayings and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring the people in this country any more security".
Better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
It is regularly stuck on the bypass - here a picture of November.
But that is to change: the right-hand lane is to be extended.
This is good news for all drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding road every evening when driving via the motorway (A 43).
The Landesbetrieb Straßenbau will extend the right-hand lane by 700 metres next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and Weseler Straße.
Drivers can then thread directly from Hammer Straße to the right.
The big advantage: the traffic splits up more early, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representation Münster-West.
The narrowing of the roadway on the feeder irritates the motorists especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.
On weekdays, the backlog reaches to the bridge over Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle eye on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here the traffic is directed only one-lane over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be dismantled a good three-quarters of years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to accommodate heavy goods traffic in two lanes.
How long this bottleneck and the associated working day traffic jam will last cannot be said by the competent national organisation.
However, years can be expected: because the bridge has an official residual useful life until the year 2034.
For the extension of the right-hand lane, the state company deliberately chose the less traffic-friendly time during school holidays, because there are problems to be expected.
The traffic will pass the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday in one lane.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Activities for Schools
The international class of the Waldschule attended the play "The Invisible House".
The Nima's Association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima's association enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has attended a performance of the award-winning play "Das Invisiblee Haus" of the Junge Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the Nima Association, 19 students between eleven and 15 years of age visited the production in the Kleine Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Between September 2015 and March 2016, most young people in the class came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among others, and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Junge Theater Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without an escape and migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language teaching are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes that want to participate.
Rain instead of shooting stars: hope for weather improvement
The weather in the south-west of Germany made a dash through the bill on Friday night - but there is still hope.
The night was bad for observing the sky spectacle because of clouds and rain, said Hans-Ulrich Keller, chairman of the observatory Welzheim, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we will see many shooting stars in the sky.
The star scales are perseids, which are one of the fastest shooting stars at 216000 kilometres per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful Night: Tips against Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleep even far before the alarm ringing.
It's anything but relaxing.
After all, people are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent often or permanently feel that their sleep is not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders and they can be based on a variety of causes, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
But what is commonly understood by this is the insomnia, that is, a sleep disturbance.
Many people feel that sleeping through it is particularly unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Association of Family Physicians with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medications.
Not infrequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
"Very early waking up is common, especially in depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors are interdependent.
For example, if you have a herniated disc, you may fall ill, wake up every two to three hours, and you may start pondering about everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to a doctor with trouble sleeping?
For those who do not sleep well for at least three nights a week over a period of one month and are affected by the day, weeß advises that they go to the doctor.
The impairment can look quite different: one is tired, tired, unsleeping, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.
In order to relieve the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are hardly any nursing patients in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Weeß advises that in case of sleeping problems, first contact the family doctor.
He can check whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what's happening?
For example, doctors recommend testing in the sleep laboratory for snoring with breath cancelers, pathological tiredness of the day, sleepwalkers, or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, explains Fietze.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just please don't make a nap," says Fietze.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
Next to the electrodes on the body you wear a nose goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can people get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can put on for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: regular sleeping and getting up, not lying in bed too long, not sleeping in the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is absolutely not beneficial.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler commented on the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis via Facebook.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the World Ski Championships in Doha and set his first world record at the same time.
Now former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has stood up via Facebook to his critical ex-team colleagues.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € premium and a jungle king 150,000 € should no one wonder about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old on Friday night on his Facebook page.
The support system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
This does not allow us to compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the subject of doping or even operate it.
"I am not saying that controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That's exactly how it should be done with countries.
"Those who cannot be controlled by independent controllers of WADA/FINA for a certain time before the WM/OS cannot participate," demanded the election Hamburger, who now runs an ice cream parlor.
Airport: gang of luggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
Civil investigators of the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had committed several pocket and luggage thefts as gangs.
At around 9.30 p.m., civil officers in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to police officers from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July this year, and they had done so jointly, on a part-time basis and particularly professionally.
The specialists of the Crime Commission 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had come to Germany specifically to commit crimes.
They had taken over 15,000 euros in total.
Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between a rest of cobblestones: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't seem like this at first glance, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a organic store.
Someone sprayed "ugly" on the façade of a grey house.
Opposite a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already being built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.
Articles about this "trendy district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are, however, preferably illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor still rooms are occupied and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, Berlin's interior senator Henkel in particular had repeatedly called for a hard action by the police against the project, the area as a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers on June 22, police patrolled for three weeks according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, blocked parts of the street and prevented visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the evacuation had been illegal, and one day later police and construction workers departed under the cheer of sympathizers and residents.
This summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk before the Späti.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence.
They share the concerns about rising rents and gentrification with the residents of the house projects.
It doesn't sound like a neighbourhood that mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing leftists.
The trench opened by the Berlin interior senator and the police between squatters and their neighbors apparently does not exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class quarter, which has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupation and the housing projects born from it have also long been part of the neighbourhood: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße very close to the Rigas.
While the Mainzers had been cleared under a large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are partly still inhabited today by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and election berliners from all over the world in recent years: residents from the GDR and former squatters now share their neighbourhoods with them.
This is also reflected in the rents that have increased by almost 60 percent in new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga area are attacked as symbols of this development: they can be seen from thrown-in windows or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.
No other street was mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-wing autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbours regard this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: According to statistics, crimes such as assault are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the crimes involve damage to property, which tends to hit new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived for 17 years in a tenement house next to the controversial 94, there can be no question of uncertainty.
When it comes to violence, she is appeased: The people in the 94 are their neighbors, they certainly were not.
Even the famous burning cars have not been in Riga for a long time.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere".
Neugebauer has deliberately moved to Rigaer Straße - and stayed.
That's why it was so important to her that the residents get their streets back: from the police, politics and the media, all of whom suddenly claimed the power of interpretation over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road is still taken away from them: faceless new buildings in former building blocks that displace the old residents.
"In the end, these are condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - people live here rather, who are not so well deceived," she says.
"Violence and destruction I absolutely cannot approve."
But what do you do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including with the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are attracted to paint bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the neighbourhood.
Those who move here should be aware of this - just like those who move to a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organiser.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social pedagogue supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a point of contact for all actors: refugees, refugee aid working group, administration, authorities and who else is involved.
Regine Kunde from the working group suggests that volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-legend wool-milk-sau, which has a problem above all.
For example, some - less mockingly than rather aiming at the large number of desired areas of activity - had meant when the administration wanted to write out the position.
An administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, was sought, namely an egg-legending woolly milk sow.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organisation, working with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been with us for about six weeks.
It has a 50 per cent post limited to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, "that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.
Soon new containers will be in the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time now to find housing for the connecting refugees who have been recognised.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living spaces.
The costs of the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
Responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to the municipality and Jobcenter.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find any private dwellings.
It does not work so far, so one depends on private apartments, says Deuschle.
Therefore, community housing needs to be upgraded, as they say.
So new containers will soon be installed in Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent residence, these are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and temporary jobs for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up.
"More seats would be good," says Regine Kunde.
Many work in the building yard or help janitors, do non-profit work - and this is motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive visibility.
This is "no occupational therapy".
But activity does not mean just work.
The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So, here too, the administration and volunteers are jumping in.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures was a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and that they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach must not work and is useless, he will never integrate.
The clear majority was motivated.
But there are also problem cases, says customer honestly, "people with nothing at all". Therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always also to motivate others.
It's all a mammoth task.
A difficult question: are they afraid of radicalisation after the recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde quite clearly, "what some may call naive." However, a residual risk cannot and does not exclude it.
But the helpers are already sensitive.
These incidents were also the subject of refugees.
They'd be afraid that the assassins would completely discredit them.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with this," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So the main and volunteers have to look for activities on the spot and in the region.
They always have in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
Politics is afraid to answer this question clearly.
Actually, it's not fair to put them on the ground.
"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Kunden also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy integrating the previous people in a reasonable way.
These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Intruder with helicopter wanted
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men entered a flat in an apartment in an apartment house in Lindenweg at 8:50 a.m. on Friday morning.
The resident surprised the two and ran away from the filth.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both wearing blue jeans and black hooded sweaters.
They fled downtown.
The police used several patrol crews as well as a police helicopter for the search.
The search went without success.
Perhaps the unknown were noticed before the action near the apartment or when they fled.
