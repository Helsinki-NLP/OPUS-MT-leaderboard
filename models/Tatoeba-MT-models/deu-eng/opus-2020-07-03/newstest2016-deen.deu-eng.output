Obama Receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticises Israel's ongoing settlement building and accuses Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
The deal for the Iranian nuclear program promoted by Obama has further worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech before the U.S. Congress, some of which was considered an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, who had refused a meeting with reference to the upcoming election in Israel.
In a distress call, Professor confesses to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This was stated by the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no evidence that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds, where, according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police surrounded him.
One day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and lecturers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, with 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies towards problematic behavior.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm had told him that he was dealing with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying that he had some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the doctorate, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic way to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
These are questions Lamb can't answer anymore.
After escaping campus, the police later found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met by mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing for a few years.
He was the women's swarm back then.
All the girls melted away when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and residing in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no record of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared at a summer fair three years ago.
Later, they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a poorly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night for the last time in the night of September 5th, after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking together.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first-semester seminar program and specialized in Native Americans and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee.
On the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community, attended a candlelight memorial ceremony on Tuesday evening.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency call called Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many Christmas season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it was planning to recruit 40,000 people in shops and sales centers throughout the country. 45,000 people were still employed during the Christmas season 2014.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that it will start this month with job interviews and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays are even months away, the Christmas business is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated yawn and an arm's length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "uncontroversially the biggest time travel movie ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the almost five years of conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chief once again calls on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - in the margins of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation unsolvable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing the Syrian crisis that they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 polls showing that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to label him as a flop.
Others have dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks in polls down, it hasn't (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in double-digit range, and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomination of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the parliamentary term.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to Herman Cain at that time in 2011, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsiders such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's perseverance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some recent survey results suggesting that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University survey showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul as positive.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a poll conducted by CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they're upset if he's the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next one on enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be "unsatisfied" or "annoyed" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, became the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish Republican voters believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure applies in the first nation's primary state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to carry out his office effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they put on their scholars' hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, after a CNN/ORC survey last week, four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that time in the last cycle four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, a large number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused across more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University survey at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps the majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say that they have formed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have firmly forgiven their votes.
Of course, much can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change their mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their minds are twice as frequent for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been the focal point of public discourse on 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic expression will keep crucial Hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation efforts.
But according to the new ABC/Post survey on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump seems to be doing the same.
The frustration about the government is rising to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now have about half the support of Republican voters, mainly due to their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey of ABC/Post that they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're angry at Washington, too.
A poll by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa republicans are frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "hellly annoyed".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea.
In the street one square meter of a roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"The supply of objects is naturally limited to Sylt," says the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which particular locations one square meter costs most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student booth in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top locations, however, the price is similar to Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in dizzying heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros nix - per square meter, mind you.
But good, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is not at the top here for once.
Champions League: Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double goal scorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller simply has a run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it went.
A confident prelude to the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the Hexenkessel of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götze's hit (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start success in series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third attempt.
In his 28th match in the Champions League, Müller was kindly assisted by Olympic goaltender Roberto, who let a shot of the world champion, intended as a flank, pass.
"We won't underestimate them," Bavaria captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the match at the Karaiskakis Stadium before 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without shining.
Piraeus had won his youngest six home games in the Royal League, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1:3) also stumbled here.
But the Bavarians, in seven European Cup matches with Greek teams undefeated, did not want to be the next victim.
They responded boldly, but often too uninventive in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by shifting the game to the left side of Douglas Costa, who rarely got through against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flank from the right half-field in the upper left toreck.
In the 67th minute, the world champion forgave the possible 2-0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunities in half one.
First, when Olympiakos stormer Ideye Brown struck the headball of Poland off the line (26.).
Then by direct acceptance, the goalkeeper Roberto parried with his knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians played their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to put pin stitches.
On goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was however dependable.
For example, when he directed a shot of Ideye over the latte (56.).
Before newer, Guardiola had a four-man chain with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, which did it well.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the cadre, first sat outside.
The World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training, said sports board member Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Who wants to make something else out of it, that is already malicious".
Guardiola also decided against him at the first change, when he brought Kingsley Coman for the beaten Lewandowski (59.).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and arranged everything 13 minutes later, Müller put another penalty on it.
Before the match, riots had occurred in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly masked Bavarian fans in their audience block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and took action against the Munich followers with batons.
At least one Bavarian fan was injured and transported from the stadium.
Smoking has a higher risk of losing teeth
Anyone who smokes does not only harm the lungs, but also the teeth - this is what a Potsdam long-term study suggests.
The good news is that if you don't give up, the risk drops quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is evident from the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Human Nutrition (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely by 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE emphasizes.
Smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It was not clarified to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
But people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take more than ten years for the threat to return to the level of non-smokers, explained first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
One had to convince people to become non-smokers, study director Heiner Boeing of DIfE explained: "Smoking shortens the lifetime."
Non-smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health up to old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE reported.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study underpins the findings.
Archaeologists meet remnants from the Late Antiquity on the banks of the Rhine in Cologne
Archaeological finds have been made again on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
In the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-Germanic-Museum excavated skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called ground monuments.
For all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always consulted as a specialist office for archaeological conservation.
In the third phase of the construction of the Rhine boulevard the archaeologists were found.
From text documents it was already known that there was a fortress in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, explained Trier.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman covered by freight train
After a young woman at the railway station in Geilenkirchen-Lidern has been killed, the federal police ask the population for help.
On early Wednesday morning at around 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the tracks from the station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mönchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, she suffered the most serious injuries by recording the train.
She was treated on the spot and taken to a hospital by rescue workers.
The investigators have no knowledge of the reason for the nightly crossing of the young woman's tracks.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leifferther Straße (L364) are eligible.
Information on the cause of the accident can be provided at the Federal Police hotline, which is open 24 hours a day, by calling 0800/6888000 or any other police department.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to defuse the dispute over the planned Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system which, in its functioning, corresponds to much more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said Cecilia Malmström, the EU Commissioner responsible, at the presentation.
The Swedes intend to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position into the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is intended to create the world's largest free trade area with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures provide for the EU and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court.
They are supposed to come in equal parts from the EU, the USA and third countries.
For the first time, a second instance is also planned.
It would allow us to object to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed among themselves on arbitrators, and there has been no possibility of appeal against their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months, Malmström commented that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice.
In the long term, according to her own data, she wants to work towards an International Investment Court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be resolved.
Investor-state arbitration (ISDS) is one of the main reasons for Europe's strong opposition to TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice through which companies can claim damages at the expense of taxpayers, break national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
Anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact identified the EU Commission's proposals as insufficient in their initial opinions.
The main criticism was that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, German Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as great progress.
The Commission took into account key points in the reform that Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel had drawn up with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European BusinessEurope Association warned that too many new rules would limit the opportunities for business to complain.
This could put particularly small and medium-sized enterprises at a disadvantage, it said.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) free trade agreement can be concluded remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been under way since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should be established by the end of this year.
This date shall be deemed no longer to be sustainable.
Delicate folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens is on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Steven's lecture.
He tells about various places he keeps drawing on the map, about which his meticulous and delicately arranged songs tell.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his home country.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
With the 2003 and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs appear, which harmoniously nestle very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
It is rumored that "Michigan" is the first part of a daring series: each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks certain expectations positively.
Reduces Stevens' appearance here.
Live is enough for him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the show.
"Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invitations You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") is a 2005 masterpiece celebrated throughout the world.
Excessive of ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album is included in the American Billboard Charts and is not missing in any of the year's best lists of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses very extensive electronic offsets on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth proper studio album is still widely orchestrated, but is carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and reverberation.
Long since the smaller clubs got out, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon stirrups and large fluorescent stage decoration.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark kept Hamburger More!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell", which has been available since March.
Although nearly 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs, Stevens, who has become much more mature, returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the broadly enriched album.
From the audience one hears: The lecture is "opulenter" and one can throw away the "record basically".
Only for an encore Stevens modestly thanks, plays acoustically few older songs and finally bows down with roaring applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited
The new Labour chairman Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and to get involved with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance probably being examined by the media and by the Labour MPs.
He demanded "less theater and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, as it will come after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour chairman's decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain provoked criticism of a number of Tory MPs and is at the centre of several front page stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he had "standing in respectful silence" and that he had recognized the Royal Air Force's "hero in the air battle for England".
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem "independently" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's top team, and they invoke differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stacking" within Labour, following Mr Corbyn's comments on the position on the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is making changes to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow labor and pension minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman to face David Cameron in the past decade over the dispatch box in Parliament, ever since he was Tory's boss.
The Labour chairman, who has promised a different policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that it will refrain from both "beating ability" and barbarism and instead has set out to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economics minister, will represent him if he does not participate - for example, if Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also talked about the idea that other colleagues occasionally took the floor, and that he had addressed John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "Kasperle Theatre", which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in it.
As it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics argued that it had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Shot in Joburg': homeless young people trained as photographers
Johannesburg city centre is a hard-hitting place when you're homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and earn a living with it.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds up by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound rose in leaps and bounds according to data indicating an increase in the UK's wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by the bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest since 2009 to provide estimates of the timing of an interest rate increase.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and climbed up to 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20 % jump after the acquisition of rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from Richemont, a competitor for luxury goods.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are reporting growth again.
Glencore shares increased by 5% after the mining giant said he had taken $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The Mondi Group's shares were the biggest losers on the index, with a decline of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had "selled" his assessment of the company's rating.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages are jeopardizing expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs at his company, he says.
The costs could hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and that could mean fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappic 21 years young, a chicken with an oberschicker frieze.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More like that.
Mr. Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is freaking out.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
It's all right.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock in the morning, however, the Polish sits on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: This is where your idol, whose posters are hanging together in Szczecin, has been living since Monday evening.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs exactly as much a day as her mother Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "Actually, my Wiktoria should be in tenth grade in high school."
"I'll make her dream come true."
Compulsory education?
Who cares?
The fans don't.
Not even Bieber himself.
He took care of it anyway.
For the advertising break of the Superbowl, he collected three million dollars, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company flushed many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter, Bieber also collects.
When Justin Bieber drinks coffee, you're amazed at the window pane.
He's said to have captured more than 100 million.
Some say the hype is going too far.
Others point out that Bieber is in first place in the USA and the UK with his new single "What do you mean?".
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros.
At least he's pretending.
Pegida Poster Brings Lebanese to Potato Done Idea
Potatoes or doners?
Both are possible - in the potato doner developed by the Oldenburg snack owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the phrase "potato instead of doner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a spit.
The idea was brought to him by a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Kartoffeln statt Döner", which he had accidentally seen on TV.
Since then, his shop has been turned into a barbeque skewer filled with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculty for the stomach," says Alhay.
The Libanese has now registered the idea with the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the Authority, it has recently been protected there as a utility model.
Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and potatoes the skewer contains.
Only so much: "It tastes even better together," he says.
The culinary international understanding is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches bottom-up campaign to combat Aldi invasion
Metcash tries to protect the IGA branch from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Grocery wholesalers Metcash has launched a bottom-up campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building up the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice cream manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and shop owners selling discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29th when the wholesaler of food, alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investor strategy day.
There is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the East.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorious provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after the opening of its first markets, Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two states and take away sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and achieve sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery business and in the quantities on Metcash's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash about $13 million profit before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan survey found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade. Metcash.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to the comments made by Mr Douglass.
But it's assumed that a board member of Metcash made contact with Mr Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent, and income from Metcash's food and food trade, which supplies approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction while simultaneously putting pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler resists and invests more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products each week, and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through fast-growing fresh food, and to deliver a better range of private label foods.
Metcash's Chief Executive, Ian Morrice, says that price adjustments and shop-renovation programs will increase to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is often referred to as "Special Ks", came into the spotlight with the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison exclaiming, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beat the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket after a spasm thwarted a potential US open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was defended by Healy steadfastly.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinals against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm quite jealous about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little involved in the dispute," said Healy.
He broke a thug when he lost to the US Open due to a spasm, but he's not the first player to break a thug out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too hard.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he is well in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term fixture."
"First, we want the team to be fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick made the climb very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think it's appropriate, and it's best for the team and it's best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes the border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared the state of emergency and sealed off the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained all those who tried to get into the country illegally. All with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man's country and Serbian officials reacted with indignation.
For an unknown time, the people who had fled from violence were stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted, "Open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police.
Some rejected food and water from protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister said it was "unacceptable" to send migrants back from Hungary while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came one day after the 28-nation bloc at a controversial meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy.
Ministers, however, agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the overwhelming Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that eventually, next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would accept a further 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not put its hopes in an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so that they could shut off roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and the point of entry into the European Union.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted, however, that most of the arrivals are economic refugees who are looking for a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force in Hungary at midnight, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-meter (13 feet) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also impose higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency," said Zoltan Kovac's reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to accept the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, state security advisor to Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are about to repair the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process human data and pressed a crowd to push into it.
About 20 were able to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton halved his lead over Bernie Sanders in national poll
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the democratic race for nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the primary elections (58 percent earlier), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (increase of 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of the Democratic voters in the primary elections.
More than five months before the start of the primary elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is clear on which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some profits.
Clinton holds a big lead among women and moderates, but these advances have diminished.
Their support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only down five points.
Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and she and Sanders are now on the same level.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in the liberals with a double-digit lead ahead of Sanders, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of the Democratic voters in the country's pre-elections say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she was nominated by the party.
A quarter of them would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support her only because she is the candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter of them would enthusiastically support it.
While 48 percent of the Democratic voters in the primaries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it's time for a Madam President to be (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to dealing with the problems and the selectability are also cited.
As the vice president throws a potential for the presidential office into the balance, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the primaries want to see him in the race - even though a third believes that he should not do it.
If democratic voters of the primaries are asked who would be their second election for the party, Biden is in the lead.
More than half of Clinton's followers say Biden's second election is far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, this figure of 78 percent fell last month.
Biden is by far the second in this measurement, but the percentage that regards it as the most "chosen" has risen.
Nevertheless, on the question of what is more important for a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about selectability.
Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to these voters of the primaries.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some important features among voters of their party’s pre-elections.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and endowed with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best placed to be honest with the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of democratic voters don't believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't think about him.
Democratic voters of the primaries generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
With all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and a server continue to be asked during her term as Secretary of State, most Democratic voters of the primaries are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it did not affect their views overall.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this issue was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on Clinton's general opinions, although 36 percent said that their opinion of her had worsened.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of voters do not think they are an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country also see Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good grades in leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson, and Bush score best in honesty.
A majority sees Sanders more as being honest, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson gets close to Donald Trump in a nationwide survey
Ben Carson is close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
The two candidates now account for half of the voter support in the new poll, and others are losing their grip dramatically.
Republican voters throughout the country continue to support Trump in large numbers. Support is growing by 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is well received by demographic groups and that Trump outperforms Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen most deeply, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week shows that Carson is increasing in polls - he is landing with 19% support from Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a carson rising last week, Trump found some side blows for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign performance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees.
Even if peak values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vacationers to find still warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people don't go into the sea anymore: The German Weather Service (DWD) reports that the water in the North and Baltic Seas has a maximum of 18 degrees this week.
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood burdened with the death of a Baruch College newcomer
Almost two years after a student died during a vicious ritual of a student association in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police reported.
Officials said that he had been blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target across a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng passed out and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, according to the police.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, to seek advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and basically placed the welfare of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted with blunt force injuries to the head, torso and thigh.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student has died from the harassment every year since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with harassing attacks and the formation of a criminal organization.
"We don't just want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will also hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its membership of the local community.
This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
An increase in interest rates will come, and the buzz will be shaken, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it'll take and how long it'll last.
In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance to the process.
A recession occurred within only 11 months of the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, albeit not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they are starting to raise interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the excitement may have been exaggerated due to an interest rate hike.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the "cheap money" era," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a message to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still to a low level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a historical trend-based view of how some sectors of the economy might react:
As the market has seen last month, anticipating interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for asset income to be strangled 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what happened after the Fed raised interest rates.
More specifically, over the past 35 years, the market has mostly been in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on its way to raising interest rates, fairly flat in the 250 days thereafter (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, Chief Investment Stratege at Nuveen Asset Management, published at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on equity begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate hikes often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
What is most remarkable here is that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point when the Fed raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, with the 118 interest rate hikes since 1950, nominal GDP was only below 4.5 percent twice.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate hikes on such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question "whether it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have been prepared for a Fed interest rate hike all year round, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading only indicates a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all the cycles of increase from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and put pre-recession levels in the shade very quickly after the start of recovery," the report says.
By contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
Fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic price.
For bonds, yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/reduction occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to converge and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher returns," said Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting, says Jones, that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stronger monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have widened and volatility has increased - all the features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large, companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US will benefit from rising interest rates and making local products more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off, as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and also the financing of their debts.
"History shows that "quality" shares tend to respond very positively three months after an initial interest rate hike," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a customer report.
Firms with a strong balance sheet exceeded firms with a weak balance sheet by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also outperformed their low quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits from higher returns, even if experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the station for its "dumbness"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits
Parliament colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the station to prove that it is doing something that private broadcasters do not do.
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public radio station was "dumb" and increasingly no longer distinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dumb" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be only under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something else -- these are two spontaneous examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director General rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music making that is truly unsurpassed.
"And I think the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that work must be done harder to engage the audience than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport for kicking the commercial rival.
Tory deputy Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "on a special BBC course".
He added that he wanted the company to "find a hit from our in-house stable" the next time it starts an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money on fee payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose the slowest in August and the Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since records began in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago by the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe Black Friday slowed down spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase over the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when buyers started shopping with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, e.g. at home on the sofa.
But now this is stalling, and we may be experiencing a reduction in growth.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers flocked around their computers to make their bargains, and some dealer sites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, on which buyers fought for bargains, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of 5 £ issues, a little more than 1 £ was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca in crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims through the streets at the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partly blames the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin-Laden group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed into Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Mournings filled, largely dressed in white, the track to pay their respects when the first of the dead began their last journey to the Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The mourning procession passed by the Holy Place, where only days before a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the praying.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the Bin Laden family construction company for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 praying people who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
Saudi officials have already firmly agreed that the Hajj will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said that the Bin Laden group shouldn't have left the crane's arm standing when it wasn't used.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi State Press Agency, said that the Bin Laden Group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not report this detail, but said that the company's leadership was forbidden to travel abroad.
At the beginning of this week Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that plunged into a large mosque courtyard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Hajj, which will take place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements on the breakdown of the crane and its representatives have not been available to comment.
The Royal Decree also reprimanded the group for non-current security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people are staying in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rial (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European artisans is over
British increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 additional Screwfix stores aimed at craftsmen
At the same time Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Brits lay down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home.
If you can skillfully handle a hammer or brush to paint walls, you seem to be a minority nowadays.
The British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes, according to the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the hardware store chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at the lowest prices is now outdated.
Kingfisher therefore plans to open 200 additional Screwfix shops, which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, men predominate among the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households performing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "There is still a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to shift this more towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions about the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, one of only five women at the top of a UK-listed leading company in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and CFO.
Mrs Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't difficult to find good women for our board of directors.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profits and sales after the Group shouldered the cost of closing stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
On Wednesday, two functionaries of the Austrian volleyball champion Aich/Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion at the Landesgericht Klagenfurt.
The defendants did not plead guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was finally acquitted of this charge in May.
The current process has been adjourned.
According to Chief Prosecutor Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it had become clear that the defendants used funds from association accounts through which they were allowed to distribute in their functions for private purposes between 2006 and 2011.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial offenses.
The president of the Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin, dismissed this fact.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
In order to reject the infidelity, the defence stated that the association had not at any time suffered any loss of assets.
The sports officials had only offset expenses and led the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of the debt - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to about 600,000 shillings (about 44,000 euros).
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: do we continue to run the club or are we locking up?" said one of the defendants, in the Brotberuf Großbetriebsprüfer des Finanzamts.
He then decided with his colleague and fellow defendant to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We advanced money, put our life insurances as security at the bank," he said at the time of collection.
The association had been agreed: you can manage the money freely, only no debts can be made.
In addition, the payment of the compensation for expenses had been decided retroactively until 1991 - if financial success is appropriate.
Therefore, part of the expenses compensation was paid only years later, namely from 2003, when there was a plus in the account.
Therefore, flat-rate and not detailed bookings also appeared, the former chairman explained the processes.
The two defendants jointly managed the accounts and savings books, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payouts had not been disclosed to the club in detail.
The association had not been interested in detail in the financial arrangement, the only important thing was the debt-freeness, said the answer.
In 2011, when an official began an investigation into abuse of office, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club account.
These were reserves, the defendants explained.
This security account ran in the name of the second defendant and according to his statement was not known to the association.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The respondent for a long time did not know the answer.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known about that money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The co-defendant had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as a "reparation of damage".
Why compensation for damages?, wanted to know judge and prosecutor.
The first defendant then stated that he did not agree with this wording because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what am I supposed to do if the lawyer says, "You're all out of line with him."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he had never received a cent salary, he only charged mileage and diets.
On diets he charged the association 1,000 euros per month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to provide accurate documents for the early years.
They explained that these were no longer stored after an audit in which everything had been judged correct.
Kilometer money had also been taken by the second defendant.
All corrections had been made in cash, and he had to drive from his home in Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on September 23rd with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard paints another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the staff reduction that has been ongoing for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs in the division of the company.
The job cuts at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) can't stop.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to reduce the number of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate banking sector.
This will save costs of 2.7 billion dollars (2.4 billion euros), the company announced on Tuesday.
The move will result in a special charge of around 2.7 billion dollars, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter onwards.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs, which has been ongoing for three years, has not yet been completed.
HP still had around 302,000 employees at the end of the 2013/14 financial year.
The Hewlett Packard share declined 2.3 percent after the sale.
The group of printers from Palo Alto, California, currently splits up: The computer and printer business is to be bundled into a new company this year - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as the other services.
Both parts of the business are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A once again disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services last increased the world's second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third quarter at the end of July, sales of PCs and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
This led to a decline in revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds to the change in the industry with a split and massive job cuts.
The 76-year-old company led by Meg Whitman has only reacted late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide for a total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority supports the anti-IS training mission
A direct involvement of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq would, however, be largely opposed: 54 percent opposed it, and 35 percent supported it.
The fact that other states fly air strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is positive for 61 percent.
24 percent oppose intervening in the conflict.
Cooperation with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would be in favour.
29 percent couldn't make up their mind.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The exhibition will focus on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show on Thursday under the motto "Mobility Connects".
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday on.
As two years ago, the organizers of the VDA Auto-Verband expect around 900,000 visitors.
Röszke: Outburst of violence on the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police used tear gas and water cannons at the Serbian border at Röszke against several hundred angry refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border crossing point.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
Behind it a police line had formed and behind the police there was a water cannon.
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officers first used pepper spray continuously.
Then the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
This disbanded the group.
The refugees have now withdrawn a little while ago.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from shortness of breath.
The press officers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching when the US Federal Reserve meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade or not.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half of those who thought the Fed was going to do this last week now think that the Fed will stay a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed put interest on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may be leaving the zero range and starting a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior staff member at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good performance level, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances of such a move are good.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday
Death shooter at Delta State University left letters of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before later that day he shot and killed his colleague - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to tell him that he was "suffering" at the first murder and wanted "he could undo it," authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 a.m. Monday morning.
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the 911 staff that the police had to send police officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house, but "no one will bother," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities on Tuesday said there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangular relationship."
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who stated that they had been married for about seven years.
They were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19 and she was "destructed."
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles.
The police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "He won't go to jail."
Later that night, when officers caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb drove his car aside, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a Ph.D. from Delta State University in spring 2015, as his mood for life indicates on the university's website.
Stars who have lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, due to cancer.
The actor is also alleged to be struggling with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
I'm sure all this will take its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is renovating the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major restructuring of the Group.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation alone.
150 of the around 1000 executives worldwide will cost the company's job.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is rebuilding its corporate structure and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment is to contribute around EUR 500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer be a board member for passenger business in the future.
The Eurowings low-cost airline should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the Executive Board team headed by Chief Carsten Spohr.
With the repositioning, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000-strong company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three-quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with pilots
In the tariff conflict with the Pilots' Association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations are to be resumed this Thursday after the court-stopped strike.
That's what the union told us.
Discussions will focus on the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants "to achieve sustainable results in one year with a forecast record result" as soon as possible.
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots, the background is the savings concept "Wings".
Lufthansa plans to outsource routes to Eurowings' own low-cost line in the fight against competitors.
Under the title "Morgenzug in den Süden", paintings by Leena Krüger can be seen in the Künstlerhaus.
For the White Hall of the House, the Finnish woman, who has been based in Göttingen for a long time, has compiled a selection of titleless works that animate her viewers to embark on a journey of thought.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this will make the left-wing defender cry and exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double leg fracture and he's in the hospital."
He'll be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United when he's 18, has a hard time and then plays fantastic, and then that happens.
In the changing room he had an oxygen mask on.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account was: "Thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my path to recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Referring to this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat of the PSV
With the European Championship in France, the defender of England has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player with this kind of injury leaves the place, they are all very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in another direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
It is one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you may be David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, the environmental fable by Dr. Seuss, published in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I like to read to my children, because there always seems to be a picture or message that we've missed so far."
All well and well, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a summary of the film version of 2012, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"Amidst the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if that were not yet suspicious enough: Cameron's text reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins like this: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book. Here, an unnamed boy hears the local environment being devastated by the greedy, tree-cutting, thneed-knitting once-ler despite the protests of the name-giving lorax, a squatting, purrbearous being, "speaking in the name of the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A downing street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, but did not give any more immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened with exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
To meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the squad that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook's site may be less experienced than that three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setup, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear any scars from 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it is an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
On this note: Adam Lyth leaves the England Test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to skip Adam Lyth is, of course, hard for me to analyze as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricketers are focused on results.
There were no question marks on Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination because - and I said this earlier - players are their own best pickers.
Long ago, the course of Lyth would have been extended, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he makes more runs for Yorkshire, there'll be another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not perform so well, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test hit man gets to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only accusation one can make was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hit man I highly appreciate.
He is an X-factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us in a Trent Bridge place, which hit us very much.
He must get at least the same chances as those before him, but of course this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen beat next to Cook, which would provide an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, came up, and I don't mind.
I don't see why a hit man can't beat there, and this left-handed guy has already shown that he's a devil's guy of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number three for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the cadre as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at his stats - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there are no large numbers of backup spiders that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a champion coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I have always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the changing room can bring fresh air, even if the news is in line with what has been said before.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not in the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team performers do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made lightly at heart.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could gain momentum if the economy went into a slump by 2017
David Cameron's untapped renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble every day, even without the choice of the ingenious Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn becomes the leader of Labour or the TUC, which is violently trampling on Tuesday because of Europe.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is and not always out of their own fault, are fed up with Britain's own agenda of split concessions and disruptive treaty changes, which they usually do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it does not like them to endanger social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and finance minister climb on summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local greats, then come home and say they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants an outside-looking Great Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin - lets see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany's cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as happened with the excessively long endurance like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left.
It's hard to imagine that they're gonna rip off a leg to help the selfie Brits, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don't want either, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
As a result, some such ministers may even deliberately plan unhelpful comments, in the SNP style, while Britain's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a failure" and "Great Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press baron, as it was not during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can hardly remember Boris Johnson, the arch-euro opportunist who made a name for himself as an "EU-straight-banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the medley of tax-fearing villains, telephone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similar about her, but found that if you're sitting in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better hand out bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blair than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's referendum vortex, because Blair had put the principle above the EU's unadopted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus opening a back door for him.
The press never forgave him that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on my back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he no longer needs to waste time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch's strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I say it kindly - in development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most of the people outside of Ukip's traditional blue colour tendency and the wilder realms of Tory's small Englishmanism can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn said on the radio and on television this week, when the scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of provoking John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried on television to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay "in all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow fighters and MPs according to all the reports at their retreat on Monday night.
Whatever the touching bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the vortex of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe that will allow him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins must think so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissism of small differences is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in everything.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost cut by the Tory government in power, as I was reminded at the start of Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize report from Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Claims of a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Basic Report" last month and describes it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinary windy basis" on which PHE justified its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in order to produce a synthesis of their opinions on the damage of various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director is said to have previously received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting stated that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding they had previously reportedly received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for selecting the members of the panel are not provided, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their tobacco control know-how.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE tobacco line.
The group's research "significantly admits" that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage of most products to most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Well-Being at PHE, said that the claims of BMJ had been responded to before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second person who smokes for life dies of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to this, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what is evidence and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, former head of Channel 4 says
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in fiercely controversial time frames against the most popular shows of their rivals and broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried to get in touch with the BBC without success for six years in his time at Channel 4.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC is commissioning or sending programs that are also clearly shown by non-subsidised rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee in the course of his study of the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or order.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, of course it's nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax program could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both self-production.
Frankly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this is supposed to be public-law television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series running Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for hunting for ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows reflect what former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-law niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you can't quite measure the audience, but they do their job, and they can argue if they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion in radio fees, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put her in a window where no one ever wanted to see her.
On the radio fee, Johnson told the committee, "I call on you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions which can get the best value from this.
Of course, you all think, we all think that you get a lot of value here for £150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for £150, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission "to inform, educate and entertain".
He said that little of BBC production is now officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and she should take an example on the public television channels in Australia and Canada to change this into "inform, educate and entertain".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said that only a handful will be shown on television, and enter into alliances with commercial channels to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction in the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on Motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
Further information: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses to people's brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Threadworms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their Motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When applying ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted to the worms where they turn on the modified motoneurons.
The process has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent to the desired location in the brain in an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissues unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make targeted human neurons susceptible to ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
The Ads Shame Britain’s Arms Trade
Amnesty International anti-weapons trade show video.
Terrible killer drones!
ankle smashing leg restraints!
Cluster bombs!
And electric batons that cause agonizing pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad is a militant parody for the world's largest arms fair, produced by Amnesty International, to highlight the British government's willingness to throw away weapons to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters, which can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look.
"Important announcement: Are you travelling with DLR from September 15 to 18?" (Docklands Light Railway) can be read in the typefaces of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which turns into an image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will travel with DLR ... Customers are asked to help stop the weapons trade fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 pack of inbus keys, which is claimed to have "access to about a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this posterizing "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and realize that they have to go out into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trade posters greets commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profitly with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence surrounding advertising for the Arms Fair - through a blank space of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic shady corporate advertising, but "by blushing with bright colors and animation it remains more attached."
"They did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is the intervention of the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be dealt with illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the Waffenmesse comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab discloses an order from the U.S. Army on "the AT4CS RS shot down from the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped battle head that delivers outstanding after-effect effects inside the target."
Whatever it does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Residences
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student home, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I annoyed - and the many long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entry into student dormitories ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely frightening.
It's tempting to chat: people tell you where you came from, whether and where you took Sabbath year, where you are related to Corbyn and why you "honestly said Marmite neither love nor hate, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you find out the people you like, unlike those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers were.
Leave people alone.
People's rooms often turn into drinks receptions, film-night venues and community meeting places, but they are also the places where people dress and put their underwear on.
Concerning this: Do not think about starting a relationship at university
Introverts receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student dorms form a space-to-room stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone who's trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy I've used up for interacting with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student of sociability is exhausted - and send him a text message instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my dorms had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Make friendship by baking.
Since you start the university at the height of the back Mania, knocking at the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the welcome of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering home-made treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk and may eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Badly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to stand asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in dormitories.
Of course, stealing chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check that with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my roommate, who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You should not make noise that prevents people from sleeping or working.
It's not just about being a decent person, it's about you being one of the people sitting in the glasshouse in the truest sense of the saying.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they cared about making drum & bass a little quieter, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep another two hours before she let her own music burst, closed her door and went to her three - hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dormitory?
On the other hand, wouldn't it be terribly embarrassing for you to think of a roommate as your future spouse, get close to her, break up and then have to see her every day and maybe see her drag all her friends over to her?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to convince your abdomen a little sense of reason.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone left his keys in his unlocked room, the border between an ulcer and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments for him to become a boomerang.
Give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety by hiding - but never screw up anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close her door and place her keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not stack her possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Townhouses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses in the Mittefrankischen Eckental for people who do not have much money.
So for refugees, for example - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need living space, but also the single mother and the low earner."
"I show how you can still build cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in an interview
Thousands of refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how to create cheap housing quickly: he is building terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
In view of the influx of refugees, we need sufficient housing in the coming decades.
A completely banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
It's different when you put people in blocks of flats.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a common room.
There may be a lot of refugees saying it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Have the building regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I did my project correctly under construction law.
Especially complicated it always makes the threatening Damoclesschwert special building and the parking regulations.
Scary.
It is still assumed that anyone who creates three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three parking spaces.
Only in the cities the space is missing.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don't you intensify the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True: We have had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earner.
I'll show you how to build cheaply and well today.
That's what this is about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tap "General" and then select "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, as they get an error message indicating that the "software update failed".
To avoid the problem, users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself takes you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space – but Apple has made this unlikely by narrowing the update. Similarly, it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them as soon as the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is close to a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off half way and this could lead to a crash of the update.

You should also make sure that you have reviewed our checklist of all things before downloading to prevent things from going wrong and protecting themselves if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
The World Cup second stressed before the start of the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing left to lose".
53 points separate the runner-up champion before the night race in Singapore this Sunday from defending champion and double champion Hamilton.
The British have already won seven of the previous twelve season races and are also the favourite of the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British rider won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will influence the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
A haze bell has been hanging over the city for days, caused by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for the cure.
Gauselmann is the bearer of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation received by chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot pay the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search will also be promoted.
Gauselmann hopes that membership in the chess club and friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Weiß" will be seen as an expression of his attachment to the spa town.
Quartiersbüro seeks direct contact
Saludis and the old people's centre Antonistift have teamed up under the guise of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The Social Foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city centre.
More specifically, Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and those seeking advice will now receive information on questions such as care insurance or health and care insurance benefits.
For years, our outpatient care service has shown that caregivers are often left alone.
There are endless questions.
"Nevertheless, many cash benefits are not used, because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood," explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital and the outpatient service "Amadeus" as business unit manager for Altenhilfe.
In addition to the consultations, the new Quartiersbüro also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers from the Seniors Centre and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The Senior Care Centre," said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
Both managing directors see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre as particularly due to demographic change.
This makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the inauguration ceremonies, the district office also dedicates itself to isolation in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite to a regular social gathering".
Thus, the social foundation makes a big contribution that senior citizens can live independently and well in their familiar environment.
The Quartiersbüro is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg vs. Würzburger Kickers on October 6th
Now it is official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third Bundesliga player Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6th of October has now been set as an appointment.
The match of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the 8th final of the Bavarian Football Totopocal against the third Bundesliga player FC Würzburger Kickers was finally terminated.
The event will take place on Tuesday, October 6, at 7 p.m. in the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game is going on, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the ticket pre-sale that has now started.
It's special for our team to play against a third-party player.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlights have a special appeal.
FC Eintracht Bamberg joined the last 16 teams in 2010 by winning 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.

Viennese architect Karl Mang passed away 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was said in the issue.
Born in 1922 in Vienna, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but has also worked as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned with the establishment of the treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and the conversion of the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking Penalty: Tim Wiese throws money at policewoman
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese was not well noticed in Bremen.
Once upon a time, Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, is a wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to have increased 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the last two years.
He didn't increase intellectually.
Wiese had his hair cut in the city centre of Bremen when he saw a parking guard issuing a parking ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro outside.
Wiese then stormed out of the business, insulted the official and threw the due fine at her feet, as reported by the "Bild" newspaper.
With the city of Bremen the accusations are confirmed, but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under examination," it says from the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether or not meadow is displayed.
Panama Authorities Destroy 4500 Marijuana Plants
The fertile soil and the rainforest climate of the Isla del Rey are ideal for the flowering of marijuana plants.
For three days now, the Panamanian authorities have been tearing out the 4500 plants and burning them.
Men beat up 17-year-old Afghans
The police are looking for witnesses for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 11:45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
According to the police, one of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five metres and called on them to wait for him.
At that time the group was at the level of the bft petrol station.
There were also three people on the grounds of the gas station.
One of these men then yelled at the young man and punched him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a fracture of his nose and bled heavily out of his nose.
When his two friends hurried to and appeased the bat, he initially let go of his victim.
The injured young man was brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car to their apartment and drove there several times demonstratively.
When the vehicle was no longer visible, the injured man walked in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the bat and another male person.
A baton was used to beat the victim’s face and thighs.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, only a vague description of the perpetrators is available.
One of the men was about six feet tall.
The second bat is said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and whistleblowers to call 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Felstehausen practice and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Velvet municipality mayor Bernd Bormann, business sponsor Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased about this.
Doctors are missing in many places in the country - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Felstehausen on October 1st.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich will be standing by his successor with half a job in the next few months.
After a conversion phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then investing 310000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing her specialist training in the Verden hospital and wants to get into practice next year as well.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When the time came, I just called her."
The Müller couple liked the idea of operating their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years".
He also sees being his own boss as an advantage soon.
And so they agreed, the millers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, the two-time father Frank Müller also grew up, followed his medical studies in Hanover in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior emergency doctor in the Diepholz district and volunteered in the DRK-Beleihschaft Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a family doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as family doctors.
"The endoscopy comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a speaking room more.
In addition, the computer is completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a grant of a total of 50000 euros as part of a funding programme from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the velvet municipality (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue," emphasises Bernd Bormann, mayor of the municipality.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2000 patients come to Felstehausen every quarter, while the average practice in Northern Germany is about 500.
In Asendorf there is another general practitioner's practice.
A positive side effect of Frank Müller's adoption of the practice: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had found herself, she would have left.
By the way, anyone who visits Müller's office hours continues to look above all into familiar faces: takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning staff from the Felstehausens.
With their departure an era ends in Asendorf, after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," remembers Ursel Felstehausen smiling.
She felt a little melancholy after the long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will surely still see many patients many times," says the internist.
Her husband laughs, "We have a 6000 square meter property."
"So far, I've always pressed myself in front of gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now border controls are also being raised at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It was still clear that anyone wishing to apply for asylum could do so "of course".
The care and safety of the people is in the foreground.
But it is also clear that "clear signals are needed," said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept boundless migration flows, not even across the Austro-Slovenian border.
It takes a controlled approach.
Croatia considering "Corridor" - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously stated that Slovenia also wanted incoming refugees to travel to Austria and Germany, and that it might also establish corridors for the refugees.
However, this is not exactly how Minister of the Interior Vesna Györkös Znidar saw in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable", but Slovenia would step up the surveillance of the border, especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, was already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, however, Slovenians do not want to close their borders for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil his or her obligations, otherwise the system will not work," stressed Györkös Znidar.
According to the Croatian government, the first refugees had already tried to arrive in Eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in the night hours of Tuesday to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick her up in the nearby corn fields.
According to the local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in Croatian Tovarnik ever since.
They were mainly Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation.
In the coming days, his country is expecting around 4000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted to Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media in agreement on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was to instruct people to take certain routes: "Neither can we nor do we want to do so," it said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and more buses would be expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been travelling all night from the Macedonian border, some 500 kilometers away, through Serbia.
"We heard that Hungary closed, so the police told us to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could actually lead to the shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, already predicted by observers, to a somewhat more westerly route.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member had "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
Strict controls are being carried out to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of the EU since 2007, and the EU partners have consistently been a good witness to the country in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees remain behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they would have spent last night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
It is still unclear whether the remaining refugees want to continue to the Croatian border.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local show in Horgos: he considered the debates on alternative routes of refugees to be premature after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It could not yet be said whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia are marked.
However, crossing the border between Serbia and Croatia is not safe: in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatia war uncleared minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance personnel was sent to the border region.
Stock market hackers: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is said to have been part of a ring of cybercriminals accused of repeatedly gaining insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information collected is said to have been used to make insider dealing in financial markets.
In this way, the investigators reported that a total of over 100 million dollars had been spent.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our country's borders will ultimately be caught," says the SEC Communication.
The trials against 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted both in the USA and from Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheim Paradeplatz there is a lively operation.
People do their errands, sometimes fast steps, sometimes leisurely strolling.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim Motor Show at Paradeplatz.
Trams stop.
Pulsating, blazing life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large tables each with the headline "Before I die I want to"....
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is faced with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so with the action we went into the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to passersby for questions and discussions as well as the volunteers.
While some passers-by spontaneously grabs the chalk and adds the sentence "yes to my life", "read", "travel through the USA with the camper", "stop the war" or "don't suffer for long", others stop short, read, say sentences like "I'm not that far yet" and then go on.
Again and again small discussions develop on the sidelines about the action itself, about life, the handling of death.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I realize that the end of this world will come to me at some point in time can I live responsibly," says the director of the Deaconian work Mannheim, which together with the Caritas Association is the bearer of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this publicity-effective action to the 20-year-old is good.
However, it was understandable that not everyone wanted to communicate publicly on the panels, after all, it was a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death is still subject to taboos, according to Josefine Lammer's experience, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed much to people's openness.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with the topic through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to become involved in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid called for volunteers, it immediately registered and was present at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany the affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the hospice of Saint Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle her task and the experiences and experiences she has made.
"I see the life of another wait, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenical Hospice Service is free of charge and independent of denominations.
The financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as further trainings and supervisions of the death and mourning companions.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The panels described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, too, further personal wishes can be noted on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial outlook for 2016 decreased
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook to a full year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for vacation.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84 according to a FactSet survey.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which are on average 4.9 percent and will take effect on 4 January and despite higher increases for ground transport of heavy and large parcels, which will be collected from November.
The company said that it still expects earnings to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "is yielding solid returns by considering weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, which plans to recruit 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6% more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share predicted by twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has stagnated sales in its Express shipping unit.
But the boom in online shopping has increased FedEx Ground's results.
In the last quarter, sales of ground transport increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At its most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahogani table to decide whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Threatening over them, there is a mural of the United States at one end of the decorated two - story meeting room.
The card is a reminder that Fed chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests before all other things.
The Central Bank has a dual mandate from Congress: Maximizing US employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented incentive by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economic data show that it is growing solidly, the recent turbulence in global financial markets may frighten the already cautious Fed representatives to increase this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds - even by only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed is going to do, which in itself is unsettling the financial market.
About half of the economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted an interest rate hike this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator that only shows a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate, unless the strategists mitigate the impact by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed lifted the sentences at this time," he said.
If she does, "it would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts argued that an interest rate hike would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well in the way of increasing the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be required, they expect an increase in the rate this year.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was consistently below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the strain on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world shrugged together at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% in May when investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with Dow now almost 10% below the May high.
For the Fed representatives, the market turbulence influences the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy hadn't occurred in the last few weeks, they would attract the reins at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to better control the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's main concerns, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by former head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "constrict" its monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global asset management strategy of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that seem to be unrelated to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee entitled to vote, who is committed to raising interest rates, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited visible impact on US growth," said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should place financial stability in first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Poznan, former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The recent turbulences do not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly doesn't want to get into the situation where she's afraid of raising interest rates because the markets are upset," said Poznan, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should be ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/camp opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market/camp is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The cooking kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this shop is close to the cash registers and has various take-away options.
What is there: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry for you on request.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, cattle blood and bile, pork natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the cash register.
Where it is: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Little life support for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
To give them a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a number of people who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
Even with her 74 Lenzen she still likes to teach.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum home on Dillinger Straße.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from a real school.
Brazil’s Pediatric Society Rio Grande Promotes Nutrition for Healthy Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS tries to shockingly inform women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding. It does so with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipal council of Bernried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar system.
The planning for the long-awaited gym construction on the Bernrieder sports grounds is progressing step by step: In the most recent municipal council meeting, the completed building application was unanimously approved without major discussions.
Prior to this, the panel had, among other things, decided on a request for a building law "exception" or "liberation" from the valid building plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special shape regarding the roof construction.
According to this, a "sattel roof with non-middle first and roof overhang" is to be built.
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This gives us a wonderfully large south roof together," explained Mayor Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the roof inclination, which for energy reasons - unlike the construction plan prescribed - should be below ten degrees.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" became necessary because the building plan does not allow "exceptions" regarding the roof inclination - whereby the Bernried municipal council usually applies restrictively in the case of exemption requests.
However, gymnasium construction is not a recurring project: "We are not creating a precedent," says Steigenberger.
Gymnastics building at the Sportzentrum is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
About 2.3 million euros are included in costs.
Grants are expected from school and grassroots sports promotion.
In the next process step, the construction application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be submitted to the Landratsamt for examination.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new Medical Director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is provided by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, which was confirmed by regional councilwoman Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, the Supervisory Board will take a decision on this, and it will meet next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority should move with Fischer and the further existing Inner Station to Schongau.
The rooms were available.
According to Jochner-Weiß, employees who cannot go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim.
The employees were informed about the plans.
The change was triggered by the resignation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been medical director of the Schongau Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play when it came to the question of who should succeed him, who agreed to take over as of October 1st and change to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau this means in any case a "evaluation" and a broadening of the offer in the field of "internal medicine", according to Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
In a transitional manner for the next two years Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will lead both houses, until next year the former hospital of scarcity, which still has 35 beds, in Peißenberg is to be finally closed after almost 140 years.
Until now, the district had planned this for 2018 when the ongoing renovation at the Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Landratin Jochner-Weiß, who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board, countered rumors that the house, which is owned by the Federal Knappschaft, will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers.
"I exclude this." As the property continues, Jochner-Weiß could not say that there are several considerations.
There is currently a short-term care of the Caritas and a day psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back", says Fischer about the quasi-movement to the Lech, which had been received "positively and very understandingly" by the employees.
There was no real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years.
He had been asked by Schongau colleagues to take over the position of Medical Director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (one hundred beds) has been threatened with closure over the past decades, and departments have been closed, such as surgery and obstetrics.
The handballers of the Rhein-Neckar lions are required this evening (20.15) at Bergisches HC.
The leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for arrogance.
Last season, the Badeners made a painful defeat at the BHC and have to make up for something there.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the aberning on a corn field near Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg), several hunters were in action, as the police reported.
After a shot was fired, a 63-year-old and a 22-year-old man suffered severe injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident could happen was initially unclear.
Criminal investigation.
Missing 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of violent crimes
A suspect has led the police to the body of 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate who have been missing since Saturday.
In interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the young people and throwing her body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, according to prosecutors and police on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, also arrested on Tuesday evening, is considered to be a suspect, who admitted the crime and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed the night before after a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
When searching for the young woman, the investigators first came across the victim's personal belongings.
During interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, a suspicion against the 20-year-old finally arose.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the arrested man admitted in police interrogation that he killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old should be brought before the prison judge on Wednesday, the investigators charge him with manslaughter.
The purpose of the investigation is to find out more about the circumstances of the crime.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns against housing gap
The location on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also seeking an affordable place to stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overloaded in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable apartments.
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the Association Alliance "Social Housing".
For comparison: This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
This means that 140,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first-entry accommodation.
Many then come across the housing market and join the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
However, according to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees.
The study also shows significant shortcomings in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is pushing ahead with a housing deficit that is growing from year to year.
Currently around 770,000 housing units have already been missing in the conurbations, laments Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many working people therefore lived in large cities in WG-Zimmern.
Young adults stayed involuntarily longer at the "Hotel Mama" because of the slump in the housing market.
In the big cities, the number of square metres per capita has fallen for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the Alliance "Social Housing" proposes a fresh start.
In doing so, new incentives are to stimulate social housing.
In this way, the real estate tax could be waived and the real estate tax for subsidised dwellings suspended for a limited period.
In addition, according to the alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation by Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been called up on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free passage: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
There is virtually no way to get to Hungary, as more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will pass through Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to reach agreement with the neighbouring country Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organise a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees left for Croatia to travel from there to Western Europe.
500 people came across the border near Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television station RTL.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees the day before.
Moreover, new laws that entered into force on the same day make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on the border between Serbia and the EU neighbouring country of Croatia in the morning.
According to most media reports, they came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came by bus as well as taxis to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot across the green border.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
For this purpose, the border strip poses other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mine removers are now to quickly create a safe passage.
However, few refugees come to Hungary after the closure of the border.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people.
Shortly before the goal was closed on Monday, it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify overcoming and damaging the border fence as a criminal offence.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated.
The sentenced people are threatened with prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications had been received on Tuesday in the "transit zones" newly established at the border, of which almost all - 93 - were at Röszke's most important transition.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees would have been there.
In practice, however, no one has any chance of obtaining asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke workers began to clean up.
They collected the garbage left by tens of thousands of people on the side of the road in recent weeks.
Lock grids were dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border village was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the goal of this conversion.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, only a few refugees reach Austria.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
According to the government, however, about 20,000 migrants were still in the country.
In Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instructions of German authorities.
Smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot in Freilassing.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"After the bridge festival on Sunday, we were busy cleaning up when suddenly ten people with suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
But because Germany had unexpectedly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the influx of refugees, they ended up in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and chauffeured the stranded people together with two other helpers and their cars across the border into the near Passau.
Before that, we first served the unexpected guests with snack and drinks.
We said we'd take her to Passau by car.
"That was a matter of course for us," says Stadler in the OÖN conversation.
You were very grateful.
A man did not take it to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
"We were very pleased with that," says Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau on Sunday evening in Wels, in order to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that the rail traffic to Germany was stopped.
However, the regional train was parked in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein the cross-border is generally high on course.
The Brückenfest connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, the day before a two-bridge race sporting - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is sending more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately helping in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity in the Röszke camp, our Chancellor has pushed the Hungarian government's attitude into the haze of National Socialism, both officially and publicly.
The victims of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to find out that the "promised country" that invited them and welcomed them is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, in view of the ongoing flows of refugees and the approaching winter, to create decent conditions for protection seekers.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-fested quarters
Konrad has his hands full with the refugee shelter.
Christian Konrad is used to his word having weight.
The government has appointed the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to provide quarters for the thousands of refugees.
Konrad has already mastered the chaos in the first recording centre in Traiskirchen.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported about his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday had also taken place without much fuss, said Konrad and praised the organizational "master achievement".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
Konrad expects a total of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 accommodations have to be found in the next weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the federal states, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can make it.
"But it's not a barrel without ground," Konrad said.
He has already had talks with the governors.
These had assured him that he would also create quarters for the coming refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, and we will discuss how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also places great expectations in the ORF action "Helping like us".
Private individuals can easily offer accommodation on the platform.
In addition, one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it could not be that neighbourhood owners have to comply with a certain height of the towel racks or the size of the skylights.
"Emergency standards" should apply for a limited period of time.
Konrad explains with his experience that, unlike the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful in housing.
I am an elderly gentleman who is not easily told the untruth in his face.
Persuasiveness is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not incur any costs for the Republic, as they explained themselves.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
His own search for accommodation has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to put up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there seem to be problems with the permit.
Linz calls for a better division
For the time being, the city of Linz is not planning to open up urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for the Accommodation of Refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, since the persons concerned can currently be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
In the event of an emergency, however, additional locations will be checked for their suitability.
The head of the city criticises the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Boundaries are not sealed off"
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) accorded the further action on the refugee question on Monday.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders would not be sealed off.
It was still possible for refugees to continue their journey to the Federal Republic of Germany.
However, there was now the corresponding border controls.
There will be no special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
Of the other EU member states, Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity on the refugee issue.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is once again introducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of the German approach.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "New Shipyard" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T has moved in, the rest (2,700 square meters) will be rented out to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to make them work for us," says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies of the New Shipyard and later acquiring them.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from Techcenter, which each owns one third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining in the building are already rented out, and for another 40 percent there are inquiries.
Lia Peroni owner opened second business in the arcade
Furla handbags are the focus of the new shop.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to quickly postpone this project in the pigeon market arcade: after all, she has now gained growth in the form of another business location.
In the Furla shop opposite the store, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from different manufacturers, everything is now about women's handbags of the Furla brand, purses are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks had been rebuilt.
"I've been thinking for a long time, though, if I should open another store," says Breit.
The decisive factor for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also impressed by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the greater Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who themselves have Italian roots.
Her fashion interest got Breit from her mother in the cradle.
I'm best suited when something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why some women get enraptured at the sight of a beautiful handbag, neither can the professional woman answer with any certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag enhances every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatinate ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called euphoria.
This quality also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for agitators.
Whether he expresses himself xenophobicly, approaches journalists rudely or reveals gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office strongly incites the election campaign.
And he's good at it.
This is also registered in the Palatinate town of Kall, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the Föhnfrisur is a term for many in the wine village on the Weinstraße.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant place is over -zig corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in election mode.
Kallstadtress Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think of his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but are also not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt style," says Simone Wendel.
Born in Kallstadt, Kallstadtrin has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous offspring, which includes not only Trump but also the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014), saying that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He didn't bring it to the King of Hearts there.
While there is respect for the performance of the family, the opinion that Trump is "a little bit of a big mouth" also tends to be, says Wendel.
Randomly the nickname that Kallstadt has in its vicinity, "The Brulljesmacher" - to High German: the blokes, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the show-offs.
Trump's success story began in 1885 when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold digger's place in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate company was first land purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged at that time.
He had not recorded Trump because he had once left without permission, the director of the Institute for Palatine History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the film to start.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigrant".
This contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendent.
He had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"As the poltert, it's not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandpa was born Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distant, "he is always so exhilarating".
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
Pension host Veronika Schramm, like many Kallstadters, mentions that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
It would be better if he could not vote, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good".
If those who were in charge in the United States at the time of his grandfather had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says winemaker daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
And: "The grapes are ripe even without President Trump".
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12 000 cinematographers, and interest is also aroused in the US.
The Upper Bavarian community of Ramsau bei Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
From the hands of the Vice President of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 "Bergsteigerdörfer" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Club there is responsible for awarding the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liberals, but there has been no major shift in ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was aired by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull overthrew Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with the presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international TV shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance didn't seem to matter to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained below that of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September Sunrise stands at 314,000 at Today with an average of 349,000 spectators.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thanks for checking!

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decided to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
Seven's X-Factor remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726.000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot-Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour a full 720,000.
Hot-Seat averages 620,000.
The decline in The Chase Australia's second-night ratings will make Nine confident that Hot-Seat will eventually prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to outstrip the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman who ended up with Sam Wood in The Bachelor was wrapped up in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who has received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons Fellows on the day before three two become, you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood holds his lips tightly sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have been lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should receive Wood's last rose?", their answers could become a spoiler of who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly - except for themselves - called Mackay the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that throughout the show," said Jeavons Fellows.
"Sarah is standing on earth with both feet, it's so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the house visit last week made it clear to her that Wood could be "the one".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now totally committed to him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a scramble as the Aussie rugby league convert did in his first punt return on Tuesday at the 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to return to a punt and also to the ongoing game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his post-game press conference.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about his messed-up catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne paws at a punt restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the Fumble swearing and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his original debut in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posting it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian battlefield with gun violence.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized and his democratic efforts stopped.
The Free Voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
Party and political group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW Autumn Clause in Großwallstadt about a serious crisis in Bavaria's schools if there are not correspondingly new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise we will get faults in the Bavarian education system."
The Landtag faction of the Free Voters meets until Friday in the Lower Franconian Commune.
In fact, there were very different main issues to be addressed.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Electoral Meeting.
"Of course, the topic of asylum will overlay the exam," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they were during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s.
"It doesn't go on like this, we have to get to the causes," said the Free Voter Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport the Free Voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum actions: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW chief criticized that several federal states were not consistent: "We would need uniform standards of the federal states nationwide."
"Bavaria pushes off, others don't."
"We need to become more capable of action."
But the national policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-term torch remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Education Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot experiment "Medium level plus" at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the secondary level is tested from three to four years - in the result it then takes again nine years until the Abitur.
But Aiwanger doesn't go far enough.
"The topic of G9 must be accelerated," said the FW CEO.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want it.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
Harder Wall Street Helps Dax Jump on the Jumps
The German stock market closed with profits after a directionless and nervous trading course over long distances.
Only in the afternoon, a firmer prelude to the US stock exchanges provided a clear direction that ultimately pushed the Dax up by 0.56% to 10 188.13 points.
The MDax averaged 0.54 percent to 19 552.88 points.
The technology-intensive TecDax rose by 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.
The EuroStoxx 50 as the eurozone's leading index advanced by 1.01 percent to 3207.60 points.
Solid profits were also recorded by trading venues in London and Paris.
In the US, the Dow Jones index last recorded around 1 percent in the plus.
Many Börsians expect that the markets will take the place until after the interest rate decision in the USA and also for the big decline on the futures exchanges on this Friday.
In the meantime, the discussion about the burdens from the nuclear phase-out has pushed the shares of RWE to a record low and left a deep mark on Eon.
According to Spiegel, German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions.
The Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat, but in the end they always lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares increased by a further 3.22 percent at the top of the Dax.
According to a dealer, a positive report from the US investor magazine "Barron's" looked like a weekend.
According to this, investors were currently paying too little attention to the German chip maker.
Investments in promising wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off.
Car values were in demand: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold again than in the same period of the previous year, as the industry association Acea announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of the car manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent respectively.
Volkswagen benefits increased by 1.26 percent.
On the German pension market, the return on circulation of listed federal securities fell to 0.48 percent (Friday: 0.50).
The pension index Rex rose by 0.12 percent to 139.55 points.
The federal future lost 0.71 percent to 154.11 points.
In the afternoon, the price of the euro fell to the last $1,1262.
Towards noon, the European Central Bank had set the reference rate at 1,1305 (1,1268) US dollars.
The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
4 people killed after police shoot rubber bullets at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of district officials, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of them throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot it in the air before she resorted to rubber bullets.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, known to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent clashes since the 10th century.
He was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The plot at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area.
A mixture of trade, trade and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market around 4000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the youth center Alte Post.
Preparations for this are currently under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mix of trade, trade and housing.
The city says they're waiting for offers.
Which investor could be considered is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already purchased part of the property on the Ringstraße / corner of Große Straße a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement at the Small Sea near Emden take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Many residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their recreational refuge
For months behind closed doors had been negotiated, pondered, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Small Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the Emder Council's Urban Development Committee.
Originally, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP faction, who accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the system construction management went on the offensive: "We don't have an answer to all the questions yet," he said to the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all rumors now.
The project, which costs around ten to twelve million euros, has been under discussion for months.
Heavy reactions among the meerbuden owners, who had come to the meeting, caused the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the Meerbuden and member of the board of the interests of the local residents, Pro Hieve, complains: "This is going to be a huge block that dominates all other buildings".
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that the planned size of the plant would greatly increase traffic: "There must come whole busloads, so that it pays off," says Schulz.
What exactly happens on the area of the former restaurant, which is a good one-hectare area, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First we must have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the development plans are still variable.
Young twins at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased about the offspring of its gorillas.
26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins has not yet been established, as Mother Dian holds them close to the body.
At first the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a broad low pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined gravure system between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches double-donations campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a doubling-donations campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations, fleeing from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeereliefe will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data will take a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has been shown to be effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18,5 and 24,9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - stomach bypass and stomach tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, BMI remained approximately the same among those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments at 29.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% completely resolved diabetes and 28% partially.
In the medical-treated group, diabetes resolved completely at only one percent and partly at only about two percent.
In addition, the results of the controls on blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "in general better in the 'surgical' group", the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastric rettomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1 % vs. 2.1 %), and experienced a more complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9 % vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people undergoing obesity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years – compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgical patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, with no increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes, which have linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love story plays in the Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently increasingly being considered in Belletristik: a young woman, unpopular and unsightly at school, meets the swarm of her youth again after years, and he falls in love with her.
This is also the case in the recently published novel "Aktually wir sind nicht so" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel is especially interesting for Hunsrück readers, as it plays in boredom and the surrounding villages.
The full-time author grew up in Borrower and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her home town.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, in the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the West European countries' response to the refugee crisis was admirable, but not appropriate to the situation.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to overcome the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It's wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions to create real peace and development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the September 11 terrorist attack, and pointed out that the US' violent response resulted in a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to resolve this problem is non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the intake of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the US report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of income from hand disinfectants in children under the age of 12 reporting poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them are going to the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectants intentionally while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Young people are said to have mixed disinfectants with alcohol - containing mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange fragrance, which are very appealing for children.
Hand disinfectants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol somewhere.
Especially in small children, few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency call centre at the University of Kansas Hospital, Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let a sip of whiskey stand around, but people leave these hand disinfectants within reach of children, and when children get to it, then it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six - year - old girl who had recently taken four splashes of strawberry - scented hand disinfectant at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice the threshold that is legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an ER doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed at her words and was unable to leave when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had her head bumped, said Ritchey.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and store hand disinfectants out of the reach of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with death.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth grade students in New York State planned to poison their "common" teacher by designing antibacterial products around the classroom," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banished her from her room.
The police regarded the foiled plan as a "swallowing" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a rear-end accident on the cross-bar between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the crossbar towards the roundabout industrial area and noticed too late that two vehicles had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he bounced his truck into the rear of an Audi and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta standing in front of it.
The vehicles involved in the accident caused material damage of about 10 000 euros, the police informs.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer ready for use and had to be towed.
Rumor kitchen: No disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the Hoops are in a bad place, but that he will turn that over again.
Hearts will fight SFA for Neilson's accusation and Warburton will be cautious about January's new commitments that could destroy the squad unit
Dons raise leadership over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's penalty in the first half of the season gave Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons could create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down talk about disharmony
There are rumors about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control, as they are preparing for confrontation with the Dutch leader in the league.
I don't think we're feeling pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutchman - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador to Ajax, said, "In Holland they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what interests them.
There is a lot of excitement in the Old Firm games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic had to fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League, the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen followed, who now stand clearly at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel that way - but we have to go on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic, because that makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton cautiously during January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, suggesting that he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious about signing new entries and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unit of the Ibrox squad.
The ex-chief of Brentford said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in summer have this preseason time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal hint
Swansea stormer Michu, in conversation with Celtic during the transfer period, indicated that he could withdraw when his contract expires with the Swans.
The 29-year-old has been struggling with an annoying ankle for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts set to SFA battle because of Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the defender's Red Card was later lifted - the third Red Card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains with what he said and insists, "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was reproved after admitting that he had sung a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the striker, adding, "It's safe to say that I won't return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United-Management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the downfall must end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We'll get the boys back on track," Donnelly said.
McInnes glad to "unbelievably win" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team desperately had to fight Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory, which earned them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything in trophy games or leagues that have not won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it rises in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as the figures of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell during the quarter to 74.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a fall in unemployment.
Drunk people interfered with the process
Since the security personnel could not settle the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the sturgeons into custody.
A breath alcohol test showed 0.89 per mille in a 16-year-old.
The adolescent was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 per mille and remained in custody at first.
Why I'm going to witness an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend, and although shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew near, I began to fear.
So why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and as there are often more applications available than seats, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Those who are chosen will watch it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wants, and you'll get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better," but she still thinks that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't even do it if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write.
When he dies, he thinks that publicity work will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the crime.
But I think there's a strong chance that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'm going to see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to.
What you're gonna get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded after wet police chase to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman stayed dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang out with the police was unsuccessful when he was in shallow and swampy water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried "to gently persuade him to return to the shore."
The Canning Vale police were called to a housebreak incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about wetting his uniform, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiates".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and threatened to end racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they were conducting a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late scratching for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt swab sample at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had held back for 18 months because of the espionage charges and did not want it to "look like too high-hanging grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get some sleep.
I want to go around raised head, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I don't, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'll have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Prior to that, Moody blew up the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Fiveteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him an employment in my stables to provide information about what I am doing within my stables," Moody said at Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly touch their noses because they failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still today.
Is that supposed to make me think it's going to be personal?
Did the RVL act cowardly and maybe blame people outside of coaches for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and break me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now makes them think about it.
But I'm now at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-term cobalt investigation at Lidari, and late scratching has led to him saying that he can "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar, described the race day treatment rule as "spicy" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which was contrary to the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my staff has mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like this last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday, whatever it was.
But it also had it on the race day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all realize that we need rules, but we've gone too far here," Moody said.
Man arrested after hit-and-run
The police arrested a man in Cobram on the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and a subsequent hit-and-run.
The cyclist was transferred by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley Highway.
The police said the driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia presented himself to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with hit-and-run and failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy backs rivals for claims to fight
Melbourne-Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his players' tacking as an "agenda setting" of two Premier League favourites of the NRL.
Sydney Rooster's coach Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed the Storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high Storm victory at the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled note about the Storm team after his team had won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "model example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of his team and said that they were only focused on their "contact" during the tackle.
Bellamy added that the criticisms of two leading coaches on his team confidently agree with him, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"This keeps popping up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have not changed anything about our defensive system or techniques, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and that has brought us the turn of the trend.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this happens again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "spanning football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he wouldn't give a shit about it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this.
I'm building stronger trust because they say these things because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when it came to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs Roosters scored a higher result than the game Broncos vs Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but what was the result? 16:12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are there breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, it's the schedules.
If they mention us, it means we're going to meet them at one stage.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the pre-final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Ticket sales start from next Tuesday morning.
Beer with $200,000 bail after drug charges
A man who may be facing a life sentence for his attempt to get possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released on a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his fellow defendants at the marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire amount and that could have been in the café for a harmless reason.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a security deposit of $200,000 to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two individuals, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under conditions that he surrendered his Australian and Serbian passports, reported to the police daily and held a curfew from 18:00 to 06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: cab breaks apart
A truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening in a rear-end accident with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked towards Basel before a permanent construction site.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to evade to the left at the last moment, as the police reported.
The driver's cab completely broke apart.
The driver was taken seriously injured to a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o'clock.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used girl phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep, lagged into an online messaging service from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages, and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers that were found at the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms for the search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to "pedophiles on the Internet" and then he "predicted to be a policeman to scare them."
Attorney Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added, "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She then saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, was guilty of taking indecent pictures of children on 14 June last year, of violating the conditions on 25 January this year, and of not having appeared in court at a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" can be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of the verdict.
Lockers avoid small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up off the major checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
For fear of discovery and arrest, many smugglers increasingly left people at smaller border crossings
out on the Austrian side, said a spokesman of the federal police.
More than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn along the Inn border river since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dams.
There they are received by federal police and forwarded for registration.
According to the Federal Police, significantly more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
By 8 a.m. alone, around 700 people arrived in the state capital, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, refugees reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Runners of tropical storm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn against storm gusts in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart reported.
The strong low was the foothills of the tropical storm "Henry", which had moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, gusts of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour can still be expected until Thursday morning in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Bodenseekreis.
On Friday the sun can be seen again longer.
The masses do it: Every two years, the car manufacturers show their new products at the IAA.
In 2015, there was particularly movement in the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand: According to the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA), this segment accounted for around 28.1 percent of new registrations in August alone.
This is also reflected in the IAA (Audience Days 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new high-class and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at the dealerships in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the trade fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
To ensure that the volume model also sells well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel offers an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hessen offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, including three-cylinder gasoline engines for the first time.
Unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door car.
The second variant will be the Kombi in spring, which is already on display at the IAA.
And besides the Astra at the IAA, what else will be driven up on new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the trade fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door in a conventional and a highly sporty GT version.
He comes to trade at the beginning of next year, then also as a station wagon.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is brand new in the segment.
The Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the design line of the brand.
The base model will have a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
The offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: The Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt, is also new in the segment.
The model is available with gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres (Nm).
Baleno's sales start in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
On the outside, the designers of the elegant Citroën fan put their hands on the front: the radiator grille was redrawn here and the changed headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was mainly modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touchscreen and Apple's CarPlay integrated for the first time.
In addition, the IAA in the compact class is joined by a series of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has justified an ex-prisoner from the Tegel Detention Centre, who has been in a too small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can even hope for money if they were confined in the too narrow rooms only a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: he was housed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space in the Berlin-Tegel prison between June and November 2009; the toilet was not separated spatially.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer, is now at large again had been transferred to a larger cell.
His civil liability lawsuit for the unworthy prison conditions against the state of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges reversed the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and dismissed the case for further examination there.
You see the human dignity of the man injured.
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of detention were relevant for the compensation of the period in question, there was a compensation claim, it was said.
Otherwise, "it would be to be feared that the legal protection of the personality will be forfeited".
The court must now settle the amount of the compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
In April, they did not give compensation to a prisoner until he was locked up naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unacceptable.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 an inhumane accommodation.
The plaintiff at that time was housed daily for three months between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case.
The Berlin prisons have also made headlines in recent weeks due to the lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly locked up for 23 hours, the aggressiveness is increasing, even fighting is said to have already occurred because of the tense situation.
According to the judicial press office, 21 posts in Tegel are not filled due to lack of young talent, 19 are to be dropped in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do this"
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What happens to Germany?
According to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accept one million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this and we can do it".
The following overview provides an overview of what is to be done in Germany.
According to different forecasts between 350000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) dwellings are used annually - for the next five years.
That's almost twice as much as it's been built to date (250000 apartments).
The lack of housing, however, is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rental properties: between 60000 and 80000 social housing units fall out of the fixed rental price every year, and refugees will also apply for these particularly favourable housing units.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
From the Pestel Institute's point of view, this is far too little: 80 000 social housing would have to be created annually and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion per year in support for this.
Scientists and Federal Minister for Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be expected to be employed in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany are not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation, criticises.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to appreciation in the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political change in Germany: from the ban on refugees to the recognition of work.
While there was previously a ban on asylum seekers to work for up to five years, in November 2014 this was reduced to three months, as was the residence requirement, which limited asylum seekers to one place of residence.
In society, the majority – also due to the shortage of skilled workers – has gained the view that refugees should be able to enter the labour market more quickly.
A major barrier to access to the labour market is the lack of German skills.
To date, there is not yet a sufficient range of general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often provided by personal contacts.
According to Thränhardt, the construction of networks is therefore the Königsweg for work integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to the day care center, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the daycare, the administration distributes leaflets in different languages.
Should the demand for educators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more technical schools.
In the countries, pupils with no knowledge of German are prepared for classes in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no state forbids asylum seekers or patients from studying - the only exception so far was Berlin, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Access to the university could be made easier for refugee students who wish to study.
After all, refugees with a residence permit or toleration will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seeker Benefit Act when they begin their studies.
In principle, the latter do not receive a Bafög, as they do not fall under the circle of the entitled persons.
Patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be entitled to Bafög, and from 1 January 2016 this range will be reduced to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, according to Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that takes professional care of the newcomers.
The rights also include obligations.
In this way, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give it certain control possibilities.
This also includes the willingness to act courageously against religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "have immediately forfeited their right to reside here, in Germany," he said on Bavarian Radio.
He suggested translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be a topic of the whole society much more than it is today.
This will also mean that the majority society will have to change, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
As a result of European decisions, Germany has had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for almost a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and non-white German interest groups have been demanding for a long time and what international agreements such as the Anti-Rassism Convention oblige Germany to do, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should use its possibilities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far, says President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"When it comes to man-power and capacity, we can do that," he told Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money had to be channelled into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls for health cards to be handed over to all arrivals at the time of registration.
Benefits received could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited service catalogue provided by the Asylum Seekers' Benefit Act.
Otherwise, especially the language barriers cause the doctors to create.
So far, as the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown, migrants are being made worse informed about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practices, interpreter costs have to be paid, she demands.
However, many refugees would also be helped with more general medical points of contact in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there were significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people were concerned with HIV education.
However, German doctors would be clear from their training with the partly other illnesses, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis is not so difficult to detect." And as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even see relief.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, many refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to be able to practise, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take further examinations.
According to estimates by the Bundespsychotherapeutenkammer (BPtK), at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill: most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatized in Germany.
If you are suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder, you will suffer from flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart beats and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe fright and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social services, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social services, mostly clerks or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misjudgements, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Leidenschaft" the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressers and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream in the manege on the brick.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior boss.
"Passion" - under this motto stands the current staging.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
The gift of enthusiasm is therefore in the blood of the family.
"It is important for us to take people away from their everyday routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours," the 27-year-old junior chief emphasizes.
"Manegencocktail with cosmopolitan flair," says Director Reinhard Probst, calling his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 kilometre long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of silent films, the Cuban duo wants to record it loosely.
Lightness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women's hearts by storm.
In addition to numerous salmon alves, the acrobatics of Circus Probst also fascinate with touch and articulation.
Balance with the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snakemen fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinates with her mobility.
Sixty employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," emphasises Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Mistakes in the attitude of circus animals are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also comments on this: "If our animals are not doing well, we are not doing well either".
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each petting unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are read from the eyes whenever possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to get into the cage.
So the top priority is to take good care of the animals.
The Probst family is particularly proud of her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare.
The two animals lived together in a enclosure for eight years and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the Manege, but it is the unique mascot of Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether it's five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are there with all our heart."
From September 17th to 20th, Circus Probst invites you to his performances every day at 5 and 8 pm.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 and 16 o'clock.
Thursday is family day, prices are reduced for the show at 5 pm.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe makes false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case spread quickly through the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also clouded by claims by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with booze calls.
Last month they booed him out and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesman Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them not to interfere with Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he said to journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members of Parliament concerned that immunity in Parliament ends and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and saving efforts in the company's services.
HP will later this year split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast-growing enterprise hardware and service business.
The expected job reduction will result in a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and deeper portfolio of businesses that support companies in moving to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and "will be focused on delivering unmatched, integrated technology solutions to businesses," says a statement from the company.
It splits up a company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical systems and whose Palo Alto garage was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US-tech companies, is the latest in this field, based on the belief that closely focused companies deliver better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand in front of the match against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is as planned, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and given its history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is surely still uncertain.
The big shame with this current problem is that Wilshere had finished the last season hard after a separate ankle injury and then found his way back to his old swing during the preseason.
"This kind of injury does not threaten your career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
It's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It wasn't related to his ankles or the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league matches in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08, they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded the most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period of time, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he'll do it and he'll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal will start its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger will have a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta could start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give the players who need a little breather," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to move forward through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is undefeated even after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn lessons from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It's never worked out at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I am in business long enough to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in view of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and remains three times more common for men than for women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of Man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge.
A recent study among more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends first, so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media-led communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, jovial and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values – our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments of watching football in comfortable armchairs, and Ross' longing for Rachel – all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it, even if they are often reluctant to fully explore their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone chaplain explained to me, "my listening role for people who feel depressed and are suicidal has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I get along with it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you're going to come to Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with a completely new setting to celebrate the day, why don't you take your friends to a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG pass Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria hit less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who got the French champion on the way, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before she finally increased her lead when Cavani scored a headball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they not only aim for the qualification for the knockout rounds, but also an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn’t a class match of Laurent Blanc’s team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances before the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career already in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League, so it’s a good start to win 2:0, to cause problems for our opponents and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still have to perfect during the season,” Blanc said.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn't score one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes, which was able to hold a 2:2 draw on his own against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was stabbed out in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing stormer was called the man who could take PSG to the next level in Europe when it was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted why when he walked into Marco Beträtti's Pass behind the Malmö defense, before passing Johan Wiland, he nicely ended up in the long corner of the net.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a playoff to reach this level, competed with nine national players in the field at Anpiff and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two low in the midfield.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far past Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG gave up on itself sometimes, with some failures and bad degrees, not least by Ibrahimovic, who in no less than five attempts paws alone in the first half and was then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play, and it was a pass of Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a shooting shot, which was guided by Wiland in the 52nd minute by the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan scored his sixth season goal after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thought that Malmö could come back to the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi was finally denied a goal.
Malmö's coach, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League match was last December.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough."
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through share sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, affected by collapsing commodity prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt redemption plan.
Glencore, a company registered in London, said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China's economic downturn pushes demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought Glencore's share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange on early Wednesday morning.
The stock jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced last week the $2.5 billion share sale as part of the broader plans to repay around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shareholdings at 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other raw material prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and responds to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, said the statement.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state diner this evening, after bilateral talks between the two leaders.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disagreement in a constructive manner," adds the statement.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to raise a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and growing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
440 hp sports car borrowed and driven to scrap
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rain-wet highway came the bad awakening.
At a company in the district of Gotha you can fulfill your dream and rent and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
So did a 29-year-old from the district of Gotha.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt the dream was over and out.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, got into a sling on wet roads and drove into the guardrail.
The sports car suffered total damage, nobody was injured.
The property damage is estimated at 40,000 EUR.
Xavier: Pep Guardiola prevented a change to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European Champion Xavier has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern was obviously close to the commitment of Spain's superstar Xavier, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight Spanish Champions, three Cup Winners, four Champions League Winners, two Club World Champions, two European Champions, one World Champion - the title list of Xavier is breathtaking.
In the summer, he left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
However, in an interview with Marca, Xavier now reveals that he was already standing before the 2008 European Championships before leaving Barcelona.
"They told me Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, we won nothing," he says.
FC Bayern also registered this.
Xavier: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
As a reminder, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern in the summer of 2008.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavier did not change
However, the change did not come about.
And the decisive man for this is now working for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavier explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bavaria's 2008/2009 season would have been with Xavier.
In the quarterfinals of the Champions League, Xavier stood on the lawn for Barca against the Bavarians over the entire distance, turned off the Reds (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the King Class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a series of Sunday Nights by HBO's Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the selected script of the project.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it when you cast the film and not when you cast the show," said Damon.
Brown reacted shocked with insulted unbelief and shouted "Hoo! Wow. Okay" when the comments of the actor of The Martian strengthened.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I would like to ask people to think about - whoever the director will be - how they treat the character of Harmony," Brown said at first.
The only black person, and she's a hooker beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People worked for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing rights to the film; Damon replied that her director "in the end could give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was aired, the social media exploded from disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger about the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO KNOWING that it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer, the Black Lives Matter movement had a nationwide impact and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against color.
In February, singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox news personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck as to whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sports climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a contest participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the finale.
The last task was climbing a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within time, making him the first athlete to complete American Ninja Warrior’s exhausting phase 4. However, Caldiero finished this challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E! News after the hard-won victory, still under the shock of winning the $1 million Grand Prize.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," Isaac E! said about his pile of money.
All of a sudden .. I can't even imagine what that's like... the future is unknown.
Leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finals and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course at all, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it will get the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and changes life, he gets the great congratulations.
I don't think he has any grudge about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received masses of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone beats me, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had switched roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, the shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaking past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season wasn't very funny for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within a half of the Houston Astros for second American League Wildcard place.
For Detroit, though only for one night, it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tiger's manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit the 1/3 innings six times and made three runs possible.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end strongly this year," Simon said.
It's hard to throw any game in the bullpen, and so I want to go into the game in a very focused way.
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He did a good swing," said Ausmus.
He looked good in the (strike training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he put it straight into the game.
With three runs behind at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double at the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a Bunt, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overcame Wall, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designated Rookie striker Miguel Sano, who snatched a two-run from right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final run in the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League that Plouffe beat a double play this season
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Mauer made an RBI double against the Closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and scored the 5-4 position.
The right-handed man, however, stood out Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
At the start of the game, Detroit benefited from an unmovable Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been removed from the injured list before the game after missing more than a month due to a back injury.
"Obviously not the beginning I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler after they received the leadoff batter in the first.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into play, who made a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 successful series with the runners in scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, creating another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers increased in the second, scored a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center-Fielder Anthony Gose to the 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't do very well, but he got the right job.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reliever right-winger A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez retired due to an injury to the litter shoulder.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August because of a shoulder injury, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30th
He's been missing since August 20 because of a distortion in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who arrived in Wiesbaden will then be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She expected 450 to 750 refugees to arrive.
Several sports halls of the Hessian state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They are then to be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to information provided by the government bureau responsible for the first admission, Gießen, 7500 people had arrived in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be an opportunity.
"I believe that decisive reflection on military options for action must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective looking away".
Four years ago, one was glad that the cup of military participation passed Germany.
"Now the conflict is crashing on our doorstep," he said on Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening on the Austrian TV channel ORF that no one would be sent back to Hungary.
Germany also did not send any refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement whereby Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany in this regard.
She did not mention any specific figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday.
In recent days tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their destination is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have not yet been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
The EU Interior Ministers intend to make a new effort at a special meeting next Tuesday (22 September) to make a binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees.
In view of the strong influx of refugees in Germany, the federal government wants to support the countries more strongly in the initial reception and distribution of the people.
The federal government will manage this together with the Länder, Merkel announced on late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the prime ministers in the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection would also get it.
But those who have no prospect of staying can't stay in Germany either.
This view had been strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a "great effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-kilometer-long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU unlike Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from seeking alternative routes via Romania, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
Meanwhile, according to eyewitness reports, thousands of more migrants set off for the Greek border in Turkey.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturn moon Enceladus
Under the ice armor of Saturn's moon Enceladus, a global ocean floats.
This is the conclusion of researchers from observations of the Cassini spacecraft.
According to this, the moon is slightly tumbling around the ring planet on its orbit.
This tumbling movement is only small, but still too large for a solid celestial body, according to a message from Cornell University in Ithaca (US state New York) of Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
For a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice sheet of Enceladus.
In 2006, "Cassini" had discovered ice volcanoes at the southern pole of Saturn's moon, which feed water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called e-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there had to be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to do without Offensivakter Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation revealed an adductor injury to the 27-year-old, the association informed.
Rama had already complained of pain at the beginning of the week.
According to the Munich Lions, the diagnosis means "presumably four weeks of forced rest".
"It's hard for us, Rama is a bitter loss."
"Of course we need to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "Image" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an unaffiliated professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously signed by VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croat currently has "the opportunity to prove his skills".
Goal Hunter Rubin Okotie can return to team training after his concussion next week.
The Austrian national player should start running training already on Thursday.
Okotie had injured himself in the match at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent collision on his head.
Contrary to initial fears, however, he remained without a serious blessing.
No Diet Fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But he who wants to watch his slender line is often advised against it.
Because mangoes contain quite a lot of sugar - especially sucrose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasantly smell.
The skin color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet foods.
A mango also gives a special touch to hearty dishes.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicory and radiccio.
And a mangochutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The US parcel service UPS again hires up to 95000 helpers for the Christmas business in the USA.
The company had already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
Drivers in particular are sought after.
Last year UPS had already increased its workforce by 95000 allowances for the holiday season.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making early arrangements to be prepared for the Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First Föhnsturm, then striking cold front
In the coming night, the valleys of the Alpine north side of the Föhn break through, according to Meteoschweiz on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the hair dryer blows partly with storm strength through the hair dryer valleys.
After the blow-off on Thursday morning, a striking cold front crosses us, bringing strong rainfall, wind gusts and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area across the British Isles in a strong southwesterly current.
On the north side of the Alps, the Föhn breaks through the valleys on Wednesday night.
In the following, the hair dryer blows until Thursday morning in the Föhntäler with gusts from 60 to 100 km/h, occasionally and especially in the Urnerland partly also with over 100 km/h.
The Föhn can sometimes reach the neighbouring central country, and on the mountains even hurricane gusts of over 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy Föhn provides summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity begins to stagnate on the southern slope of the Alps.
Here comes rain, which lasts until Thursday night.
In total, over 100 litres of rain per square meter have to be expected south of the Alps in the next 48 hours, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last days.
On Thursday morning, the Föhn runs out of air, followed by a cold front with strong, partly witty rain from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and temperatures fall significantly.
The following days present themselves in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, but in the south it becomes more sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on Wednesday in the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now recognized as a "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome, next to the Colosseum.
The name had been applied for by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the Popes could live their faith for centuries as a minority often only in secret.
With the square it became symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith was welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a young Augustinian monk in Rome at the turn of the year 1510/11.
At that time, he felt that the city was a depraved bible of sin.
His negative impressions may have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome, according to historians.
Luther then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the indulgence trade.
Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar Old Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
At the beginning was the painting for Otmar Alt, who formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
The 75-year-old has preserved his "language" with colorful colours and imaginative shapes - which is by no means synonymous with "funny" images.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can seem rather bleak.
For about three years Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many topics of the "Book of All Books".
Cycles have been created that address topics such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, commandments or the Lord's Prayer.
With this, he spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into today, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's painting.
They are embedded between the original biblical quotation by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old doubles a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
"That's where the upbringing happened with the cane," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I tried to work this out, perhaps to get along with the Father again."
His second concern is to help art regain its importance in a fast-paced time: "The perception of image worlds is today marked by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is being supplanted.
Artists have a different desire and delight to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "enter" the images, let them work on themselves, discover and feel the power they have: "The image seeks its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible in the Otmar Alt Foundation that he had "always" been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his paintings".
Alt did not pay attention to fully grasping the Bible, but chose the subjects that were important to him, including mysterious ones.
"This was not a cooperation on an equal footing," says Altepost: "This is about the images, the text merely explains."
For Hans Möhler from Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and responsibility.
Part of the originals – paper and canvas paintings – will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened at the Otmar Alt Foundation on 15 November.
Start of construction for BMX-Bahn nears
Plans made, space found, companies commissioned, earth hills modeled for a circuit: one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX-Bahn was already finished.
Failures in politics and administration caused confusion, especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hill deported, new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The first municipal councilwoman Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now report the approval to the Children's and Youth Committee.
"I hope something visible will happen this year," she said.
Work at the former indoor pool should then be started without a "further memorial break".
DFB intensifyes its commitment to refugees
The DFB is extending its commitment to refugees until 2019; the Bundesliga is sending a clear signal on the weekend.
Football responds to the growing situation in Germany and assures policy makers its help in tackling the problems ahead.
"I consider this to be our country's greatest challenge since reunification."
"In principle, nobody can say that it's none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
"This must interest everyone to get this topic under control," said DFB CEO Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I will be in the Chancellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State, Ms Özoğuz, and the Chancellor."
"The topic will certainly play a central role," he announced.
Football can and wants to help.
But politics must set the decisive course.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," said Niersbach at the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some Bundesliga players also support this program.
Already this weekend the 36 professional clubs set a clear signal when they will wear the imprint "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," said Leverkusen's head of sports Rudi Völler of the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as "of course".
"The refugee drama goes to everyone, no one can look away."
"We German football leagues can, no, we must use our radiance, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
The national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the European Championship qualification match against Hungary on this Friday.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great joint effort of German football".
The fact that all 36 licensing associations have started their own projects in their places is great.
Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" we have given is lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this and next year, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will each provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called up the whole amount for 2015", reported Niersbach.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in the event of an accident
The CEO of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, reportedly lost his left eye in a crash in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the USA he fell on a water glass after midnight, which he had carried in his left hand, reported the "Wirtschaftswoche" on Wednesday.
"He almost bled to death, passed out, then dragged himself out into the street - he told us so last week," quotes "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October, we meet in Walldorf before the Supervisory Board meeting," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully capable of working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he would come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman, Hasso Plattner," said McDermott of the "SZ."
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he has not been at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
To him it is important to go public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Anyone can have such a thing."
"It's important to get up again when you fall."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of action...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
Therefore, at the night race in Singapore on the weekend, he is no longer a reserve driver for the two regular pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as well as a week later at the Japan Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group match of the Europa League finally broke.
The national player will also be missing in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 a.m./Sky).
"Unfortunately, we cannot rely on him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect him to return to training on Friday".
In view of the high workload of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his regular elf on the Reus position.
So he announced a change on the goalkeeper position.
Therefore Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, Tuchel left open whether Weidenfeller would be used in all Europe League games in the future.
He will most likely also contest the second game.
The bold statement of fellow player Reus that the final move for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, midfielder Julian Weigl thinks comprehensible: "This is not so wrong for Marco."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robotic cars: Government wants to lead the way for Germany
According to the Federal Government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA car fair about a "new mobility age".
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and reduce congestion, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who also meet industry representatives at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently being developed on motorway 9 in Bavaria.
In order to ensure that the driver "does not face additional liability risks", the Federal Government wants to "check the legal framework conditions and adapt them where necessary to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the permissible maximum speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km/h.
The Federal Government also wants to promote an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, and the driver is becoming more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "to be expected far after 2020".
The authors of the study estimate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the German site to be around 8.4 billion euros for 2025.
"The digital connectivity of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic," said Sören Bartol, a SPD transport politician.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of drivers' personal data had to be clarified clearly.
Yet the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organisation Dekra, which was presented at the AA on Wednesday, concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect this in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of the respondents expect cars to drive autonomously by 2025, while in the USA, 33 percent expect cars to drive autonomously by 2025.
In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to hand over control throughout the journey on all roads.
On the motorway, this could be 15 percent in running traffic, 45 percent in traffic jams.
Well, every fourth would not leave the car to control under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis-EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to play only in singles according to current status in the title fights from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision is to be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to win the title without Timo," said Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
At that time Boll was on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsoring date in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite," said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the set list in Yekaterinburg, also reminded of the European Championship 2013 in Schwechat.
"When Timo was missing, too, and we became European champions."
"We should orient ourselves to this," explained the world rankings fifth.
The English national football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to the right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit in a tackle by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis pointed to a shin fracture in Bastian Schweinsteiger's 20-year-old fellow player.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant Terrible
It is a mixture of a huge fashion show and a wax-figure grueling cabinet: designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: mannequins that look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and so that he put men in skirts.
"I can no longer say that I am the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair."
"It used to be bleached, now it's real," Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), which will be shown in the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung from September 18th, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously made stops in Montreal, Canada, and Paris.
"It's all about so much more than beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographed overall work of art, for which a lot of effort was carried out: For example, a stylist was dedicated to dressing the dolls.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material have been cast into Munich by the makers.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special treat: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and in people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer's first, timid, fashionable attempts to walk.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he dressed his teddy bras and clothes, Gaultier said.
Playing with a doll would not have allowed his parents to play with him.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later I bought them, of course.
He couldn't pay the models for his first fashion show.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep their clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtains - Plauener lace as fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen were about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers who, for example, processed them into blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of the fashion tip Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauen peak, fashion played a larger role, was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: lace in jewellery, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past stylistic epochs, creates an increasing order potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Together with nine other companies, Fashionspitze Plauen is a member of the Plauener Spitz and Embroidery Association.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have broken away.
There are almost no more private specialist shops and also the wholesale trade.
Our products hardly reach the customers in this way.
Today, mass goods are produced much cheaper in Asia and almost exclusively sold through chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the USA.
Sufficient reasons for new paths.
The industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have held a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible products".
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diplomdesigner Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger branch office of the West Saxony University of Applied Arts Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian region, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies, which have to think primarily economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
The machine embroiders small balls in some places.
The Plauen goldsmith master Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before that, I couldn't do anything with traditional Plauen lace."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Spitz - young and old," says Reuter.
It also supplies to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a souvenir.
I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Plauen lace.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends should not be touched, but Disney dares to make a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, this is not about a remake, but about a kind of sequel that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It's about the nanny's experience with the Banks family in times of the Great Depression in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges the wider opening of the economy to the world
The economy needs to open up more outwardly in order to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday to a group tasked with steering the reform.
"China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and advancing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, said Xi.
The leadership group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list to regulate market access, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital, and overhaul of the population reporting system.
After the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures a rule-of-law business environment and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also ease controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open up government-controlled sectors, further areas will be opened up to private investment.
"The government will not change its foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to carry out their duties and to appoint professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and thus give consumers a significantly higher dose of neurotoxicity.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding working paper from the EU, strongly criticised the plans: "Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant women and young children with full force," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of neurotoxicity for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily burdened with mercury that, on the basis of the remaining limits, about 50 percent of catches cannot be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
In return for this relaxation, the EU wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram, according to Foodwatch.
However, Foodwatch described this as a "trick" because smaller ceremonial fish, such as carp, are usually so low loaded that they already comply with the planned maximum values today.
The lowering of small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversion that only helps the economy," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans, which accumulates over the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn people".
The Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage, however, with regard to the current maximum values, that a "health risk to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through coal combustion.
According to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry, the German coal power plants emit more than six tons of mercury per year to the Greens' parliament member Annalena Baerbock, two thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube, was "persistently and comprehensively exceeded", the "mirror" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU RASFF warning system.
