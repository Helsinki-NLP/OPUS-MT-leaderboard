The main task of the kings was to build a tomb of which one thought it would seem as timeless as the stars above the sand of the time, in which everything else sank. The planning of the afterlife was more important than life itself, which was only the way to it. Wars led them to remember the walls of this tomb, in whose stone the scenes were carved, gloriously. Of course, much was embellished, and in later times even battles, which had not taken place at all, were depicted.
