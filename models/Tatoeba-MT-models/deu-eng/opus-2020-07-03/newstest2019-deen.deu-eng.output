Nevertheless, the nine "Beautiful Munich Candidates" deliver off and defy wind, spray and rain like real professionals while shooting with people photographer Tuan.
The romantic shooting is available in the video:
DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that you get into conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as it was stated in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite the months-long debate about the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-times national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed that it would be so until a certain point in time," said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and had also justified him by the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build up pressure, but he knows it from football that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation hasn't come about so far".
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 2:13 p.m., the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was in delay.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire at the arrival.
The roof had to be removed practically completely and fire debris had to be removed to the absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had plugged a battery to the store at noon.
This could possibly be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the range of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the open street
What has led Lindsay Lohan to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to tear the children away from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself streamed live, as she apparently wants to tear the children away from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants to have as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults of trafficking in children.
She doesn't provide any evidence for all of this in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this right now," Lohan can be heard in the video following the family along the road.
Apparently, she's trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she's turning around and giving Lohan a slap.
With tears, the actress insists on how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What has led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is supposed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign tickers: number of deaths on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 fatalities have been reported.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated the devastated and cut off areas from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Chairman of the Supervisory Board
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused turmoil in the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletroautobauer.
The U.S. stock exchange court sued him for fraud, but now both have reached an agreement.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he may remain CEO.
British Conservative Party Congress
Sharply guarded - the Party Congress of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The congress is about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these names for years.
Now they've come to an agreement.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population is voting on this Sunday - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" - meant Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate and is thus in the lead in the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer, to the industry journal "Automobilwoche".
In December 2017, Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, who was imprisoned and on leave of absence, announced that the task force would soon be disbanded.
"All engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested in the first quarter of 2018," he said at the time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in the process of reassessing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer had made "significant organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wants to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities accuse the Audi chief of having approved the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust values after the announcement of the exhaust fraud.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Bram Schot, Chief Sales Officer, heads the company as acting CEO.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, Schot said the "Heilbronner Stimme".
In principle, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel aims to re-election - Lahm is to be elected to the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup off and the Özil affair, Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for office as DFB President next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" on early Sunday morning.
You have to keep trying to re-election, I'll do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the president of the association would find it "remarkable" if he did not "have the desire to work on the future project" after the contract for the football-EM 2024.
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as the successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who has fallen over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB-Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM Chief Organiser Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to consult the Bureau in this role and would of course be cordially invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," said Grindel.
In speculations whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migrant background should become DFB's integration ambassador.
Currently, this office is held by the Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football and says, "the issue is important, we have to take care of it," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration must work," said Grindel.
Decrease correctly with half-wise scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat content.
Muscle and bone mass can also indicate it.
The thing also calculates the body mass index, but it's more for the sausages.
Doesn't he say anything about whether I've replaced fat with muscle?
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena the runner-up easily won with 112:55 (52:31) and offered over 40 minutes a convincing match.
New entry Rokas Giedraitis was with 20 points top scorer of the dominant Berliner.
The international player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators in his debut.
Ex-master Brose Bamberg won the compulsory match debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
With 24 points, Augustine Rubit was the best thrower at the guests.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.
Last year's playoff semi finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the most effective shooter in the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the Basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings surpassed the Oldenburgs with 25 counters.
The Braunschweigers, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 race of the Baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to hand over supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, Cologne's city centre had been partially blocked.
Several thousand police officers were in action - among them also snipers.
The Islamic Association of Ditib is critical because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Scarksecond
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted more commitment to the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Commit wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of around 600.000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here, ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations, also appeared on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a second of horror when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was shots, scared and tried to escape.
In short, panic arose, people ran confused.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and the musician Chris Martin calmed people down from the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You're all safe.
As every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet.
Anyone who wanted to get one had to read and share texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - buhrufe, on the other hand, for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He spoke together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke out in the U.S. Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, pushing many women to the head.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape of Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who according to their own data had themselves experienced sexual assault, confronted him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also meet me in an elevator at any time," Flake said to the crowd at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends the journalist's expulsion
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put over a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, Seibert told the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disruption of the press conference.
The journalist's action had caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
That's why he ordered personal protectors to take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities either: Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was only arrested at the beginning of September.
Recently, the cases of the detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but there are still trials against the two in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz totally drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for its moist-filled conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller and her guests come across a lot of beer, some wine or even higher-percent drinks to ease the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also take courage for the obligatory vocal arrangements.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Horniest Day".
But the Municher didn't get the trip to the far north at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely sucked on it, the eyes only two small slits left.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's just got a powerful hangover.
Directed to his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER goes to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And the round of eggnogs that Ina throws at half past three, let go too.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips on how to fight the blows.
They ranged from instant broth, fish buns or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
How Ina Müller survived the nocturnal riot is not yet known.
But since she has been hosting the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and filth
The entry into the 36-kilometer-long railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and waste.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Shards, cigarette dumps, garbage and rubbish, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the flagship railway bike path in the Red Riding Hoodland a more than inglorious sight.
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also by others for a long time, according to the bicycle transport officer of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the Radverkehrsbeirat.
There was no solution yet.
The proposals ranged from the installation of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the command of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also contributed the topic to the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
It is not only often done loudly, but also destroyed in the clutches: posts are torn out of the ground, trash can is demolished, signs are bent over, seat furniture is smeared.
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions were only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting point for drinking.
"The main focus is clearly on the Haaße hill along the entire cycle path," confirms the bicycle traffic officer, who is now also concerned about the new cycle site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "It may set the threshold significantly higher to attack commons.
However, this would require a police patrol to arrive in time.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße hill.
He needed to be made more attractive.
One could be very satisfied with the frequenting of the cycle path so far.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high quality compared to others in Germany", says the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no turning track on the Haaße hill.
If traffic is brisk, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for older drivers and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for a music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Musikcontest für große und kleine, jünde und erfahrente Musiken".
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family gathering with coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the cultural station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-time albattener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
According to District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, this contest is a novelty.
We have not experienced this in other parts of the city.
What did the copywriters see in connection with?
Lake Hiltruper and Marktallee were most often mentioned in the villages.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit-like song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
Time and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
Humberg learned that he had actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
From sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann Franke knew to report that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed a lot on YouTube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper Gastronomy.
Nevertheless, there was something special for the favourites of the jury - so that others can listen to their songs.
An entire CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Hemig with his Hiltrup drummer, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tolle.
Like all of them, the children performed again for the finale - and even sounded "real good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchyness of melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its 10th anniversary.
She rated the event as a complete success.
Everyone is "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in it there are four cards with keywords, which you can decipher - the old trick with the red slide - only after you have put them in.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read anything by mistake.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
Second window.
Three dice.
4. Fest".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
Because here we should guess not the terms, but codes.
Alternate one player per team is the encrypter.
He gets a code card that might say "3.4.2. "
In "Decrypto", it is not the terms behind the secret foil that are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: In this order and in this example, he should describe the terms "cube", "fix" and "window" in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible does not; because this wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encrypter notes and reads out loud: "Throw" for the dice, "Lose" as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like "party" would also be possible and "Prague" because he was paying attention at school and knows the window collapse there.
So it goes round by round, team by team on.
One does not know the terms of the opposite side - but it can be better combined with any clue given by the encrypter there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, the transcriptions should be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic of "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you get started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling you have in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessors and genre-primus "Codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game of fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if it's just about guessing and not about winning points, it's also easy to find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harassed guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection of Kulmbach twice the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler salute in the Upper City of a passing police patrol, later he also appeared in a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized by the police, he had to spend the night in the prison cell at the police inspection in Kulmbach.
In a sober state, he then has to answer for the use of marks of unconstitutional organizations.
Works Pressig was home to the Schubloks
The railway works in Pressig were the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers popped at buffers, it was heard all over Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archived the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes squeaked and the wagons squeaked.
That was just a railroad.
Statements that are symbolic of Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramps to the north, which after an ascent of about 220 meters of altitude has its vertex in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, train and push locomotives were needed in the past, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway depot with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, overhead line and railway master shop.
"The heartpiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional railways.
From the railway depot (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben were also operated.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160; 13 steam locomotives and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and thrust locomotives.
From 1977 onwards, they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 weighings were still ranked per month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were demolished, and in 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we have not considered better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport."
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" a pompous station festival in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
Just a little bit later, we're off.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, while the marshalling station Pressig was history.
"The shunters and inhibitors did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why Pressig-Rothenkirchen station has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have already reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing like Julia Görges did before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kasachsten or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Sieggemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darya Kassatkina, when the Russian put at number 13 gave up.
The Schwäbin is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Pleasure", a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach on the weekend.
With great relief registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the special opening "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the property Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourist association "Rund ums Walberla" in the context of the series "Art and Pleasure".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition was shown by a large number of visitors.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the opening.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
A little surprising, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have been involved in designing flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is again a 70 cent special stamp, which they designed, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical framing.
When walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with coloured accents.
Already at the entrance of the property the visitor awaits on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully provided with 20 wind wheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object looks magically sunken and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers in three-dimensional letters to devote himself to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts in motion in the wind.
On half-way, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians also gave air to their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more Sangesleben in the district.
It has become a legend by now: At a bank in the Tinnenbusch they took the MGV 68 Albachten out of the christening.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter".
"It's going to be full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
150 guests were there, a real success for the Albachten singers.
On their own occasion, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
On time for the 50th anniversary the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it was asked for festive clothing had been previously.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Encounter", but comfortably at tables.
In between there was movement: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the controls and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honor that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten let the voice sound themselves.
To the occasion, cheerful songs were announced.
Almost already set: "Such a day, as beautiful as today".
Matching to the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheimer wine".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hop".
Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time, was once again sovereign in the choir.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said: "He has such an easy way, it's a masterpiece he performs." Incidentally, this time not only men presented themselves vocally.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire includes especially Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a big raffle.
The proceeds are intended to finance a visit to the Allwetterzoo to the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The ascender is marching.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is really well suited in league three.
No sign of shyness or freckles, the independents do their thing.
And this at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we already made an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring this to the finish line, such a game can tip," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full yield to the finish.
"We are all aware of who is on the other side of such a derby.
That doesn't break our necks.
I have seen really good volleyball in stages," Annacker did not argue with the 0:3 - and immediately went on to the agenda.
Where the journey for the independents is going, seems not foreseeable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball." In the fourth league they don't want to turn their gaze downwards anyway.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they have to look up.
However, a first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will arrive in Essen on 14 October.

With the fans, of course, you are already thinking about a successor.
While Didi Kühbauer is considered a favorite, some fans prove humor.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dreamship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series could have had a complicity in her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chief Hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "dreamship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left the ship forever.
The series, which made her a star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she had been married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason, too.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world with a suitcase alone and many colleagues I admired noticed me at eye level," Keller tells in conversation with the "Picture on Sunday".
At first she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"He liked it so much, I don't know."
She considers it possible that her husband at the time might have been quite envious, but "how many men did Hans shy of talking about problems and feelings."
Keller always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have disguised myself", as she explains further.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw me as an emancipated woman, who I was never really, even though I sometimes appeared bold and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding, I sat in the dressing room crying and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody also failed.
Why didn't it ever work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I've approached love way too naively."
The moth, who regularly explores the city's nightlife at the NZZ resort in Zurich, has this time ventured into the ZFF opening party.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little shy.
And the glaring shine in which a green carpet is dipped on the six-blade square blinds it overly.
But it's just a film festival, where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
On this late Thursday evening, he stumbles over the square in order to facilitate himself briefly in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase".
This is what the public toilet system, sponsored by a large sanitary company, is called, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The emergency facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, the Lord's oasis stinks to heaven for some reason.
So get out here, over to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who entertained at the cinema next door to the opening film "Green Book" just at the best level, celebrate the festival start with a party in the three-storey department store just like every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: The works shown are from the whole globe.
What you don't have to think of in an article about this festival, in order not to fall for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a small volume around the feelers, which has a good fairy attached to it, and two bully bouncers actually wave him in in a generous way.
Inside, the invited crowds rush, dance to live music long after midnight, or let DJ rhythms sing to each other, and flush exquisite appetizers with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement oysters wait for slurping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain sprouts.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared out for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The moth studies the sign at the escalator: "Carry a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If that's two separate instructions, he's lost his way in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it's certainly already saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry tilts a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who's been promoting that brand for years, isn't here that night either.
But there, between local celebrities, cash desks and kitchen items, a face that appears to the observer is passing: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His leading actor shouldn't be far.
And really: Viggo Mortensen is walking through the crowd with almost sixty almost like a choirboy.
They don't talk to him, they don't look at him, they just steal it.
Especially for this restraint, which is often misunderstood as entanglement, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is pleased about the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to cumbia rhythms, as can be seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, cheered by the players.
On Saturday, the Mexican runner-up defeated the Leones Negros with 2-0.
After the game, Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Sending after last minute break "destructed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball club ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His protégés were "destructed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - broke - the fourth in the fourth match - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long periods, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we totally overslept", the ASV trainer got annoyed.
The owners of the house quickly led with 8:1, even the early time out, which Bieletzki had taken, at first did not bear fruit.
"But then suddenly a jerk went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
For the break, the gap was only two goals.
Especially Sending's best, Marius Hintze, hit the stage once and for all.
After the change, it got even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst balanced out at 15:15, then the relay changer led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly soothing three hits (29:26).
And then?
Engage the impartials in the action.
Bieletzki usually avoids finding fault with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff collected was "a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and hit four times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood up against seven men in the back and threw again and again at the empty goal.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come here," said Bieletzki.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - Police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old woman from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the woman's remains.
On Saturday, forces dug up a street near Marxgrün.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers below were removed, as the police and prosecutors shared.
According to recent findings, the missing person may have been buried not far from their place of residence at that time.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
Investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working intensively on the case together with the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators encountered a remarkable under the road near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials bordered the spot a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers are lurking on the net.

Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his impending dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the US stock exchange supervisor SEC filed an out-of-court lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay 20 million dollars each, and Musk also gives up the position of Chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
He may remain the chairman of the board.
In the settlement, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who is also head of SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He had always acted in the spirit of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock market, paying 420 dollars per share, the financing being secured.
Tesla would have been valued at a total of $72 billion.
Later Musk rowed back: Tesla remained on the stock exchange.
Following the agreement, Tesla now needs to find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication.

After the worst start of the season since 1989, record champion Manchester United has slipped deeper and deeper into the crisis.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United with 1:3 (0:2) and remains only in the middle of the league with ten points after seven days.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow in front of the Champions League match against Valencia FC on Tuesday.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno came to his first Premier League mission after an injury to Petr Cech.

Surveys: 46 percent don't want Merkel to be chancellor by 2021
After the scrambles of recent weeks, the GroKo collects several survey lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in an interview - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture nationwide for the first time on Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by a counter to 17 percent, the SPD scores a point compared to the previous week and ends up at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union in the Sunday trend so far.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
According to Emnid, if Bundestag elections were to take place on Sunday, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the votes together.
This means that the grand coalition has currently lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently come to 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election, they received a total of 53.4 percent.
Among the other parties, the range is also large: the AfD, the second strongest party in several polls, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens achieve votes of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, FDP 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the vote.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
At present, only 48 percent of the citizens still find that Merkel is the right one in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wants the grand coalition to hold in three years until the next regular Bundestag election, 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
A further survey published on Saturday also showed a marked loss of popularity for Merkel.
Divided, the Germans also assess whether Merkel should run again for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, while 44 percent are in favour.
64 per cent of the Union's supporters want candidacy, 35 per cent do not.
Hang out at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" through Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a place to get to know for the great love almost exudes an anachronistic romanticism.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short bargain at the volley table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tinder stands in the reputation to be less a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We ventured the test: how do women react, you don't talk around the bush long in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
Rule-right Hollywood-Lovestory potential has it when the happiness of love precedes an out-of-the-eye lost-and-found plot.
If the guy calls his worshippers under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and co-owner - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this advertisement in an unknown Aldi branch to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she has briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat".
She definitely deserves her happy ending à la Hollywood for believing in the magic of getting to know analogues.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has been participating in the action "Deckel gegen Polio - 500 Lid für eine Leben ohne poliolämung".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease called polio in German leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany polio is considered to be eradicated, but there are still three countries around the world where the disease occurs.
So far, the cause of poliomyelitis, polioviruses, can only be contained by vaccinations, as a press release says.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about form and fitness by Mario Götze.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That doesn't do the boy any good.
And that doesn't do us any good," said Reus, a friend of Götze, after the 4-2 win in Leverkusen at the TV station Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry during contractual talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the Bundesliga football team Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no hurry with a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We haven't even talked about a treaty yet.
There's no fixed date when we do this.
"There will certainly be the moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl said on Sunday evening on the TV channel Sky.
Football: Bezirksliga: Researcher appearance of VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this young season, when Alois Fetsch went to court with his own.
Wortkarg, the coach of VfL Wolbeck, withdrew (innerly) in order to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
It's all history.
In the meantime it runs again round the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer proof is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only very thinly broken past the ascent.
Yes, I'm very pleased with the performance.
"We narrowed down the rooms and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and went to every individual after the match to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg came - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly over into a 4-2-3 in which Niklas Thewes waited in the front line for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more play shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
This almost took revenge when the SCA hit dangerously in front of the Wolbecker Kasten in Minute 41 twice in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed scarcely.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes of a Thewes input.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left side missed another fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the Platzherden 18 meters in front of the guest housing.
The fouled entered himself and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right flap hit bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
20 more minutes that should be damn long.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather to his hand in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
In the final phase, Wolbeck had to survive anxious minutes before Geske had the victory hit on the puss in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Might have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
At the landing there was an accident on the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
At about 2 p.m. on Sunday at the airfield in Kottingbrunn there was a drama.
When a helicopter landed, there was turbulence, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was captured by a gust of wind, crashed onto the ground and came to a halt at the side.
Police, rescue and fire department were immediately notified.
With a large order the forces came to the accident site.
The ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one property damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and could go home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and the subject of the investigation.
According to fire spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire that could quickly be extinguished.
Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female as of September 1st, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which was officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and presented to the German Press Agency in advance.
"Companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise international competitors will pass them," said Foundation Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male management teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
The gap makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented in comparison.
It's a different corporate culture.
Moreover, the slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies was due solely to positive impulses from the companies in the medium-sized index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
At the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will be recruiting consistent women again next year - in their own interests," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signaled that they would continue to make no commitment to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
A different picture emerges from the supervisory boards: As of September 1, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If just as many women were recruited for board members every year, a 40 percent share would have been achieved by 2023," the report says.
Some even make pussies: Luxury bodies: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?

"Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros operating profit with every car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put a strong emphasis on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices of an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros in profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

Torch procession to the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Wine Festival
The Tourist Association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session with a torchlight procession.
For the 60th time the association organizes the wine festivals, which from now on rise every Saturday in October in the large tent on Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, the responsible people moved under the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn through the place to the Festplatz.
The chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe, welcomed the guests in the already proppenvolle Festzelt. "To do this for 60 years - this is a fantastic achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of this," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Weinprinzess Lisa II. later symbolically met with the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many have found their way to Abtswind again." Later, "Die Troglauer" provided the atmosphere.
On Sunday, on which Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had fixed the drinks prices in the afternoon on the occasion of the anniversary as 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5th, in the guest's house, before one day later in the tent in the second round.
In Bonn: Emergency car crashes in taxi
An ambulance is heavily damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passerby was fatally injured in the collision of the vehicle with a taxi.
If emergency doctors are called, they should help - best even save human lives.
Such a rescue mission took a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of an ambulance car with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were severely injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the ambulance car had run over a red light with blue light and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then came across a crossing with the taxi that was driving at Green.
After the collision, the doctor's car hurled at a traffic light pole and a tree.
He captured the passerby who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of the ambulance and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from emergency forces.
The 29-year-old physician, who was also severely injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another emergency doctor called in tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn Public Prosecutor's Office, investigate who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we find it uncomfortable
After the blamable off in the league cup, Manchester United now also loses in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1:3. The way of defeat is likely to still be talked about.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute in which the regenerate Marko Arnautovic shot the 3-1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester defensemen stopped and allowed Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball by the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of a previously over long distances of insufficient performance.
The current mood at Uniteds Stadtrivale Manchester City is quite different.
The Citizens trained by Mourinho's big competitor Pep Guardiola came to a 2-0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the defense bar of the outsider for the first time for the home team.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goal scorer, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer league leader
==References====External links==*Soccerway profile*Soccerway profile*Soccerway profile*Soccerway profile
Like the Cup-off, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After the Reds had started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and the Reds in the Liga now also dropped the Blues Liverpool from the top of the league.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, in which Granit Xhaka played through, had to stand up against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire until the 81st minute for a success report.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defenseman Craig Cathcart made an unfortunate entry of Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third hit of the season.
Thanks to the fifth consecutive victory, Arsenal passed Watford and is now in fifth position immediately behind the big rival Tottenham. Wolverhampton continues to make a strong impression under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten for the fifth time in a row in the 2-0 against Southampton in the league and took eighth place.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show in the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let go of the German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showing their new products from the coming week together with competitors from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not really play a big role in this.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should still be an important topic, at least behind the bright scenes of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have among other things their first pure electric models: The e-tron of the Ingolstädter is expected to enter the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
But both have been officially presented.
BMW's iNext will not start until 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3 Series.
This year, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were a good one million visitors.
During the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport links are damaged, and enormous damage has been caused.
After the earthquakes, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
Hundreds had gathered on the beach in the coastal town of Palu for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims will increase significantly.
The figures so far only come from Palu.
However, there are also numerous other communities affected - along the west coast of Sulawesis.
About 150 bikers celebrate divine service in Werdohl
Motorrad-Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final divine service for the motorcyclists in the Friedenskirche in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The place in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of a month at Haus Nordhelle.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated at the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
There were about 150 bikers gathered on Sunday to do anything but ordinary worship.
Already from 10 o'clock the Bolids were lined up in front of the entrance door of the church.
At first, the biker early school was on the program and it was possible to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given by Father Dirk Grzegorek during the biker service.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical accompaniment.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill rather beats poetically and calmly," says Father Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle service yesterday.
Fühtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big festival: After the apple comes the milk
Borisch was also active at the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated step by step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice to his amazed spectators.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and had them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how it would become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
Wrapped in moulds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which look a little like bunny, layer by layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was not that difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the farmer from Fühtorf also had already finished filled specialties with him.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented the latest spring whites to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Fuchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere the parents got into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discover the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Also active members of the Fuchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers engaged in the festival and invited at some stations to entertaining games.
In the coming year, the Heimatverein will also offer an action day.
Then, however, according to Gregor Krützkamp, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of action.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: After all, it will go around the milk.
1:4 vs. Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season break: "Shit situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
However, much positive was not to be seen in the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out as a team," said 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegler, postponing: "That's disappointing, of course, because you always do a lot of things."
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met to the connection, stand with two counters at the very bottom and are in their current constitution a candidate for descent.
Leading by the outstanding Ante Rebic, however, Frankfurt celebrated its first home win in the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46,300 spectators, who, after the successful rehearsal for the European League match against Lazio Rome, advanced to the midfield of the table with seven points.
Croatia's Vice-World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hessen during his debut as a starter and never to get a grip on Hannover's defenses.
The striker, long beaten after the World Cup, showed with his speed and assertiveness why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, Allan, who had been loaned by Liverpool FC, was in the early formation of the Frankfurters for the first time.
Lucas Torró's (17th) headball falsified on the net brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defence around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back) in the short run.
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty room after a fenced-off corner, Haller extended his head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga match for AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt went down before the break.
This time, Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who was well refueled and 96-torwart Michael Esser didn't take a chance.
In the mid-term Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played a bit more courageously forward, but sparking ideas remained out until shortly before the end, when the next hit finally succeeded.
The Hessen were much more efficient there.
After an hour, Rebic started a solo and then laid across on De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was for the Frankfurters against overburdened guests only show runs, also Jovic met one minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile

Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on 14 September or Sunday afterwards.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year-old war and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood flowed out of the gunshot wound.
From this developed a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is still not finished, only the altar space stands, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the importance for the Geisinger parish, the service was poorly attended.
After the divine service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing ended the church part of the Cross Festival.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting visitors to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parsonage.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish still offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, the sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
Since the scaffolding has already been in place for some time, the damage has been detected more precisely and the individual calls for tenders have been prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but more has also been found, which was only made possible by the inspection by means of scaffolding.
The base plastering works are completed, before winter the natural stone works are to be started and it is hoped that more than half of these works will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New dormitory in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new dormitory for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" is handed over to its destination - all those present agreed at the inauguration date.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair users, who have already been living in the dormitory of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time, are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former US Army officer building was put to the test for the residents with cell phone cap: "The house had come into the years and was no longer up-to-date in the equipment," Bader said in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved in to tear down the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, says the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
The Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both temporally and financially.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between an accessible and fireproof design was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move even without foreign help.
The head of the social administration of the Schwaben district, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said similarly: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants, who need resources to be mobile".
The homeliness and functionality had been well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it can no longer be acquired in today's situation".
In total, the new residence in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on almost 1500 square meters, which are divided into three residential groups.
Proud is Lebenshilfe managing director Heinz on the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariff.
Germany: Schwesig complains about differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, the deputy SPD chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked longer on average than people in West Germany, but would receive 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has presented two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs to South Korean President Moon Jae.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs reached their destination on Thursday, about a year old.
They thus passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food in order to facilitate the "accustomation" of the animals.
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North had announced the gift of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the Olympic Games in 2032.
Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri rocket propulsion test facility as part of the mutual approach.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year of commemoration, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect to the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "Image Book" of Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New Week, New Chance for Government
Back to substantive work - that is the unofficial motto for the working week of the grand coalition beginning today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not at last mantra-proclaim the "return to practical work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what actually is the difference between work and work, but be it so.
If the Federal Government is now ready to return to its mandate - to govern - it should not be prevented from doing so with debate on terms.
Monday may already show whether Union and SPD can do something together after the provocations and embarrassments of recent weeks.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all this dispute.
At first, however, there are again conflicting issues on the agenda with the diesel retrofits and the skilled labour immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get away with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation for technical retrofitting of older diesels.
While there has been a convergence over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned labour force immigration law.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "track change" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute between the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not the same and the same has joined forces with the GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities.
Argument is good.
Without a dispute, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not move forward.
But in order to be constructive, dispute must not be built up again for party-tactical reasons on the question of being or not being.
This is still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD should fight - but always keep an eye on the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and beneficial to many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be resolved pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, that is why the People's Party must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in sight
Does the Minister of Labour, of all people, violate the current law of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" her legists had worked on the social security reform, reported a pervasive social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
With Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) meets with surprise - she brings the matter now via question to the Parliament.
She assumed that "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the use of her team and did not want to announce any violations of the applicable service law in front of current cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to "exempt Hartinger from any suspicion".
Police tear up a street in search of women's corpses
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning is dug on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
The investigators had previously used an archeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with his guide, was able to finally limit the relevant position to a few meters in repeated use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian conservation authority in the area of the said street.
For more than a year now, the Procuratorate and Criminal Police Court have been handling the missing person's case.
Again and again a bike path was closed at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that Heike's body might have been buried here 30 years ago in the course of the new construction of the state road.
Colour Powder and Eggs: Riots in Barcelona before Catalonia’s anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be held for the first time.
But there are riots before that.
The separatists did not forget the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan referendum on independence on 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and the police took place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked with paint powder by the independence advocates, among other things, in order to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3000 officials from the police units Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honour their colleagues who were in the polling stations last year in the referendum, which was classified as illegal.
At that time, violence had also occurred in trying to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the approximately 6000 separatists would have tried forcefully to break through the police chain, throwing paint bags and eggs at the officials.
Six people had been arrested and 24 others had been slightly injured, according to the authorities.
The independence referendum will be held for the first time on Monday.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had imposed on Catalonia a compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, remain in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the compulsory administration was terminated.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate tollless
Red-white Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
At FC Gütersloh, too, it was only enough to score a 0–0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion, the final light and the third last light turned out to be a congregated perplexity.
The first half was quite manageable from the entertainment factor.
Those who wanted to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so unconcerned.
There was no danger of missing a torch, because there were practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire match in the 28th minute.
The Ahlener had the best - and in principle only real - opportunity when Cihan forced Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling to parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty limit.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stormer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel from 18 meters aimed just above the housing and after an hour the Gütersloher also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a shooting of Matthew Wieckowicz, it went straight.
Nick Flock (62.) "crowned" the quickly presented counter about Sinan Aygün with a slick shot in the arms of RWA-torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also played a headball by Wieckowicz (66.) after a corner ball by ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, initially brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It didn't do anything.
The Ahleners did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It wasn't until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but she didn't bring anything either.
Angelo Daut afterwards tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero". But unfortunately the zero also stood in the front.
"This time we weren't as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede and that was even though our opponent didn't want to play here," stated RW Ahlen's interim trainer.
Offensively, "everything was a little chattering" against a team that just wanted to defend.
At least I didn't feel like we could get a countergate," Daut said.
To his sorrow, however, as a spectator, one did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Harvest Market: Fortunately there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabenstelle are pleased about this.
The volunteers insure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, while the place was still a little empty, but that was to change during the day.
Because: "It's so nice social here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent pinch of humor.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed up against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough creimers.
And the "replacement" could not be taken away from musically entertaining the more and more growing visitors.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at a later hour.
"Just great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased about the many actives with their stands, among them mainly clubs.
"Actually there should be no such thing as a table," he thanked nevertheless for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all those who were in action at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" campaign.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful painting - something works here.
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück took the Maykranz with the help of the fire brigade and brought it to the winter quarter.
Many stalls worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty, everything was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative at his Dekupiersäge.
He had veneer work, beer lid with Reckenfelder motifs and a lot more on offer.
Three Reckenfelder beekeepers offered a speciality: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought with them by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wetershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a speciality.
Honeycake in glass, of course, with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
The conviviality is what left the visitors long until the evening hours, even without the stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrication with local policy message: No successful advertising for skate equipment
In Lengerich, unknown people have promoted the construction of a skate park in a hardly beneficial way.
According to Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN, there are corresponding lubrications in several places.
In at least one case, the police have been charged with damage to property.
In large letters the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" were displayed on signs, among others, at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering had already been discovered on the advertising sign at the stairway to the Gempt bistro after the trade fair on 19 September.
Since the short message at that time had apparently been left "only" with an Edding, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, however, it was there again, this time sprayed up," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the appropriate advertising sign has to be replaced.
It is precisely this case that gets a special note by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also called on the board.
If the skate facility is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There were already commitments, explained Jörg Hesselmann of the urban department School, Sport and Culture, without mentioning names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skating facilities.
After the old LWL clinic had been dismantled, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the majority of the Council voted in favour of the fire park.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
A reversal followed at the end of June.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word was then given to the City Council.
It assumes a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Air traffic control congestion is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European aviation chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said Matthias Maas, head of the Air Traffic Control Union, the German Press Agency, at the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures was the long-known shortage of personnel in European air traffic control, for which there was no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
The market for fully trained pilots is empty throughout Europe.
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the Federal Government, the Länder, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic city on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, it won't work without us," explained the head of the GdF, who has many members at the German Air Traffic Control Agency.
Maas again blamed the EU Commission for the pilot miser.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and staff savings for national air traffic control systems are now fully operational.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut off the air" from air traffic control.
At present, EU targets would be agreed by 2024 and further tightening would be feared.
The EU is exposed to constant lobbying by airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," said Maas.
He hoped that the high delay costs for airlines would lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only be involved in improving the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offers a "consistent training and future pact", said Maas.
The 120 pilot pupils per year over the next five years, announced so far, are just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favour of the plans for the restructuring of the Group.
According to Thyssenkrupp interim CEO Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Management Board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-stricken group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are said to have their headquarters in Essen and to be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff cuts beyond the already known reductions in the administration.
After two resignations, the supervisory body counts only eight heads on the capital side.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
Among other things, the new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include the 50% share of the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demonstrations of police officers and Catalan supporters of independence.
Two simultaneous demonstrations of Spanish police and Catalan supporters of independence in Barcelona have resulted in violent clashes with numerous injured people.
According to the city administration, about 3000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police had tried to keep the two protest marches away from each other with a large order.
According to the forces, however, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and throwing bullets.
It was reported that there was also a range between the participants of the various protest marches.
According to rescue personnel, 24 people were injured.
The police reported that there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police had wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had taken action almost exactly one year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Spanish police and Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they thrashed us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights, and we are doing it in Barcelona, because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues had "not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Pannes allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A vulnerability in a mobile app has meant that the personal data of ministers and MPs of the Conservative British Tory Party was temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known one day before the Tory Party Day in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
The police Hannover reported a serious traffic accident on the Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died driving their car against a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The forces are on site.

Football: Juve-Trainer praises for top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star stormer "played the best game this evening along with the half hour of Valencia", Juve-Coach praised Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively bought-in star was the decisive man in the important game against the chaser even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's good," Allegri said.
Even if we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goal templates, Juve turned the game through the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) after the early downfall and hung the worst chaser for the time being.
The goaltender, who had been picked up by Real Madrid, first played for former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26./49.).
And Ronaldo also did the preliminary work for the goal of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76.) after a corner by headball, who had only to push in shortly before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," the coach praised.
But of course Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalkeeper in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve goal scorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in his account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros the supremacy of Juventus seems to become even more overwhelming.
Seven victories in seven games are the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has six points advantage over Naples.
The second place in the league, which was coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the presentation of Mario Rui (58.), who had already been warned, the top part was decided.
The Portuguese had to get off the course after too hard a climb against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.

The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the course in the 2-0 victory of the Turiners and is closed for the home match on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly bizarre performance, rapper Kanye West has attracted attention at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change of name on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, let's just call him "Ye," says the musician.
"The essence that was formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince when he took his stage name.
The pseudonym, however, is not news.
The tenth album was already released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious significance for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you," says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
We did it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was simply more grippy, we almost never put him before problems." Accordingly thin reads the list of the Hoetmar shooting possibilities.
Grade two goals in 90 minutes, so games can rarely be made positive.
Football Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first round, but the first took advantage of Maik Krause from a sharp angle for the early lead (7th).
Steffen Uphus could have increased in the 43rd minute, but after a great preliminary work by Krause he changed his name freely.
The hosts only had a double possibility when Moritz Höne failed at first at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and in the following shot Jan Blome also found his master in Sendenhorst Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61st) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all forgave.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the goal line by hand and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could not also use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stabbed the ball over the line was the game decided (81.).
"We had criticized each other hard before, and that was different today than in the last few weeks," concluded Florian Kraus.
Sending nest: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Tore: 0:1 Krause (7th), 0:2 Berheide (81st).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think of it," he struggled for words.
"We didn't get access to them at all," he supposedly meant the wing-pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-whites, who noticed with a collective offensive urge.
Nevertheless, he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, winking cheeky and pulling from then on his players, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class preservation.
GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him with understandable mixed feelings.
"That was by far our best performance in the season," he says.
"As we come back after the 0:2, as we keep against one of the league's top teams over the entire season, that was really phenomenal."
All the more bitterly, it seems that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top goal hunter Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season hit (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2-0 he put over the left side exemplary for Fabian Frühning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take a player like that out completely.
"That was already madness what he did", Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent without envy.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own eleven managed to balance: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long Toreck (45.).
After the change of sides it was again McGill who achieved the compensation (59.).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nubel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann was able to compensate (69.).
Despite the excess, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80.) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we now have to win," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nubels (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins point against Primus
There were no winners in the Landesliga duel between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The team leader had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and at the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: Resignation of the Executive Committee of Dynamo Dresden
According to media reports, the entire presidium of second-tier football player Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
In the evening, several media alluded to a joint letter from the Committee of Saxony.
There was no confirmation of the club at first.
The reason for the withdrawal is said to be internal power struggles in the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Celebrity guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to personally collect the tolerance prize in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as President of the Federal Republic, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
This was how Academy Director Udo Hahn reckoned with him when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us." However, the fact that celebrities were appearing at the Academy at Tutzing Castle was also an issue during the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October songwriter Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, on 29 September the writer Frido Mann is at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also agreed to accept the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy personally in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid 2019 have it in themselves.
"The pension is not safe!" is written in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "barbarism without limit".
Arms dealings, destruction, torture, death - the war mocks every human idea."
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change of work through digitization.
Academy director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions".
At a meeting on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the
Karl Marx's birthday will soon be expected by one more visitor to the direction of capitalism criticism, the others rather a tendency "from left to center".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Musikkabarett: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret woman, Teubner presided over gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (feeling) woman and the (feeling) man and what else there might be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat at the wing.
He is on the one hand the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes up with words until the end of the sentence, on the other hand a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies so congenially harmoniously that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely the way it fit the red thread of the evening.
Then Teubner had brought into play a paradox: The satisfaction with the man comes when he has a partner but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, however, is of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have emerged from Mozart's composing if "the Nannerl" had opened the door unexpectedly?
So Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt full of blood and wounds" into the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's G minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers were presented to Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck could not take an additional thanks.
She had the idea to treat the duo to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.

The controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk is allowed to remain CEO of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, but has to resign as Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Musk also agreed with the US Stock Exchange Supervisory SEC to pay a double-digit million fine, according to the SEC.
Background is Musk's surprising announcement of August to take Tesla off the stock market.
The SEC accused Musk of having provided false and misleading information.

After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police corrected the number of victims slightly downwards.
10 instead of 15 passengers were slightly injured.
Everyone is now released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night to watch.
He was released during the day, said a spokesman for the police.
The reason for the accident of the long-distance bus at Bruchsal was still unclear.
The long-distance bus was unbraked frontally against a guardrail on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women's national league: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest close to TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlenerinnen had problems especially with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who only marked ten hits.
"Actually, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player made too many goals.
We couldn't control them," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more upset about the many missed opportunities.
His team missed the focus this time.
The ASG was therefore almost behind a gap until the end, at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45).
Only towards the end did the broader bank of the hostesses become decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu put Merle Klement back on the left, which then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Rushaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd league women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top match at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top match, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
The Blue-Whites won 3-1 at VC Allbau Essen.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
That's what we've worked out now," said coach Dominik Münch after an almost impeccable performance of his team at the fallen leader of the table.
The first pass was dominated by the guests almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice-champion of the previous year.
Dinner took place in the two-bar, but it didn't come into play.
We've been busy with them.
Our opponent has opened up with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second movement, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen changed the assumption to three-bars.
We couldn't hold the impact pressure.
Food sucked in, and we got a little lulled in," Münch continues.
At the 18:17 the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had the lead for the first time.
Ostbevern fought off four sets at 19:24, but the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," said the instructor to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV turned the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and quietly there".
About 7:3 and 15:13 brought the blue-white passage four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dirtmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great mosque of Ditib in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left behind a pile of shards in the German-Turkish relationship that can only be painfully combined," said Gökay Sofuoglu, Chairman of the TGD, the German editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German side had missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of underlining the belonging of Muslims to Germany with German leaders, Erdogan has used the appointment for his purposes," lamented Sofuoglu.
The broad exclusion of the German public had "reinforced many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break is finally Folktreff time again.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln already organizes its fifth Nottuln folk meeting in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost exactly to the day it is then a year ago that we have carried out a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk meeting was so fast in Nottuln eta.
No matter if Storm Deep Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"As always, the program at the next Folktreff is a colourful mix of German folk, hiking and seaman songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer promised with his accordion for the first folk meeting "Birthday".
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring Steinfurt district that played music with flat German lyrics.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff will be happy to remember the last event in summer, when Christoph Schulz from Folktreff Emsdetten inspired the audience with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend a sociable and humorous evening once again," says the invitation of the Heimatverein.
If you play an instrument and want to participate actively, you are invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always occupied quickly, it is recommended to be there early enough.
Folk Treff starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is at 7 p.m.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are making another step on the way to becoming the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority approved the proposed merger, informed Linde on Sunday.
This means that approvals in South Korea and - as the largest hurdle - in the USA are still pending for the billion-dollar merger.
Recently, the chances of an insider's approval had improved because Linde promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding questions must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall, the 125th anniversary of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege was celebrated.
On 29 September 1893 the last founding impulses for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
At that time, however, it was still called "Kulmbach Stadt und Land" ("District Sobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land") and was christened by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit growing association also differed from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit growing, about flowers and horticulture no one thought at that time.
"At that time, during the Enlightenment period, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his festive lecture.
Fruit trees should line highways, schools have built so-called industrial gardens.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But this is far from exhausted.
A natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as important a role as the conveying of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwerfen" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said District Chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The chestnut collection was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of joy with Smartphone & Co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand is decided by the district association", added Landrat Söllner and emphasized the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The county association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district left no doubt to it also district managing director and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with a presentation through the long history of the Kreisverband and reported among other things on the necessity of self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, it was put in for the winter.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden had turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature persists, it was there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," the expert pleaded for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, there is the incentive for the horticultural associations not to let down so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian State Association.
"We have to stop the blatant decline of insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif, who was solemnly framed by the tower blowers of the Musikverein Thurnau.

Priority to Nafta Talks: Canada's Foreign Minister Moves UN Speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on the matter of Nafta: they place an ultimatum for an agreement between both trading partners.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives the trade agreement absolute priority - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister would not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, their spokesman Adam Austen announced.
In the meantime, she concentrates on the renegotiation of Nafta.
On Friday, Mexican Minister of Economy Ildefonso Guajardo declared that Canada and the United States had 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the United States.
The US and Mexico agreed in August on a recast of the Nafta regional free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Discussions about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are to be brought to a conclusion, Trump's government wants to submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1st.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-designate, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, left the hospital.
The extreme-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, according to the newspaper "O Globo".
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on the street in early September during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht") women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations made racist and women's contemptive statements mobile against Bolsonaro.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mingled with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and therefore is not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As ex-mayor of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has long been involved in politics, it has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieve the absolute majority in the first round, there will be a running vote on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from it successfully - no matter who he is fighting against.
Bolsonaro is known for inciting homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula's left-wing workers' party should be shot.
Europe recovers Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour away from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup tale at the gates of Paris.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 years after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen reported on Larsen's website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children on the deathbed.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday in a statement as "street boys" who "was against everything, but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared at the 70th birthday of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark in 2010.
Rocknacht in the shoe factory: volume at press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a rewriting of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock by three other bands.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no sign of stage fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - delight with their bands the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito"-Rocknacht visibly.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows to convince with the start of the concert evening also latest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage the band dances to the harmonious and powerful interplay of the band.
Although "Zubgabe" calls cannot be missed, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that hard rock is not the same as hard rock with their alternative, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is also used for "Here We Stand" in addition to guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishchen, however, has gained a special reputation since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its appearances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China from 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also sets his own accents for the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
In the meantime, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a acclaimed solo with a higher level of sound than before, running through the audience.
A certain volume is of course part of this at such a hard rock concert: according to information from the mixing console team, the "Mint Mosquito" rock night at the three-part concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the level of a hammer, but is still clearly below the controls of the Wacken Fesitval, which "The Ignition" point to on their website.
However, the Ahlen audience doesn't need 120 decibels in jet drive volume as usual with the annual Metal-Stelldein in the north of the Republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking gait have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, took the bone saw and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger", all three groups, of course in a figurative sense, can say in the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead man in a glider accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim/Essen airport.
A glider crashed on Sunday in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near Mülheim/Essen airport.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider crashed at the fair parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was alone on board - the plane should be a single-seater.
At the time of the accident, the plane had already been in the approach.
The crash site is only a short distance from a tent on the airport grounds.
But an Oktoberfest has been taking place since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the city boundary of the two Ruhrgebietscädte and directly at the entrance to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at major events at the Essen Fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that North Korea’s leader Kim is well disposed despite the nuclear crisis.
But now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has become a new flame.
The Tragic: It's a long-distance relationship.
Donald Trump publicly made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of followers in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old offspring of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although it proves to be quite tough in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, he was tough, and we went back and forth," Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection had also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim's announced stop of all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip service.
The US president seemed quite aware that the affection for the notorious "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - that his martial threatening gestures were not something for everyone.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism of it at his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
It's so unpresidial.
But he cares very little about this, Trump explained, and then pointed his index finger at the crowd: "I always told you it was so easy to be presidential."
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there pushing into this crowded arena, but we would only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler

Rescued refugees from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya with the help of a cell phone video, thus enabling them to be saved.
The group had filmed the photo in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under danger of life and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, the AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya in an attempt to get to Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he put himself, according to his own statement, in danger of life.
One of his comrades was beaten almost to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the adhesion conditions were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year with the help of the programme, said the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians was not exceptional in view of the poor prison conditions in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a cell phone video call so far.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
On Sunday afternoon, when a teacher went to elementary school to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the front of the first floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher contacted the police who started the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot yet be said.
Perpetrator description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark trousers, dark T-shirt.

German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to stay in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in central Franconia, after he had stuck the car away from all forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and liberated the missing person since Tuesday evening, the police reported on Sunday.
According to the data, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned from a trip with his off-road vehicle over the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search, the whereabouts of the man had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) in conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own statements, called for the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns above all the waves of arrest, the freedom of the press and religion.
He therefore "made it clear at Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this".
According to Laschet, he also referred to the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Mr Erdogan then reiterated the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building for the Federal Ministry of Defense at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the discussion Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their point of contact - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of stressing the success of the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington's complicity.
North Korea's Secretary of State Ri Yong Ho accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons with its continuing sanctions during the UN General Debate.
"The recent stalemate is due to the US building on coercive measures that are fatal to building confidence," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament was unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there will be no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
That sanctions could force North Korea to "knee" is "a dream of people who don't know us."
However, in order to build trust, his country had stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed an atomic test facility, Ri emphasized.
However, there had been no "corresponding reactions" from the US side, the minister criticized.
Last year alone, the UN Security Council adopted three sanctions against the internationally isolated country because of North Korea's nuclear and missile program.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, have been urging the United Nations to strictly comply with the sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang for talks on the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing of it: White blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet awaited the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: A power failure had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," Westbuer said.
And that's how everyone got involved.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Cooks can't do better either," praised one visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to serve quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have done," emphasized Rev. Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen caused amazement with card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the state board NRW of the board
Jörg Sartor, head of the Essener Tafel, has left his post in the Landesverband out of frustration about criticism from his own ranks.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a stopover for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice-president of the NRW panels, said Sartor of the "Welt am Sonntag".
Too many fell in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the Landesverband NRW, expressed his understanding of the dpa for the decision of his long-standing deputy.
The sharp criticism has taken Sartor away.
"I can understand his step - there were people who didn't know exactly why the Essener Tafel did it."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday" Sartor again criticized colleagues from other panels.
One should not take the approach "without us the people of the city starve".
It was the task of the state to ensure that people did not starve to death.
The Essener did not attend a conference of the tables on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm told too much sweet taste," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis who criticized me at the time.
SF Lorch play 2:0-Leadership - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, district league Lorch loses against newcomer 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after lags - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
Quite different from TV Heuchlingen: In Kirchheim the TVH quickly got into the background with 0:1, but after 90 minutes it won with 2:1. At the top of the table the SGB was able to win with a 3-0
Gladbach playful twice guided tour - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an away victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first win of the season (1:0).
(sda) Four times in the first five league games Schalke has maneuvered himself into the far side with early opponents.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again showed the strength with which it had won the first place behind the Bavarians in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the homeequipe in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Evgeni Konopljanka by head, in the following the hosts conserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund once again greets from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had scored a 0:2 loss against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the 2nd half they won the 4:2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) matched with a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided with another doublet in the final phase (86./94.) for the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart also won the first victory.
Werder Bremen, who had already decimated before the break due to a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, had to fear the Stuttgarters in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious throw-in owner, which helped the guests to balance in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful but also no failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave Gladbacher a lead twice, finally played 2:2 and have been waiting since 2003 for an away victory in the VW city.

At the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was powerless, as was the second hit after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promising.
In the storm of the foals, Alassane Pléa proves to be a goalgetter.

After seven laps Gladbach takes fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously undefeated Werder Bremen maneuvered itself against the VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable situation.
After 19 minutes the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first hit in the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to add to his team: the 23-year-old Serbe collected yellow-red after a jersey pimp against Daniel Didavi.
Although Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back into the game through a curious throw-in owner (68.), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the overnumbering Stuttgarters back on the Siegesstrasse.
Nuremberg won the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens brought the home team on course with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, some 1.8 million citizens now vote on whether to change their country's name in northern Macedonia.
In a yes, the almost three decades-long smoldering conflict with the neighbour Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and had blocked any approach of Macedonia to the West.
Voters therefore also decide on the future of Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a member of NATO in a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrians in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three pensioners and injured them severely.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted on Friday at around 10 p.m. in the escape lane in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who went out on passers-by with his fists clenched and tried to attack them, about his behaviour.
As a result, the Syrian tried to beat and kick the officials.
A short time later it turned out that the suspect had beaten three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) to the ground with his fists shortly before in Währinger Straße at a tram stop.
He had also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematoma, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for unknown cause", as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and continuously monitored during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them said yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper that a registered partnership had not been considered for them.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a fiscal spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused a stir on 30 June 2017.
Thus, he accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"That was your Shabowski moment," he said in reference to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the citizens' association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprosy.
Because around 400 meters hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, chairman of the Citizens' Association.
And there's been a lot of accumulation.
Because of the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a form cut.
Because already in the spring the hedge had been shorn before.
The breakfast that always follows the work also has a long tradition.
"Everyone should stay strong," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner brings gold at the Canoe Slalom World Championships
The Augsburg-based Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the conclusion of the canoe slalom world championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had already had enough rides here at the facility and it all worked out today," said the London 2012 Olympic third.
In the finish, he threw away his paddle with joy and raised both arms confidently to the height - knowing that it would be at least enough for one medal.
After all, he had start number four.
However, the six remaining starters could not top up his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech Jiri Prskavec became second in front of the Russian Pavel Eigel.
Police inspector Gauting reports the first attempt to break into a single-family home this autumn.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - this is what burglars want to take advantage of again.
So yesterday the police inspectorate Gauting reported the first attempt to break in this fall.
It is thanks to the alarm system that it stayed at the single family house on Königswieser Straße.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system surprised them, however, to such an extent that they took flight without loot.
Notes to PI Gauting, phone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Pleit at Hertha: Catched by reality: Bavaria against Ajax demanded
The title is unbeatable: FC Bayern "does not want to let itself be defeated" in Berlin.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the tenure of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance ball under the new coach Niko Kovac is not supposed to increase to the larger autumnal low for the Munichers.
"A week ago, we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now a bit of reality has caught up with us," Thomas Müller stated after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that's why we're going to speed up to Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goal was scored, as at the same time as the previous season, two compulsory matches in series without victory, the lead in the Bundesliga lost for the time being to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must nevertheless be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running-intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle-stitches over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, how the last overpowering Bavaria can be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we are not going to like this and that we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again," stressed Kovac.
Otherwise, however, he dealt surprisingly gently with his losers in his hometown and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only on the once again inadequate handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim conclusion of his term of office positive before the national break - otherwise the tone would probably worsen.
For example, Kovac did not take any extraordinary action before the second King Class appearance of this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary round against Ajax begins as planned, which at the start had also defeated Athens with 3:0.
"Now we've got it in two games, but we're going to make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place Joshua Kimmich spoke in particular plain text.
The right-wing defender appeared in the role as a reminder.
"I don't think that's all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes behind," the 23-year-old stressed shortly before the departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bayern were already behind Dortmund with five points, which has now taken the lead again with one point advantage.
And so Kimmich assessed with a wink at least positively that now the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
The Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany with serious accusations.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the union line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in the permanent dispute theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB leader defended the line of association.
On early Sunday morning, Grindel, personally attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the Causa in the ZDF "Sportstudio" in Mainz.
"In the future, because we also have many players with migration backgrounds in the U-teams, we need to draw very precise conclusions that this does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without migration backgrounds as a further integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and DFB.
He had harshly denounced a racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded her from this society because they had her photographed with me in England," Erdogan said in the cathedral city on Saturday.
To be honest, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have ascended to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonablely treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had begun with Erdogan's photos.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to stand in front of players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm migrant - I can't.
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration officer is to be appointed alongside the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football and says, "The issue is important, we have to take care of it," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration must work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup off and the Özil affair, he wants to run again for office as DFB President next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel.
Three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - According to the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 am and 1 pm.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the Lauter Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no personal exchange since the 75-year-old couldn't find the lady in the parking lot anymore.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had left the road and was driving against a lead post.
Asked about this, the man didn't want the police on the ground and then drove away.
Then the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, has lost his way and has rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car had significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and couldn't remember much more.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 operatives are still in operation.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 operatives are still engaged in the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to be stable according to a speaker, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of forces is planned, it is said.
On the night of Sunday, an above ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster was lifted, which was proclaimed a week earlier on September 21 because it was feared that the flames would endanger neighbouring forests and settlements by wind and spark flying.
Thursday it was then said, a spill over of the fire to adjacent communities no longer threatened.
At times, more than 1500 local forces tried to control the major fire.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned for October 2nd and 5th.
The fire had been triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand had temporarily moved up to a hundred kilometers far over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that receives damage reports.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them said yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper that a registered partnership had not been considered for them.
If we get married, we get married.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a fiscal spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused a stir on 30 June 2017.
Thus, he accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"That was your Shabowski moment," he said in reference to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the adoption law.
Referendum started in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its northern province of the same name, the neighboring Greece.
For almost three decades, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO as a means of exerting pressure.
If the citizens vote 'yes', they will also give the start to their country's Western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with express consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved if Swisstransplant is required.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be taken - as in Germany - only with express consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
According to Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation, 15 percent of Swiss citizens are expected to have a donor card.
But only in five percent of the cases would a card be found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, relatives do not know the wishes of the deceased.
"You then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Immer.
A similar registration system exists in the UK.
In Germany there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesperson of the Federal Centre for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - per or contra organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would be regarded as an organ donor first, unless he or she disagrees.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in headcounting
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in headcounting.
He won over 39 competitors in Wolfsburg on the weekend.
Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, announced this on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as main referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks include: 14,130 214 x 17,981.822 or 57,809.355 + 28 x 16,448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon in which participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was already in Bielefeld two years ago as a 14-year-old.
With terms like superbrain, genius or prodigy, organizer Laue can start little.
"Head count can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium-based computing competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, drawing the square root from six-digit numbers.
In the case of versatility calculations, the candidates get surprise tasks, for which they have to find a solution strategy quickly.
The Germans would also have good chances here, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage, because there, even in early childhood, head calculation is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Intrusive Appeal: Video with Naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams shows up from her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to point out breast cancer and to fight for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings on top without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate parts.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which deals with breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams died almost a year ago.
When her daughter Alexis Olympia was born, there were complications.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were then discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans to significantly extend the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-blue coalition will send a corresponding draft law on the so-called "symbols law" in review.
The aim is to significantly extend the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow on the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shakes her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 meters at strong intensity, it was said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of new snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher mountain pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start their annual kink care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein farmers are allowed to start the annual curd care on Monday.
The "green ramparts" unique in Germany have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor federal state for about 200 years.
The tree and shrub hedges up to five meters wide are "forest substitutes" and for many animals and plants the last retreats.
Knicks connect scattered habitats, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the nature conservation association Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are live fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of an order of the Dane King Christian VI in 1766, which ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limits and cattle fences, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also dates back to that time: By "turning around" the branches the dense, intertwined demarcations could develop.
Today, around 45 000 kilometres of hedges extend between the North and Baltic Seas and give the image of a woody, multi-structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7000 animal species as a replacement habitat.
In one kilometer of kink, up to 1800 different species could live and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the Knick can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
Otherwise he abdicates to a light row of trees, which in addition to biodiversity also loses wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, kink care may only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about situation on site
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the native Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you on site during the tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes occurred, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which are all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run on surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are staying in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people steal food and gasoline in part.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partly walking around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many dead bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island going?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but before that it didn't work and we only got information via the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors, and other people they do not know if they live or where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but were on the road at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons, but when the warning came, many thought, "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, lying on the Pacific Fire Ring, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to do without Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing from VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo had pulled a muscle fiber crack in the rear left thigh at the 2-1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football Bundesliga player announced on Sunday.
In Donis, doctors diagnosed a muscle fracture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the following international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not provide a forecast of downtime.
A muscle break usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle break usually heals a little faster.

However, the action lasted for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - walkers at Lake Olching noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the area of the water station.

In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat the fire brigade was able to circle the animal and push it back to land, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a hearty handle.
The duck injured in the breast was then taken to the LMU animal clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But according to the initial assessments, their chances of survival are rather low.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI Turbotempo Investigation
Time is extremely short and the number of scheduled interviews is very limited.
With a turbo-tempo FBI investigation, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the ultra-thin majority for the controversial judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of coercion.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for investigators until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents more than 30 years ago.
The latest turn in the drama about Kavanaugh's vocation, accompanied by a cultural struggle, had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing with Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in the course of which the lawyer ran furious tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Justice Committee was to clear the way for the final confirmation of the Erzkonservative judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secured when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had referred to the heavy reservations on Thursday as "disaster", initially abstained from further attacks against women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in misfortune".
In this way, he said, final doubts could be eliminated.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats in an election rally because they reject Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators.
One would specifically investigate the well-known accusations of two women, no more, a government representative told the Wall Street Journal: "They don't go on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" in the municipality of Ried for monitoring the speed limit is stationed on Gartenstraße from Monday, October 1st.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: The fear was felt
Trainers Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home match against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were lots of corners and lots of balls in our penalty room," said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the Königsblauen managed to bring the close 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first win of the season under control.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11. of the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given certainty Tedesco: "In total, the first half was good, both playfully and from pressing"., with increasing playing time obviously more and more the head played a role.
Don't be a headball monster.
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore kept retreating.
And defends against Mainz with a man and a mouse.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We have all fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the man making".
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start impressively in the initial phase and make a firework of it," said Schalke's chief coach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to play games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau missed it, rather for clearer conditions to worry about.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the slat 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a trembling victory," Tedesco said: "You've already felt the fear a little bit."
So I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only Schalker with that.
Fischbachau: smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From a distance of about two kilometres, a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire on Sunday around 1.30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The reason police and fire brigade soon found out: An unknown person had lit garbage on a two square meter area on the Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, he seemed to have monitored the fire for a long time, but then left the glow unattended.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were busy pulling and deleting.
The police are investigating arson now.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my job to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the "Cultural Policy" alliance in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very easily, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, solid numbers and one or the other joke, he brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflicting themes: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts increasingly arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At one table is the German society, at the cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to get to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always been sitting at the big table and now want to co-determine.
This leads to conflict.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether you place yourself politically on the right or on the left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?", he emphasizes.
At first rather behave, then the discussion round starts more and more lively.
And there's a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands before, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is on par with the others.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "we can only find solutions if we understand what the problem is," says El-Mafaalani.
During the signing session, he was also given an open ear to the questions of the guests and also in the foyer for prepared Kurdish specialities.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win kick-off games

Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: more than 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new Landsham-Süd area on the free market.
That's what Mayor Roland Frick tells us.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 plots offered by the municipality at more favourable conditions or prices is completed - similar to the former local model.
More than 100 applications have been received, says Frick.
"Currently the documents are checked", regarding the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Plieening, it is the goal to have established the candidate ranking for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
After that, the award could take place.
A total of 50 plots for single and double houses are created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family houses with eight residential units each.
The development is now almost complete and the roads and roads will soon be paved.
A single plot as well as two of the apartment houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in a socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two apartment houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented housing supported by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated, housing for about 200 people is created on the area of the new Landsham-Süd area.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, there is the start of the new construction of a day care center.
It will house three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multipurpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
Thus Schalkes Naldo succeeds "great sport" also on the bank
For the third time in a row not in the starting team: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not sat for the third time in a row in the Schalker start-elf, but on the replacement bench, the understanding would have been great with many people, if the almost two meter tall Brazilian had really talked the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1-0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual and thanked all his pros for the head coach Domenico Tedesco, the 36-year-old, who all simply call Naldo, stepped in and said, "We have to thank, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was a great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his reservist existence, had no resentment.
Perchscheinlích knows Naldo, who was celebrated last season as the best Schalker, that he did not actually get on the siding with his coach - but gets a break for good reasons.
A reason called "taxation control".
It wasn't easy to tell him that.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you quite honestly," Tedesco reported from the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the starting elf.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedesco explained the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can take a breath right now.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation that last caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian reacted with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself to be an exemplary team player at the bank.
The mood in Austria's industry continued to accelerate in August compared to the eurozone.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands across Europe, the Markit Institute reported on Monday to its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still 13 months in a row below the 50-point mark, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry hit this threshold with 50.9 points in August.
The final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined, albeit slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level since March, with 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened descent could mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry - in any case in the third quarter - remains the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone did not fall as strongly as since November 2011.
The companies therefore lost jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also declined more strongly in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing managers index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial enterprises.
Among other things, developments in turnover, employment, warehouses and prices will be raised.
Tuchel's PSG team succeeds in eighth league victory
September 29, 2018 at 07:45 PM
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel hurries with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship from victory to victory.
In the OGC Nice the defending champion won thanks to two hits of Superstar Neymar with 3-0 (1:0) and was thus also successful in the eighth league match.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and finished the final in the after-game season.
Christopher Nkunku (46.) provided the intermediate 2:0.
Paris also managed the rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the season, Tuchel's team had to accept the only mandatory match defeat this season at the 2:3 in Liverpool.
