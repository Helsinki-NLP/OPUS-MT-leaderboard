Biker responds lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening a traffic accident occurred on the highway between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Motorist overlooks biker
A 44-year-old motorist wanted to turn left from Merklingen to Landesstraße 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim at around 9.30 p.m. with her VW.
In this she overlooked the 24-year-old, right-of-way motorcyclist from the direction of Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away in the collision
The biker was still trying to avoid the car, but he still patrolled it at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the stripping process, the hand and foot brake levers were torn off on the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
In the present mind, he steered his motorcycle in the green stiffeners next to the roadway and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
However, due to the collision with the car, the biker suffered an injury to the patient and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavarian Mamming, almost 500 people are in quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
Security is monitoring the ban.
A total of 174 harvest workers were tested positive for the corona agent Sars-CoV-2 during the in-line investigation, as the district council office Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"Unfortunately, in order to avoid further spread, we have to take this step in order to protect the population," said District Councillor Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Seven employees had previously been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers only for inlay glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with a good 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people".
On the farm, infected were separated from uninfected employees, the site is now surrounded by a fence.
Greens and SPD gave co-responsibility to the state government.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the housing of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly avenged if such local infection events need to be exploited and regional lockdowns ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
The SPD sees this in a similar way: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest workers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"From our point of view, the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions must be closely monitored.
This obviously did not happen".
The outbreak had come "with announcement".
U-Bahnhof Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the rail bed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station, a 19-year-old fell down by a pusher and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday there was a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station around 4:15 p.m.
A passerby alerted the police, who approached with several stripes.
According to the first investigation, a Munich (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the platform edge and fell into the track bed.
Persons from the group of the 17-year-old helped the fallen out of the track.
There was no danger from an inbound train.
According to the police, there were again clashes between the two people.
The 17-year-old first fled the scene, but his personal details could be investigated afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to the police inspection 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Report: Seehofer pushes for longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
According to a media report, however, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) demands an extended retention of data - instead of the planned ten weeks a half year.
As the "Picture on Sunday" reports, Seehofer Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a quick amendment of the law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He considers it useful to "impressively make necessary adjustments to the law already now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
A decision by the ECJ on this is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments to be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it could only be meaningfully examined whether legal adjustments were needed if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already called for data retention in June.
NBA: Strip club upset for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, however, he still visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN data, is back in Isloation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for precisely these Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, ed.) have the best Wings in the city".
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday on Twitter that the NBA Williams has prescribed a ten-day quarantine.
The Clippers star thus misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to end the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finale beginning in the night on Friday.
Söder comments on the Corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has alarmed authorities and politics.
Almost 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and over a third have become infected with the corona agent.
The farm is now under quarantine and is locked off with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the site, food is delivered.
The authorities are now offering free Corona tests to the 3,300 residents of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt so far assumes that the infections did not spread beyond the farm.
"Conscience bite": Confession of the suspected arsonist of Nantes
"My client has shown cooperativeness," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defender added, "He deeply regrets the actions, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate "is plagued by a bit of conscience and very much taken with it by the extent of destruction".
According to the prosecutor's office, in the event of a conviction, the man is threatened with ten years in prison and a fine of EUR 150,000.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged in a fire on the night of Saturday last week.
The fire had erupted in three places far apart in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed suspicion of arson.
The now imprisoned suspect had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after one day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came into the eye of investigators.
Discussing the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," said Grindel of the "Picture on Sunday".
He stressed: "The 50+1 rules do not work for the clubs that are most likely to become dangerous to Bavaria and Dortmund: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, it is not possible to get around the debate whether it is necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations wishing to break into this phalanx".
However, he had doubts as to whether there was a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority shareholdings prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around Bundesliga as a business location in a single European market," said Grindel.
The former DFB chief sees the danger that "the attempts to create more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV money would not achieve a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are already immense among the first three clubs.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and pierced the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said about the adoption of an expensive clock that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That's been a lot of work for me humanly."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," said Grindel.
"With the ominous watch gift, I have dealt completely transparently and unsuspectingly.
Many in the DFB knew about it".
He had never "made a secret from the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"That may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption".
"Black Lives Matter": injured and a dead man
Protests against police violence in the United States have intensified again through Donald Trump's use of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, clashes between protesters and police took place in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville, and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was killed by gunshots while a demonstration train just crossed an intersection.
Previously, clashes had again taken place in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and violently disbanded protesters.
Hundreds, partly armed, protesters marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor should be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student had been shot dead in March at a drug raid in her apartment in Louisville.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there, and no drugs were found either.
On Saturday, when a member of a group calling itself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a gun, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in mortal danger.
The police set up barricades because they had also formed area demonstrators of a white militia.
In the end, there was no meeting between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, one person was shot and died in the course of a Black Lives Matter demonstration.
According to the police, a suspect was taken into custody.
It has not yet provided any detailed information on the circumstances of the case.
Mayor Steve Adler, according to the New York Times, said he was, like many in the city, "unruly and stunned" because of what had happened.
Protesters also clashed with the police in the American metropolis of Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to construction vehicles in front of a youth prison, the police used blend grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resistance to police or assault.
A courthouse was set on fire in the city of Oakland, California.
A small group of protesters had smashed windows, shot down fireworks, and blinded police officers with lasers, told Oakland police late Saturday night (local time).
The fire could be extinguished quickly.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car passed through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
According to the police, one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken injured to the hospital.
In addition, windows were also smashed in a court and a fire was set, as the police reported.
Investigations have been started.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the large sause in the spa town was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, actors and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city centre was missing, the crowds and program highlights like Saale, Rakoczy-Ball or Festzug, many of them came at their expense with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have managed to spread Rakoczy flair," says Director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have taken it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when the historical ones alone were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting the Rakoczy Festival in Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
So this time in the Corona year.
The couple made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold casino, watching the historical stroll and listening to Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I find it so pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She misses the crowds that normally do not belong to Rakoczy.
But she lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic procession and the closing fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's too bad.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy riding tournament to take place again
For the actors of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant partly more work.
For example for Christina Gold, who participates in the procession in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was on foot in the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
"That's more exhausting, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The riders' club had less to do, even if individual riders were on the road in the park.
"We very much hope that the rider quadrille will be allowed to take place again next year," says President Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years break in 2021, a Rakoczy riding tournament will also take place again.
28 Corona cases with Spanish second division club Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football second league player CF Fuenlabrada is slipping deeper and deeper into the crisis due to a Corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid had flown to the city of A Coruña despite first Corona cases on July 20, a low blow follows the next one.
By Sunday 28 players or team members had been tested positive, one came to the hospital, as the club announced.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name south west of Madrid had the chance to reach the ascension playoffs.
Now even the descent into the B-group of the Second League is threatened.
The match against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the prosecutor's office investigating a possible offense against public health, the top sports authority CSD is considering the club's forced descent.
The players and other team members are in quarantine at a hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they have not received a fresh towel and gel," wrote the sports newspaper "AS".
Photos show how players hung underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel to dry after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
The bed linen was also not changed for five days.
Another problem is food.
Neither good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club management, on the other hand, said that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The accusation of deliberately endangering public health was rejected by the club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
The Spanish Primera Division's son Javier Tebas, as reported by the Europa Press news agency and the sports newspaper "Marca", had not been violated by the Corona rules established by the Football Association.
Before the departure, there had been four infected persons until 19 July, all of whom had been isolated and had not travelled with them.
Immediately before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members had been tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, further team members of the Corona test were positive on "five or six".
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the whistle, said Tebas Llanas.
Police must catch horses torn out of steamach
Two animals were on the road.
The police took her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning just before 6 a.m., a road user shared two free-running horses on the feeder between the Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld junction and the Theres motorway junction.
At the arrival of the officials, the horses were already again between the feeder and the village of Dampach.
After the officers were able to gain the confidence of the horses shortly before Dampach, they each had a rope carried in the patrol car.
Bike professional Tony Martin: Career-continuation conceivable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm setting the framework conditions with the team for how and in what form it could continue," said the 35-year-old of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after that year before the Corona-Pause.
The negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
He used to stand up after a fall, and the first thought was, "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a little daughter, I think: What if".
The cyclist acknowledged that there are aspects with which he is increasingly difficult.
"But it was good for me to see what I had about cycling and how much fun it was with the Corona time".
At the Tour de l'Ain (5th to 9th August), the time trial specialist enters the competition again.
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria's streets at the weekend
The beautiful weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
For at least three people, the tour ends deadly by motorcycle.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also dies.
Schönthal - In accidents on Bavaria's roads several, mostly young people died on the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was caught on Saturday at Schönthal (Cham County) by a car that came on the opposite track.
It was initially unclear why the car was placed on the opposite track.
In Upper Bavaria on Saturday, a 22-year-old bumped into a horse-drawn carriage on his machine.
According to the Beilngries police, he was on his way downhill.
In a left-hand curve, he bounced against the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the twelve inmates of the carriage, one man was severely injured and one man slightly injured, as the police reported.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old died in Bad Kötzting, Upper Palatinate.
He had laid down on a road that night for Sunday and was overrun by a 42-year-old motorist.
According to the police, the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver could no longer brake in time.
At Schönberg (Landkreis Freyung-Grafenau), a 57-year-old biker hit a car frontal in a right-hand curve despite full braking.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, the remaining three people in the car remained unharmed.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavaria's transport minister Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organiser of the Biker protests announced for August against driving bans, Gabor Kovacs, the minister referred to extensive investments such as underrun protection on guard rails and the defusing of dangerous curves.
"We have achieved a lot in recent years for the safety of motorcyclists," the letter said.
"The number of motorized two-wheeler drivers killed decreased by around 28 percent compared to 2011".
Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will be guesting with the Hessen, the former club of the Croat, on 1 August (18:00 h).
For the Bundesliga, it is the first and only hard test before the Europa League rematch against FC Basel (6 August).
Because of the Coronavirus pandemic, the encounter is held without spectators.
"We are especially looking forward to this game.
It is always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," explained Kovac.
Sporty this is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Prior to joining FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached Hessen from 2016 to 2018 and led to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the match against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac," said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croat at the Concord.
In March, the Frankfurters had lost the eight-elfinal match against Basel in their own stadium with 0–3.
Almost 50 new infections: Landkreis Hof just past the lockdown
In the county of Hof, the number of known new Corona infections on the weekend has increased further: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person is recovering and no longer falls into this statistics) to 47 on Sunday.
In addition, there is a case in the city courtyard.
Thus, the Hof area approaches the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.
700 dead due to monsoon rain in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe flooding in Southeast Asia, especially in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
Because of the heavy monsoon rain, a total of 700 people were killed.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent in boats is trying to reach the isolated people.
Whole villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Panzernashorns in National Park die from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tank rhinos died from landslides.
They are protected and considered to be at risk of extinction.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which scientists attribute to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the most hit countries by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In the town of Cox's Bazar in southern Bangladesh, the state has built housing for 650 displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm also remains in Grenezn.
Those who used to have a house were so small and like a hut, often do not want to spend their lives in a large apartment block.
Many apartments are empty, but - as the government wants - will soon be occupied by those who have lost their house due to the floods.
60 new Corona infections in just one day in Vienna

Argentina rejects counter offer of creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unjust," a statement said.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors".
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina calls on its private creditors to forego some of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If there is no agreement, the country again faces the state bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had called for higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine Government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The last inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
Experts expect economic strength to decline by around ten percent for the current year.
At the end of May, Argentina had not paid US$503 million in interest receivables and had thus slipped into a limited default.
Arrived professionally - not yet privately
"It's going super well" - Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws this conclusion after her first days at the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In the middle of May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notary office.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law took up the job, the normal day-to-day business has long been on full swing.
"However, I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely shift the food point from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
Currently she is looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
The 39-year-old explains that in order not to commute from Regensburg every day, she sometimes has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has long been known to her.
When visiting the area with her family in the past months, she then again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really nice small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her home country of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her traineeship period and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several stops as notarassessorin, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also trained "by the way" the doctorate in labour law - she took her first position as notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, eventually moving to Regensburg.
Since then she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the job in Eggenfelden had been advertised because of Lutz Feller's upcoming retirement, she saw the right time for full professional re-entry, the 39-year-old explains.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer has taken over the team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notarial office in the future - and immediately has a praise for the team of the firm ready: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-established processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
In terms of kindergarten and cribs, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging trails in the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which has to be adhered to, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel".
Usually the arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In last season's ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalisation at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal audience seats, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality area can again be opened: "It is of course a blow to the account when these revenues completely break away".
In view of the continuing Corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable side-length for the first time".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited," explained Cramer.
The Dortmund-based marketing boss praised BVB professionals for their pay cut-off, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, players know that their pay cut-off has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-time work".
Tiny miracles: early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packerl butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of around 400 early children who are cared for annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with less than a kilogram of birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers specially made for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be in voice - "and how," smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream quite as loudly as big babies".
When the Whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the St. James Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd just before the holiday began.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the theatre of the city of Aalen presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" to the pupils - and this via video.
Afterwards, the students were able to talk about the play and the performance via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias.
The idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation had been born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased about the enrichment of the class.
Even if all participants agreed at the end that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage space would offer additional attractions, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in the schools.
"If we further improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation," emphasized director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: The TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
If the TSV qualified for the DFB Cup in 1860, the lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup are determined.
The lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because due to the Corona pandemic, the field of participants is not yet complete, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary waiver of semi-final opponents FC Memmingen, TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburg kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should second-league climber Würzburg reach the final, sixty-six would already be qualified for the first round of the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final match against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will take place between 11 and 14 September and thus one week before the third league start.
"Gone by the Wind": film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
The film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died on Sunday in Paris at 104 years of natural death, confirmed her spokesperson for the German Press Agency.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the Southern epic "From the Winds Gone" (1939).
Born as a child of British parents in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as an infant.
The Austrian theatre man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of the Hermia of Shakespeare's "Summer Night's Dream".
The film studio Warner Brothers signed her for seven years and brought her out large at the side of Eroll Flynn.
Eight films she made with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (The heiress).
She also received much recognition as a neurotic eccentricist in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Pit".
Daphne du Maurier suggested her to star in the 1952 film adaptation of her novel "My Cousin Rachel".
The play became a worldwide success.
With her long-time girlfriend Bette Davis, she played in "Wiegelied für eine Körper".
Benjamin was the son of the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946–1953).
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have, however, never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss final at Comeback
Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they lost 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21) to their national team colleague Nils Ehlers and Lars Flügen in the semi-finals.
Most recently, Thole/Wickler played last September at the World Tour Final in Rome.
In the final match on the Rhine, their rivals Ehlers/Flüggen defeated surprise team Lukas Pfretchner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretchner/Milan Sievers secured the tickets.
Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "figleaf"
From the point of view of the FDP, the exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "figleaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said the FDP domestic politician Benjamin Strasser of the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of trial the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have long been excluded," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party".
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded does not say anything and does not change anything," he said to the "world on Sunday".
"It speaks rather volumes, how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD".
Blume expects the AfD to land below five percent in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD Landes and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the strönung as "secure right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD federal executive had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
He stated that Kalbitz had previously been a member of the now banned right-wing extreme "Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and had not stated it with the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing faction in the Brandenburger Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
This decision would neither weaken the federal party nor weaken the right wing.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troops is manageable.
They want to avoid further observation by the Constitutional Protection and try to get through under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD won't get rid of the ghosts she called.
A throw out doesn't change anything," commented the Brandenburg SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD Landesverband and the faction held to their right-wing leader to this day".
The legal dispute over the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court in civil law.
North Sea wind farms deliver 21 percent more electricity
Wind power plants on the German North Sea have fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet reported in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to the grid area of Tennet, have supplied another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North and Baltic Seas is thus 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy, in addition to the wind conditions, is due to higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have joined the grid over the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are currently investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot use up their capacity at sea either, but can reach about 40 percent.
The record day this year is 2 January when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, corresponding to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th anniversary.
Gmünder Kunstverein's birthday: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold burst the usual framework after the Corona break.
Much more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery, the club "Sandtogether" was involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windbergfest does not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and - knowing how difficult it is for those involved economically - we have hoped until the last minute", said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (unpartisan).
"But ultimately we are responsible here as organizers for the health of many thousands of people".
Because if tens of thousands had flowed into the festival grounds and into the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking in accordance with the current Coronaschutz regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring burden would increase disproportionately many times.
Rumberg comforted on next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - Six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg won four wins at four starts this weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also not to be beaten on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the Freestyle.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly prevailed in the Special against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen on Sunday.
Also in the Kür on Saturday on Quantaz, the Germans lay clearly ahead of their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first freestyle ever.
At the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had already won all four major competitions.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
Wormser Hochschule continues to enter the air: "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to enable the start of studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities of both the university and the DFS Air Traffic Control Academy are equally utilized.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been studying air traffic management as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students started this year.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the piloting profession.
"In these times, promotion is not easy for us economically.
However, we are confident that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the foundation professorship is a future-proofing investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, cross-professional knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue the good cooperation with the university and at the same time strengthen our attractiveness as an employer".
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's programme in Air Traffic Management".
The trust of Deutsche Flugsicherung is both a motivation and a commitment for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further develop its teaching and research expertise in the future areas of aviation.
In the use for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university could set very special highlights and innovative focal points for its students with the first foundation professorship for a dual study programme.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasises: "The Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique position in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on aviation.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the university's profile".
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
Around 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was fully closed on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, as after a traffic accident the rescue helicopter was in operation.
A 76-year-old drove straight ahead with a Ford at 12.40 p.m. at the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the bend and landed at the guardrail.
Due to the impact, the front airbags triggered, the driver suffered slight injuries on the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient was subsequently flown to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At the moment, however, the police assume that there is no danger of life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed.
Heil wants to check other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry back to light.
The law is about to be tightened up.
But are they right - and will they remain so?
Federal Labor Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to check other industries according to the now planned strict regulations against abuses in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry for the industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive Corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ external personnel during slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
To this end, the use of work contract and agency workers shall be prohibited there.
Employers president Ingo Kramer said the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction on work contracts and employee leave if you don't want to completely strangle the economy".
Works contracts, for example, are the basis for their added value at the customer for large areas of the craft, construction and plant construction industries.
"The faults of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts anywhere in the German economy".
Works contracts make sense.
"When an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a security facility, that is an entirely normal work contract".
The German meat industry considers a ban on works contracts and temporary work to be unconstitutional in its sector alone.
It is not possible to explain why, in future, different labour law should apply to portioning and packing cheese than to sausages, according to a statement on the bill, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
A ban would therefore increase the consumer price by 10 to 20 per cent per kilo per product.
According to the results of an examination by the NRW Labour Protection Administration, many Eastern European employees from works contract companies worked in the industry for 16 hours a day.
Often they had no break.
Wage was withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation with the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were bypassed by "tricky constructions".
"Now must be thoroughly cleaned up".
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we intend to adopt in the Cabinet at the end of July, measures not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher occupational health and safety testing rates or clear criteria for community accommodation".
The draft of the dpa includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Safety Act.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nunnmacher (Greens) believes that more intensive controls are needed.
"I would like us to be able to do even more checks in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, including animal transport," said Nunmacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, for more checks, more staff posts were also needed.
Three deaths in case of crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
According to the police, three people died during the crash of an ultralight plane to an apartment house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
A child was slightly injured.
Two more people had been saved injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the Wesel circuit control centre.
A parachute had been found at the scene of the accident, according to the police.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash, the plane collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were initially not known.
eviction of Frankfurter Opernplatz to go peacefully
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the eviction of the Opera Square went peacefully during the night on Sunday.
Finally, a few dozen people stayed on the square, but left it at 1:00 a.m. before the curfew began.
The police had been in operation with numerous officials since the early evening, and a larger police force was on display throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight, there was a ban on entering the opera court, where riots had occurred a week ago.
Policemen had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of people celebrating.
At least five officers were injured after police entry, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday had also remained quiet.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday around 1.25 p.m.
She was taken to the Klinikum Kassel.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire department was looking for possible passengers.
According to police, the woman was on Bundesstraße 83 in the direction of her hometown of Hümme, when her car came off the road from a previously unexplained cause and overturned several times.
In order to save the victims, the fire brigade had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether anyone else was still in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched by the rotary conductor with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered to search for people.
However, the forces did not find anyone between the high corn crops.
The severely injured were taken to the Kassel Klinikum for further care with the ambulance.
Almost 50 volunteers from the Hofgeismar fire brigade, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The federal road was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin champion in Italy
Turin - After a redemptive goal of Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the total 36th Scudetto of club history perfect with a 2-0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home match against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo hit 1-0 before halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the last long-injured former national player Sami Khedira, is no longer to be pushed out of first place two days before the end of the Serie A season.
Inter Milan is the second in the table, seven points down.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo hit with the last action after a free kick variant.
A play by Miralem Pjanic was directly used by the 35-year-old from the penalty zone limit with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2–0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This secured the unglazed, but decisive success.
In the 89th minute, the foulelfmeter shot at the latte was probably only Ronaldo himself with a view to the goal hunter rating.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very slightly," explained coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1–2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Due to the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve had the most reassuring advantage at the top of the table, mainly due to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the match on Sunday, the Sarri team had only managed five wins.
It is questionable whether Ronaldo will also become a goal scorer.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 hits on his account after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The current Juve pro Gonzalo Higuaín holds the record in Italy.
The Argentinian scored 36 goals for SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the next title chance awaits the "old lady" of Italian football.
Juventus is in the Champions League's eighth-finals, but on 7 August against Olympus Lyon has to make up for a 0–1 penalty to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to gas in countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg streets: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police have already registered more than 250 illegal car races in the southwest.
There are no comparable figures for the years before, but the racers are increasingly doing work for the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted in the public prosecutors' offices between Konstanz and Mannheim for illegal races; a year later, it was already 252 and 151 in the current year until the beginning of June.
The races were less about organised events, as the Ministry of the Interior responded to a request from the SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they had taken the run from the police - this is also indicated as an illegal race.
Especially German men aged between 18 and 60 were at the wheel.
113 fines - 15 jails
Only in comparatively few cases are the racers caught and asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been pronounced.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other motorists reacted more sensitively than before because of the many tragic accidents and trials of past years and reported more frequently, said a ministry spokesman.
The Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with racers. Drivers repeatedly slow down traffic there in order to gain space and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 riders on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit there is an attempt to brake the racers on the particularly affected section between tights and  Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and inflated sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers dodge to Germany due to the high penalties for too fast driving and car racing in the neighbouring country to the lawn.
For the SPD, the speed limit should not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport experts of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for racers would be significantly higher if you weren't supposed to be legally here and there with 200 kilometres per hour and more on the road".
Rivoir is less concerned with education or image campaigns: "Anyone who, in such a way, ignores all rules and puts not only one's own life at risk, but also the lives of other road users, is hardly attainable with reason."
ADAC calls for greater police intervention
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that Raser will not be deterred from the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and tougher controls on the routes concerned.
Not infrequently, the high-touring mass of forces has become more painful and serious: since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races nationwide, two of them in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
There, two young men are said to have made a car race in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, bounced against a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, in the view of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, sharper penalties are not necessary: "Legislative action is not seen in order to sanction illegal motor vehicle races harder," says the Ministry of the Interior's paper.
Bluelight of July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snacks
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack on Thursday in Rohrdorf, Calw County, and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road around 3.40 p.m. and ran towards the snack.
There he noticed a man who served drinks at the refrigerator and then left the snack bar through a previously slammed entrance door.
The perpetrator fled in the direction of the meadows behind the snack.
According to the police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit area.
The suspect is described as follows: It is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hooded sweater, black pants and bright shoes.
The police receive further witness notices.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Radprofi Pascal Ackermann won his second day victory on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatinate from Team Bora-hansgrohe prevailed on the 109 kilometer long section with start and finish in Hermannstadt in mass sprint, after winning a stage already on Saturday.
It was the season victories three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall ranking, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
In the morning, the 26-year-old had sovereignly decided to ride the mountain time and thus took over the top of the classification.
Only 104 riders had started the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountain time riding.
"I'm really happy to start the season new start with a win," Ackermann had explained after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the finish, he simply put on his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly".
According to the rules of the World Association UCI, a Corona test was carried out for all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the complete tour, drivers and carers were separated from the organisation team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Viewers at the start and finish were not allowed.
Head office gave instructions for lay reanimation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment house, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call arrived just before 1:00 p.m.
"A control center dispatcher immediately gave instructions for lay reanimation," said a firefighter to BILD.
The incoming rescue forces took over the revival measures a little later.
The child in danger of life was transported to the university hospital under reanimation.
Why it happened is unclear.
The police routinely started the accident investigation.
The fire officer: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unauthorized Tuning Meeting - Police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1000 people participated in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to increase control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's southern city.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to police Mittelfranken, an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße was detected by the Nuremberg Traffic Police at around 10.30 p.m.
As a result, the police carried out a variety of vehicle checks there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to step up their efforts against so-called autoposers.
Illegal Tuning Meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officials counted a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people at the top, the police reported.
However, only a small part of the participants could be associated with the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, most of the scene in question followed the police's appeal.
On the basis of the local vehicles and persons, it is to be assumed that these were mainly showy ones.
In addition, the vast majority of those present adhered to the current infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-to-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on the spot were completed at around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials found that the type-approval had expired in 10 vehicles with such structural changes.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car racing
Illegal car races did not exist.
"The police bureau of Mittelfranken will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out intensified control measures, also in connection with the emergence of spectators," he said.
The agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger about the towing company involved: "They have all the nice rims that we must not scratch," says Schrödinger.
Special ribbons would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to damage.
"After all, the young people are supposed to get their cars back safely".
Labour Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of short-time abuse
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) investigates around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time workers' money.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work," said Daniel Terzenbach, Chief Operating Officer of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, many companies had suddenly applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
Usually the test takes up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time at our disposal in this hot phase.
So we'll take a closer look at the final statements.
I'm sure there'll be a lot of things to do.
We are not naive and have a long breath".
Evidence of abuse often comes from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, BA uses analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments diverge, but we arm ourselves in the case of the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money".
The numbers are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden disbanded
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the Neue Garten.
The collection had been dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the district drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation informed on PNN request.
The young people would then have left the park.
On Saturday evening, some youths would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by district drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the foundation, accumulations occur over and over again, in which the distance and hygiene rules Covid-19-circulation regulation are not complied with.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without the Corona ordinance, the parks will be closed at nightfall.
The storage on the meadows is prohibited according to the park regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The Foundation has been complaining for some time that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
Meanwhile, illegal park parties in Berlin have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party the night after Sunday.
The event was disbanded by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular tourist town of St. Wolfgang in Upper Austria.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as announced by the regional authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected young interns are in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has also been tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism workers were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday night.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there and there" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Some guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around a third of guests are Germans.
On Friday, the first infections had become public.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the conduct of the interns who had celebrated in several locals and could have infected themselves there.
"We all liked to do this in our youth," he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of Covid-19 among young employees.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The eruption evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party village Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of corona spread throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.
More than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of the new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football recordkeeper Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
The Red Devils secured third place on the Premier League's last match day with a 2–0 (0–0) victory against direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because Chelsea FC still passed and qualified as fourth for the royal class as well.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United went in the lead by a penalty shot by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the postseason, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) hit the final score.
Chelsea, in the Champions League final opponent of FC Bayern, won in parallel 2–0 (2–0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who still passed the Wolves with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started as the sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth for himself, but had to shake for a long time at West Ham United for class maintenance.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately compensated Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which shaved three coaches in the season, descends after five first league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who couldn't save himself through a 3–1 (2:1) at Everton FC.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool FC, which has been the English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3–1 (1–1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team barely missed the points record in English football.
The best mark is held by Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) shot the match on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said goal scorer van Dijk after the match, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's gonna be hard".
In the end, the Premier League bosses are also likely to be satisfied.
Because of the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England had been interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, even a premature demolition or a performance of the remaining games on neutral ground was discussed.
Finally, however, the season could be played without any special events - however, as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Netanyahu’s head of government are getting more and more violent.
At night violent clashes have occurred.
The Israeli police violently took action in Jerusalem on the night of Sunday against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative head of government Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people had been arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld reported.
The police used, among other things, water cannons to dissolve the rally.
According to media reports, some 6000 people gathered near Netanyahu's headquarters on Saturday evening.
They protested unemployment, corruption, and Netanyahu's handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns, and called on Netanyahu to resign.
The news site "ynet" also reported that participants in a régime demonstration who supported Netanyahu had been arrested.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private mansion in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv because he was suspected of spraying pepper spray on streetside protesters from a driving car.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator had been slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, demonstrations have recently taken place against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Most recently, Netanyahu was also criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is held up with quick loosenings and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The corona crisis has severely affected the country's economy.
The unemployment rate was more than 20 percent last.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel recently rose to record levels.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhr - Bild.de
Ahlen - A drive-up accident on Saturday afternoon called for nine lightly injured on the B58 at Ahlen.
A motorist was traveling with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police: "Probably she had suddenly slowed down because she wanted to turn off".
The driver of a Mercedes transporter driving behind her must have seen this too late.
He hit the back of the car.
In the accident, three inmates in the car and six in the transporter were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea locks border town after Corona suspected case
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to ward off the coronavirus as a "illuminating success".
Now the country is reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Because of a first official corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a big city for fear of disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defence measures in the past six months, "the malignant virus could have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the state of emergency had been imposed.
The communist leadership issued the highest level of alarm.
Should the suspected case be confirmed, it would be the first official infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the sealed country.
North Korea had not previously reported a single infection and described its defensive measures as a "illuminating success".
The data were questioned abroad.
The disease symptoms were reportedly noted at a "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person had deposed to South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
For the border crossing within the four kilometers wide and mostly still mined military buffer zone there was initially no confirmation from South Korea.
However, according to reports from the Yonhap National News Agency, South Korea's military recognized the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Investigations were being carried out on some persons.
According to North Korea, an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party Politburo, chaired by Kim Jong Un, was held on Saturday on suspicion.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "block Kaesong completely and isolate each district and the region from others," he continued.
The person concerned and all people in Kaesong who had contact with her had been quarantined.
The central military commission of the party should therefore investigate the "outlier case" as well as the behaviour of the responsible military unit and impose severe punishment if necessary.
According to estimates, about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension in front of Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still for discussion before a big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the board will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale project of downtown development east," says the central section of the urban press release at the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the large hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
However, the upgrading of the eastern city in particular is controversial until the end.
The majorities for this are scarce, most recently even in individual committees, depending on their presence.
An appeal from the business community (building, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed by the administration and municipal council fail now after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponents Reinhard Klein as "out-of-parliamentary opposition", "unsuspecting", "speculation", "vilification" and "conscious false statements".
"Everybody thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list.
In fact, after reading the Treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The city's exit is cheaper, and the Technical City Hall, contrary to the city's administration's statements, is convinced of the existence of Klein for 8.5 million euros.
The city would develop in a very different way than was predicted in the town hall and by the supporters of the economy.
Designing the city by its own power and not by an investor: that is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides essentially for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the open-plan maintenance of the Schloßberg, the rental of the ex-Thales for administrative areas and a small-scale inner-city redesign in the ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health-related noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many speed reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting regular bus traffic with thinned bars and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
The agenda also includes the accession to the Baden-Württemberg climate protection pact, the re-establishment of parental contributions in the urban child day facilities and the application for admission to the federal Smart City funding.
Citizens are welcome, but they need to take corona protection measures into account.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with much delay
With almost half a year of delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his first season at the ADAC GT Masters on July 31st.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operation, the first test runs were now on.
For Zimmermann, it was primarily about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 more closely.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first mission in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener made his first laps on the Lausitzring and got used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the preseason," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the bends differently.
But it really was a lot of fun".
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Dutchman has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I get along brilliantly and we have made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring".
Right there - on the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also carry out its first race.
From July 31st, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 serial newcomers, knows the track however.
In 2015, he was last guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafener Renngemeinschaft Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally in order to be fast".
How fast carpenter is then really, that turns out in two weeks.
"The teams, of course, poke a little during the tests," he says.
"Finally, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a busy calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
At the moment, it's a stand that no viewers will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formel-1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take part in the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister coldly caught by quarantine decision
According to press reports, the British government's decision to quarantine Spain holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has coldly caught the country's transport minister.
According to this, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain of all places, while his colleagues decided on the measure at home on Saturday.
Because of the rise in Corona figures in Spain, the London cabinet removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine conditions is possible.
The new regime will apply from today, Sunday, so that Shapps will also have to be quarantined after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are only on leave on the deadline, only from Saturday, August 1st, and was not introduced overnight.
In Austria, by the way, Spain is still considered to be one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility of quarantine being imposed on holidaymakers Spain," Labour MP Diane Abbot commented.
"But apparently no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapps".
Nearly one month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the end of the severe curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists mainly blame nightlife for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the British's favorite holiday destinations.
The British Government is currently recommending non-necessary travel to mainland Spain, with the exception of the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular among British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Day of the Navy: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on the day of the Navy in his country that he would equip warships with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons, unique in the world, the fighting possibilities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
The Ministry of Defence also informed Interfax about successful tests of the Zircon hypersonic missile built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of around 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo continues to be built
It was also said to be built on the atomically inflatable underwater torpedo Poseidon.
The planned sea drone is planned for the destruction of coastal targets.
The president, who himself also sailed by military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service by the individual fleet associations of the largest country in the world.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been reliably protecting Russia, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
In many other Russian coastal places, the naval forces also carried out parades on the day of the navy.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated at a gun show in the Mediterranean port of Tartu's strength.
Ammunition was also fired there.
Not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets, were featured in a video published by the Ministry of Defense.
Hurricane "Hanna" Reaches Texas: Help Difficult Because of Corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season across the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life-threatening flooding, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. Climate Agency NOAA reported in the night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared the emergency state for numerous districts.
The Corona pandemic that is rampant in Texas is making the work of the helpers more difficult, Abbott said, according to the U.S. media.
Evacuated Called to Caution
"Every hurricane is an enormous challenge," said Abbott, according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle".
Looking at the cyclone in Texas, he added, "This challenge is complicated and is being exacerbated, considering that it sweeps through an area that is the most affected by Covid-19 territory in the state".
According to Johns Hopkins University, around 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
They should not disregard practices "that we have become accustomed to," such as wearing masks, said the governor according to the CBS station.
It was important that everyone kept their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, emergency shelters should be tested on Corona.
Damage had initially only been reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn again
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour, according to authorities, "Hanna" was hit on land on the island of Padre Island just off the Texas coast.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest tier one hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning had first been issued and later taken back.
Authorities expected a weakening, while "Hanna" moved further inland and headed toward the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was heading towards Hawaii at wind speeds of about 150 kilometres per hour during the night on Sunday.
However, the Hurricane Center expected it to continue to weaken.
According to the prediction, it is said to be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average hurricane season this year, according to a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could become very strong cyclones, the authority had declared.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
In view of available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, which of an under-average even only ten percent, it was said at the time.
US President Donald Trump wrote via Twitter that his government was watching the storms closely and in contact with the affected states.
Four goals cancelled: video assistant "punishment" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic were denied two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals cancelled: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a rabid black evening in the 0:2 (0:1) at SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really mad at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of ungiven goals for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so tough against a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Host Naples had gone through a goal of outside defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute in the lead, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic first cheered the balance.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the hit back due to a side position.
Five minutes later, Djuric again shot the ball into the net - again the VAR intervened.
Also the goals of attackers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) took back the referee team according to the VAR.
In the postseason, Allan made the 2-0 final score for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology creates records," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern München: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League started with a setback for double champion FC Bayern.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick "somehow well" has to consider how he can rebuild his successful defence after the injury of World Champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who, behind Captain Manuel Neuer and Mittelfeldchef Joshua Kimmich, has the third most use minutes, suffered a band injury at the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive King-class duels.
In the Munich Schmuddelwetter, the right-wing defender broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
The 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament, which starts in Lisbon on 12 August, to be played in the eight-elfinal back match against Chelsea FC on 8 August.
The Bavarians do not want to be stopped by the mishap from the training on Sunday.
Flick named in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on his way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are intended to show his victorious title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the King's Class Endgame on 23 August.
"We simply mastered the compulsory tasks with championship and cup excellently.
Now it's time to create something special," Flick said.
Until the Munich final tournament and a training camp in the Algarve are able to deal specifically, however, the eight-elfinal challenge against FC Chelsea is due first.
After the 3–0 in the first round before the Corona break, the Londoners were not to become a Bayern nightmare again in the home arena as in the lost "Finale dahoam" 2012.
"We have to walk through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and fill trust with a good game," Flick demanded.
A match test is due on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn in his stars, who had 13 days off after the Double, on a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players on Säbener Straße, including the new players around Edel-Einkauf Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all the new ones, has been well inserted," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. are no longer allowed to train, Flick would much rather talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, they are now trained in team strength for the Londoners, who are in the game rhythm in contrast to the Flick ensemble.
After that, the Munichs could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the finale in Lisbon "is not that easy", stressed the head coach, who can trust in the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday onwards.
The World Cup record scorer Klose and Flick know of so many common tournament preparation, which is particularly important with the 0 to 100 tuning.
With his current team, working was "a pleasure," Flick praised.
The "focus on winnings" is an impressive feature of his team.
The tournament with nine-man teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
Of the performers, all were present, including Thiago, who is willing to emigrate and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts are not secured beyond the King-class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise to award the World Cup titles.
However, all the American races were cancelled.
Racing calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula One season continues to take shape.
Three more races were added to the ten confirmed Grand Prix during the week.
In October, the race will be held at the Nürburgring in Germany and Portimão in Portugal.
On November 1, Lewis Hamilton and Co. battle for World Cup points on the Italian traditional race track in Imola.
This means that the 2020 racing calendar currently includes 13 runs.
"We are pleased to continue to make great progress in the completion of our 2020 season plans," said Formula 1 boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the top class of motorsport will be completed in this exceptional season.
The Formula One team wants to finish their season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, which have already been officially planned, media reports suggest that there could still be performances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulations demands races on three continents
The rules of Formula 1 require at least races on three continents for the award of the World Cup.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there should be a world champion.
By means of a special rule, the FIA intends to award the titles citing "extraordinary circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional season start in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the upcoming Corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Refusal meets criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense Corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being with them again next season," Carey explained.
The rejection of the America races met with criticism, especially in Brazil: "The rejection did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
The number of infections in the São Paulo region was significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Moreover, the concerns of some teams about not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify rejection.
They were prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad look against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known latenight show via video and revealed in the interview what she had in her mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular US latenight show via video.
Among other things, she told of her struggle against the powerful in the world.
The teenage girl also talked about her famous "bad look" at her meeting with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latenight show about her plans in the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday on your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish.
She talked not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children goes out on the street" she has experienced.
Heads of state and leading politicians, who mock them in social media or even try to silence them, find them "funny" as they show the reactions "since they have no other answer to them".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was approached to a well-known scene, in which she cast US President Trump a bitter look after her.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the nude woman sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive view was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip created a GIF, i.e. an animated image that eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the American president at that moment?
She answered the relatively frank question of Stephen Colbert briefly undryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation".
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the quick answer and disappeared from the picture laughing for a short time.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she remained in the memory of many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder immobilier with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe right up with Bayern's Robert Lewandowski.
Former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile continues to have best chances of becoming goal scorer king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB pro scored three goals in the 5–1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two turned penalty points in the postseason seasons of both halves.
The 30-year-old now has 34 goals in his account from the fourth-placed two seasons before the end - just as many were scored by Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar meets Sampdoria Genoa with the lead in the evening.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Now the blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He had died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members announced on Saturday in an official statement, another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton recognized Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" for all previous and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in 1967 in London, until today his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the group's profits for charitable purposes.
He began to perform in wide robes and with large crucifix.
Mental problems are also said to have played a role.
Three years after the band was founded, Green left the band in 1970.
A social descent followed.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the street for a while, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a while in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in the Bethnal Green district of London.
At an early age, he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing the guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to be a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners on stage.
A little later, he was hired by the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the Blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 along with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its dark side: Green could not cope with the media fuss, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green surprisingly achieved a respectable success with an album inspired by religious themes in 1979.
Fleetwood Mac swam on a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green didn't make a big comeback until 1996 when he started again with a group of friendly musicians.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star returning to Earth.
Free of drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
