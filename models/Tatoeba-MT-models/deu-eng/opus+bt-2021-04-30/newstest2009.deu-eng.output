The Prague Stock Exchange falls into minus by close of business.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal day-to-day business.
At the beginning of Tuesday's business, the Prague Stock Exchange began to break down on Monday, when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time the reason for the burglary was Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the market's response to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there, is evident.
Case of shares in Asia
On Tuesday, stocks on the Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index lost almost four percentage points over the course of the business day, but was later able to offset some of the losses, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which observes the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange decreased by 3.6 percent according to the index there.
"The timing for the bailout in the US is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and pass the bill for financial support.
Otherwise, it would threaten that other countries would also be affected by the burglary.
A Bloodbath of American Stocks
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to $700 billion (almost Kč 12 trillion) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's request to support the plan.
Bush's view that the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilise the entire economy.
American stocks were going through a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the biggest slump in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, a similar slump he had most recently recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was hardly any indication that the draft would not get through in the House of Deputies, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes concession: US government allowed to pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance to the American financial system.
This will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
American legislators made a breakthrough in talks about the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of financial assistance to the American financial system to the tune of $700 billion (about $12 trillion).
However, this does not yet mean a victory.
In fact, Congressmen still need to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in American Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the Chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
In the Senate, according to different data, it is likely that the plan could be voted on at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first major psychological factor in stimulating financial markets.
After that, however, there would be a "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms, as one could also help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a market stabilisation package should look like," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the agency Bloomberg.
According to her, a final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with American Secretary of State Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets from financial companies, which plunge the financial firms into heavy losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We need to continue the recovery plan, but I think we're at the end of the process," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
The aim was to reassure investors of the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a decision by the Congress could influence the business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is also confusion as to whether the negotiations could still fail at the last minute due to a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
But the law will undergo some changes.
The total amount earmarked for assistance to the system will be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
But Congress can block the payout of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not perform its function, at a further $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush views progress in negotiations as positive
Although the president has a right of veto in this decision, Congress may overrule its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has persisted, based on obtaining finance for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, the Senate then on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His spokesman Tony Fratto stated that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and "estimated the bilateral effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate, Christopher Dodd, the senior negotiator, stated that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money program, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies involved in the programme and sets up a committee to oversee the fund.
This is to be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and achieved a great advance towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new mortgage rates that it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"It is because one does not know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses among each other," Marek said this week to the server iHNed.cz.
According to Marek, whether the plan will be adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not decisive.
"It is much more important that Congressmen agree to support the plan and say goodbye to it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that it will be adopted is the most important thing at this moment," Marek stressed.
Duel on Messer's cutting edge: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls yet.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to buy just one phone.
Nevertheless, there are enough reasons why you should get an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
Sure, it's hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues on your shelf, you probably dream of at least one of them.
This is also the case with music on travel, i.e. with compressed music, expressed in a simplified way - music in MP3 format.
Again, there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but a Pink-Floyd fan will also be hard to take headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do doesn't even make a hint.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, calling and simsing, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better camera, sometimes a worse camera and may also be able to navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy eaters.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten-twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
That's why you should expect cheap phones to be able to play music for no longer than a few hours.
If you then call from time to time, you prefer to buy a charger for the office - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good will last at least 9 hours uninterrupted operation with one time charging out.
Another problem is if you want to play the music on your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB connection, besides, not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, the music can be transferred directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers can handle the tiny memory cards used in cell phones without reduction.
With players you do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, ordered by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can be more
When choosing a specific device, you should in particular check for the battery life, storage capacity, quality and type of sound and of course also for ease of use.
If music is especially a backdrop for you and if you listen to it every day only briefly, for example in the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is sufficient.
Which almost every cell phone can do.
You also don't have to check which music formats a mobile phone or player can process.
MP3 will create all, and most of the music you get will just be in this format.
The format is one of the most widely used, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also allow you to buy music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can in itself be a striking argument for why you should get a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is bad and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of music sales (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry the phone with them.
If you feel like listening to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can access the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only the few MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of the music phones will be in the price for many.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand kroner.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players is the easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - players can really be used by everyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity when operating with the former normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no threat of a collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horrendous invoice for data transmissions.
Which device should be used now
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g.Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are sufficient.
But respect.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can read 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to place more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be among the more demanding listeners, prefer to take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have stand-alone control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use comes to that of a single MP3 player.
The furthest is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman mobile phones have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) provide MP3 players from the above mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe he won't be waiting long.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that Czech mobile operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of a text message is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the European Commission's final steps in regulating roaming charges, it is likely that there will be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a battle announcement.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, because in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain that there is an extremely high level of competition on the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák often agrees with this, who had often said in the past that there was no place for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has much chance (by the way, it would probably hardly find frequencies).
But there is one more possibility - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market brought with it a significant price reduction, to which then also the classical mobile operators had to react.
Even before such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, there were similar voices to those in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, it doesn't take long to look for examples.
In February we reported about the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider succeeded in attracting more than 100 thousand customers, making it the fifth largest provider in the country.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns, among other things, U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to be able to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually stand out as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to focus on a non-clichetic target group.
This provider is specifically targeted at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and whom they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could also gain a foothold in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone Miroslav Čepický's press officer also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of service provision."
In the Czech Republic, the mobile operators believe that there is no chance
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
Mobilking will be more likely to enter the market in other countries in our region," says Jana Studničková, spokesman of the Penta financial group, in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor arises.
Their interest in launching a virtual mobile provider has been shown for some time by the GTS Novera group, which wants to take a further step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the corporate clients sector.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-line, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already achieved progress in the negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl, press officer.
Maybe better times are coming.
Unofficial information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specificities over other markets.
No subject has yet addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sršeň from Telefónica O2's press department in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other suppliers also point to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile press officer Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build on."
And she adds: "In the network of T-Mobile, hardly any virtual provider will appear by the end of the year.
At this moment, we should already have a concrete offer in order to be able to think in the short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický comments: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure sharing.
This is exactly what we consider the best from the customers' point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider means more competition, this would lead to lower prices and thus also to a decline in profits.
So why should such a competitor be made easier to enter the market?
The fact that providers can pull together when it comes to something also proves the long back and forth about the emergence of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards ČTÚ was at the time when U:fon came on the market from the company T-Mobile.
This is also demonstrated by the publicly available information from the ČTÚ websites.
Now, however, U:fon is a good argument as to why you shouldn't allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, on its services."
However, given this approach of mobile operators, the absolute lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of ČTÚ, which unfortunately - unlike Great Britain and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
The latter holds only the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, applied to this whole problem its very typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile provider and a virtual provider via the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classical suppliers," said Kristián Chalupa of the External Relations Department of the ÚOHS in his reply to our request.
Such a formulation would not surprise representatives of suppliers.
This is more than worrying by an authority that represents consumer interests and, among other things, that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outside the country, where virtual providers work quite normally, it can be observed that their market entry has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not part of the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, the almost touching harmony of the three mobile operators resulting from their reactions is really shocking.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same petrol price at the petrol stations is surely just coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs of anti-competitive action in this matter, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the suppliers have a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The regulatory authority for telecommunications is also likely to lack the necessary tools to open up the mobile market to virtual providers," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the approval of the network operator is always necessary for the market entry of a virtual provider.
And, logically, the mobile provider has a monopoly on its network.
This means that it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a particular segment.
Even if you do not go along with this argument, it should at least be a warning to the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are strikingly similar.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The transfer of responsibility to the ČTÚ is then a quite common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This was already observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, it has not been possible to introduce the extension of ČTÚ's competences to the area of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's all right when no one's looking
First of all, the functioning of any pseudo-virtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
It is companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but are only partially public.
Usually they are companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Our own mobile telephone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar kind of resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, it may be a violation of the contractual terms that we will then deal with, which may lead to an end to the cooperation with the relevant company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
It is, however, quite unlikely that such a thing will not be heard by those in charge of the mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, there may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such an approach.
In fact, these companies are not subject to negligible profits, but at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite all the services of these companies are used only by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone doesn't run on their name, so they can't have it in full like the normal customers of mobile providers."
But the ČTÚ should at least seem strange.
A further question opens up for the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an approach, why are they blocking a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competencies to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the statement of the providers that they do not know about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been stressed several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers resulted in a significant drop in the price of the various services.
In practically all countries where virtual providers have been created, the classic providers have tried to prevent their creation more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market which was too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, it was precisely at this moment that the regulatory bodies intervened, which did not seek to protect the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Be it through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator emerged, and this was followed by more.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing up the whole case like a hot potato.
On the basis of our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in competences is more than favourable in these cases.
But let's not throw the shotgun in the corn.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon start moving again.
If a provider permits the emergence of a virtual mobile provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally not make more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new photos of the national anthem Wo ist my home country on the occasion of the Day of Czech Statehood in a ceremony.
The anthem was re-recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choir version and in an instrumental version.
The vocal version was taken over by Kateřina Knková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already told the Czech radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices for the solo variants, which are striking and popular.
"From the very beginning, I tried with both and then with the choir to adhere to a clear diction so that one can understand the text well, so that a harmony can be created," the conductor said.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov můj" was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Ständetheater in the originally Czech play "Fidlovačka" by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first verse of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound?
The Prague transport companies will also transport on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague's transport companies as a date when the first passengers who carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket will enter a subway, tram or bus.
They can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and play it on their chip card at the same time, in the information centers and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraşı Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons are also available on the Internet since yesterday on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use Internet sales can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long queues for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon on the Internet, it is played on the opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"There is also a desk with trained staff at these places, which advises interested parties when purchasing the Internet and also places the coupon on the map," said the speaker of the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on the opencard on self-service machines, which are installed in some underground vestibules.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, remind of ticket devaluers, passengers may have noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty," adds Opatrný.
Controlling the coupon instead of the driver
The operation of the vending machines, which will work from tomorrow, is easy.
All you have to do is insert the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon plays itself.
From tomorrow, the electronic coupons will apply not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which especially the inhabitants from communities of the region of central Bohemia reach the capital.
"In the trains that are part of Prague's integrated traffic, train attendants have readers that allow them to check the validity of coupons by time and by zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid organisation, explaining ticket control. This organisation compiles the schedules for Prague's transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the driver's ticket office.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the opencard must be placed in a marked position at the side of the checkout.
The driver controls the validity of the coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the issued coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who does not drive suburban buses and no longer knows when the coupon expires can in turn go to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information about the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the United States
The Sudeten Germans had requested the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States in 1945.
This is evident from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the U.S. President in 1945.
This can be seen, among other things, from a letter which has been preserved in a private archive and which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
In the letter, the Germans of Krumau ask the American President not to allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says a letter signed with the words "people to whom the fate of the Sudeten lies at their heart."
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia leads the Sudeten Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - to suspect that they would expect brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection of the Bohemian Forest for the present and forever.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are a candidate for a state that is foreign to us, which is trying to suppress and eliminate minorities and has done nothing to contribute to the victory of the Allies," the letter says.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge lusts of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. President has doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it is sufficient for him to initiate a referendum in the Bohemian Forest Valley on whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the U.S. or live under the protective rule of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, according to some contemporary witnesses, however, it draws a good picture of the Sudeten Germans' expectations at the time.
Even if the Bohemian Germans at least had to suspect that they would negotiate their deportation from the republic, only a few of them accepted such a possibility at all.
Some waited for the United States and Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed that they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was assigned to the Navy on the Baltic Sea during the war as a German Budweiser.
When he came into British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens more Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would fit them," said Chalupa.
In his opinion, none of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected him to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think - then pay!
An emotion-packed campaign is aimed at drivers
Expensive action for safety on the streets in Czech history.
This could also characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport is planning to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Řebšťek's office promises to dissuade drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to drive drivers from too fast driving mode and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remind each other to strap up before the start of the journey.
The campaign is aimed primarily at young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also shown by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are written in capital letters on a license plate.
And in a pool of blood the word "pay" is then written.
This means that you can pay for a moment of inattentiveness with your own life.
The spots will "shock" viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can normally see pictures with drastic shots of accident victims.
It is expected that this will reduce the number of accidents and fatalities on Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Carrots and whips for drivers
"For the drivers, the motto is carrot and whip.
Carrot means that if they drive red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," said the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, tablets that alert drivers to a danger are even less effective.
"If you put up a static plaque that warns of a danger, it will probably soon melt into the environment, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert spoke out in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordanland, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace could be made in exchange for this with Palestine and Syria.
He emphasized this in an interview printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Akronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it becomes necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We retain a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to cede to the Palestinians a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He acknowledged that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants safety in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to renounce part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in allusion to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple keeper and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the old town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Deduction from the Golan Heights
Olmert advocated the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which he felt was an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert affirmed.
"The Syrians know only too well what they have to do without in order to get the Golan heights back.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister specified.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards illegal on the bus?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance bus the running around is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a Student Agency bus near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travellers are allowed to walk back and forth on the bus while driving.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is in contradiction to the law on road transport," said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the way for the bus.
The young woman was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place in the car at this moment, although she had two more seats available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply at the moment when the steward carries coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is also equipped with standing spaces according to the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided for on the bus, travellers must sit.
Student Agency long-distance buses do not have standing places, as confirmed by the director of the company, Radim Jančura, opposite Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and this first did not agree with the movement of travellers.
Later this was withdrawn, and we reached a consensus that travellers may go to the toilet while driving if they have their seat," he said.
The law knows no steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of car attendants, but it does not define their rights and obligations," adds the spokesman of the Hanzelka Ministry.
The director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law covers this issue subsequently.
"It depends on whether the bus also has standing spaces in product approval.
That's all then," he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing places and a higher permitted speed and long-distance buses without standing places with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like on the plane, says the expert
The BESIP expert for road safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"With a liquid mode of driving, not many dangers threaten, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Again, it is not safe when turbulence comes, and the stewardess can bump his head."
"However, if a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tram.
The carrier must clarify the safety of the stewards by means of internal regulations," he says, and also believes that this issue is not fully resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company offering services from stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this capacity.
The director does not consider his job to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the job of the steward is risky, I will cancel it.
Guests can get coffee and newspapers while boarding.
This would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin explains the absence of stewards on his buses. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, we've been fighting it from the start.
Sooner or later this ends with some fatal accident," he had said for Týden.cz less than a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy
In the accident of a regular bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region had crashed, who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck had probably turned off the platform without blinking and had blocked the bus's journey.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
Jančura denies that the two seats were sold for the stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for long distance connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but it will also expect financial compensation from the guilty party.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring a legal regulation on which a thirty-member expert team of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"This, however, has not yet reached any concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the top speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones while driving," said Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards to be something that could significantly endanger the safety of travellers," says Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses being within the competence of the police and the health and safety authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB Executive Board to the employees of the company does not lack great words.
A merger of units of the Düsseldorf Institute of Finance with the Frankfurt Deka Bank could create "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe", according to the letter that became known on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the Landesbanken sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult time.
Because the WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalian state government recently made clear that it was time to find a solution for the future.
However, there has been talk of a connection between the Deka bank, which is known to savings bank customers because of their investment funds, and WestLB for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side.
While Deka-Bank chief Franz Waas was aware of the half-yearly figures at the end of August, he saw no point in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a state bank, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, which is each supported by half of the Landesbanken and the Sparkassenverbanden, has instructed the Board to hold discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
Of course, the talks have only just begun, according to the financial centre.
Deka Bank, one of the more important employers in the Frankfurt financial centre with its 3,000 employees, is not mentioned for the first time when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
For a moment in 2003, it looked like Deka Bank could merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, this covenant of three became nothing.
As soon as the plans had become public, the Hessian state government opposed Helaba's participation in the plan.
Also the other two houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead went to Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been thought games about a connection of the Deka bank with Landesbanken.
Most recently, however, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, had spoken out against planning games about going together with his house.
Regardless of this, however, the realization seems to mature that a merger of the various public-law sector houses is in need.
Now that the Landtag election in Bavaria is over, a connection between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first step.
This is not necessarily good news for the Helaba.
Should the pressure for further mergers increase, the partners will gradually assume responsibility for this.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has been through the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 85 percent stake in Helaba, put a stop to a merger with West LB at the beginning of the year.
At best, the North LB would remain.
But such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June Merl stated that the decisive question with which business model the future viability of the Landesbanks should be ensured had not been answered by the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end there could also be a dissection of the West LB, which, of course, is not wanted there.
In the letter from the Board of Directors there, it is also said that a "total solution" for the house is definitely being sought.
How this can be reconciled with the merging of individual units with the Deka bank will still be shown.
The second Wiesn weekend is known as the "Italian weekend"
It's the first time for Elena, the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, in the five-litre beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bear tiger and proves the 200 Oktoberfest guests, what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking space next to Puorta Nuova station, on this evening at 23:45, four buses start, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival expected 6.30 am.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, only Brazilians travel on a bus.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says it's not for Italians.
Marco, wearing a long coat with imitation fur lining and glasses with wide silver temples, belong to the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the meadow, back at 10.30 p.m.
Spending the night would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed according to the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco visited a language course in Frankfurt - inclusive.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon it will be quiet on the bus, the travellers sleep.
All right, they're gonna need their powers.
The station is located in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian license plates take another break on the motorway 8 just before Munich.
When Marcos group finally arrives at half past seven in the morning in the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On it stands "Oktoberfest", in Fraktur, next to it the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors to the beer tent open, it's called running!", Marco calls into the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not at the front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, spread in the room!"
The measure, Marco roars, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget to tip.
"Sicherheitsleuteln show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they'll be gone!"
Third, "Return to the 11th point tonight!" Understand?
And we're going to the meadow.
On the way, a yellow cap binds as waymarks to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be prepared for retreat.
It is the second Wiesn weekend, known as the "Italian weekend".
There is no exact data on figures; 50 000 people are on their way across the Alps and fall into the beer tents; ten percent of all visitors are said to have arrived from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police force is strengthened by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which carries out a nation statistics in which the Italians take first place before the British (about 60 operations) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical care.
The Hofbräuzelt is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relatively" and that the German banking sector is not spared from the crisis-ridden developments.
Because that has now occurred on the weekend.
The Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE) listed in the Dax receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate had to pay only the part it also claimed.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses at the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has lent money, the state financier had refinanced himself extremely in the short term - which is no longer possible due to distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had decreased by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also fallen slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial operations fell to zero compared to the same period last year, income from attributions to receivables and certain securities as well as from the resolution of provisions in the lending business fell by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher revenues from refunds of downstream clearing costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest under the Tax Code and from the business care for Group companies, had the earnings shortfall still moderated at around 16 percent.
The former state financier had initially speculated with commercial real estate loans after his privatisation in 1990, which had then been dissociated at Aareal Bank.
Because the traditional state financing was too low, the Depfa had become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects by private investors and the state (private-public partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter, Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations, which will have an "essential material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is quite indeterminate.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
It had already been cut by two thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the Depfa takeover.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing on the interbank market as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks has largely dried up again, as the banks hoard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funding for some of the Depfa's credit portfolio, around 50 billion euros, each year.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing needs are covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is shielded from "the influence of the currently largely inefficient international money markets".
From other sources it can be heard that thanks to the funds, the refinancing will be secured by the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke stated that, on the other hand, Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
This is to be hoped for by shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
In fact, it is not unthinkable that the funding does not have to be used in full.
But the opposite is not to be taken into account either.
After the bank was still insolvent on late Sunday evening, the rescue at least for the time being cannot calm the mood.
The share price breaks by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, bond prices are fairly good.
If the primary debt was hardly moved, the prices of the subordinated bonds would fall more sharply.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are affected and understandably the maturity beyond 2009.
If hypo-real estate bonds previously seem to be a speculative investment alternative, their value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant intensification of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which, with the takeover of the Depfa, had only brought the crisis into the house.
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable commercial banks are still willing to support the system, it can be assumed that pensions will be repaid on time.
Or there is what hardly anyone dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports that overlap with partial nationalisation, the probability of security has only become a legitimate hope at the moment.
This should especially prepare long-term believers for some sleepless nights with the decision whether they should part with their engagements.
Short-term investors can nevertheless use a closing line to form a loss carry forward for the future settlement tax payments on exchange rate gains of later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana Highschool, the girls start giggling: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells of Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before I left school, I had some babbles.
I live at the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of lessons at the Tachibana does not seem to be as strict as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students enter from eight o'clock until a short meeting with the teacher begins at twenty o'clock before nine o'clock, the 'home room'.
But before class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
And I'm not the kind of guy who likes to talk in front of people, even in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I put on my guest mother's old skirt, blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the desk and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and have a week's birthday.
At that moment I was very glad that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all snuggled, giggled and waved and constantly I heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the survival-important vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cuttle, sweet'.
Then I quickly went to my place.
The girl next to me grinned pretty broad, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really stunned.
Everyone talked confused and giggled and asked me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their Bentos.
My guest mother had also made me such a lunchbox - that's something different than the boring German break sandwiches.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in tofu coat.
Mostly, I don't know what exactly I'm eating here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It's clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which she then creates especially artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during the break snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm curious to see if I can watch this, too.
'Why Japan of all people?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
"Because I'm fascinated."
After all, I've been reading mangas for years.
And so that I can understand the comics and the culture in them better, I started learning a little Japanese at some point.
So it was perfectly clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
Because I also have a passion for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're very important here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach flees in case of danger means that it also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Only how could they feel the same if they behave in a way similar to ours?
The Internet magazine " Edge" has been publishing contributions from famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, at least we can hope because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and raise questions of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter impenetrable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it turns itself in, flees, or attacks.
Humans behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe in that, though.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in short-term memory and execution/control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in man than in the rest of the primates and seems to be completely absent from other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, however it may be, may differ greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness might look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor analysed on the basis of our own experience, because of the special hardware, then his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, which should be more easily accessible scientifically.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their content, and this is exactly what is happening in studies of the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one shifts rather to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the emergence of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I attribute it to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its own activity conscious brain.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) proves memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that distinguish primates and, in particular, humans.
Connected with linguistic nature, there are fine gradations of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar we can differentiate and categorize states in order to attribute them to others as well as ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations arise from more primitive activities in the body-feeling regions of the cortex and brain stem similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, concentrates more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in cross-generation sensations.
In theory, I cannot disagree with this, but I think it is unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans probably also feels this way in both cases: How, however, can rats and humans be verified to feel the same if they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees at risk whether she too feels fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioral resemblance cannot yet prove an equal experience.
The neural comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain strains, while cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove that for humans, how did you want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and speech), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is being made at the neural level, provided that the same is being measured in rats and humans.
How I don't study language and consciousness in rats, or feelings, I don't know if they exist.
You might think it's shortsighted, but I'd rather go forward than walk against a wall all the time.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or conversion of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts lag behind.
The number of EM stages may even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at top speed," said Ukrainian Association President Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep a constant eye on us."
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee following numerous scandals and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that preparation for the 2012 EM will not suffer from this."
Several first league teams had been sentenced to forced descent for manipulation alone last season, after which even the league start had to be postponed in the short term.
Indignant Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about private things in the interview - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her lost Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
It foams - and strikes back.
Late rose war with the ex-marriage Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an ugly argument with each other - in public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview with the U.S. journal InStyle last week, first commented on the reasons for the marriage's failure: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud had only been found out after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Unbelievable" was it, the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News" said that "Meg is repeatedly cuddling and condensing the history of our relationship".
It is also "deplorable" that the common 16-year-old son Jack is again "remembered publicly of the pain and upheavals that mean a divorce for each child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
And so his admissions close with the blow of the side: "At least my life goes on.
I am happy that I have a wonderful family that is doing well."
Prices for airline tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, flights even became up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a significant slump in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, the overnight stays have already become cheaper in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed still rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
However, prices were already 3.6 percent lower from April to June than in the previous year.
The trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is American Express's weak dollar rate, which has led to a "decreasing travel desire of American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
The trend in air fares in the first quarter also showed an upward trend:
Due to fuel-intensive long-haul flights, passengers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy-class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but price changes in the business and first class were much lower.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, prices have even halved on German domestic flights.
The reason for the price drop is on the one hand the declining economic growth, explains the company.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is crumbling.
On the other hand, the open skis agreement, which liberalises air transport between the US and Europe, has increased competitive pressure.
The tense situation was marked by the cancellation of unprofitable routes by airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, these were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1-0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes a table leader.
At Borussia Luhukay continues to fail to find a functioning eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein enlarge crash landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into play late and failed with a lift to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, it was convincingly over his lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger hissed in the cabin passage of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them were back in their seats.
Rieger was a physical therapist of HSV for almost three decades, he enjoys a higher reputation than many past actors.
And so his request also found hearing in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
Its command will have been similar: give me gate two!
Implementation did not take place.
"It wasn't all nice to look at today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt, too, would have "wanted it more relaxed".
The 1-0 (1:0) was due to the headball hit of Mladen Petric (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," summarised Martin Jol.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which pointed out their club as a class primary.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify it," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular intermediate testimony stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late-commitments - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goal scorer Petric as well as the Jansen recruited from FC Bayern - find themselves slowly, but she is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," Jol demanded.
After the defeat of the vote
On Wall Street, fear is going around.
First news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to break in by 700 points for a while.
That was the biggest loss of points in one day in his history.
Later, the Dow caught up again.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer, with a good five percent in the minus, was listed at 10,579 counters.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was 1548 points, with more than seven percent in the minus.
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which lost just under 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around twelve percent.
No title could be added.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs fell by just under ten percent.
Only a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
Under the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called rotten mortgage securities.
But the sum is not to be paid out at one stroke, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive stock option notes from the financial companies that could be redeemed if price developments were to occur in order to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the USA
The billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the United States does not remedy investors' doubts.
The share price of the German major bank Hypo Real Estate crashes and rips the Dax down.

Dark Matter Influences Flight of Space Probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has caused perplexity: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein might not be quite correct.
The spacecraft "Ulysses" flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of soon freezing fuel lines, she is now threatened with cold death.
Among scientists, for years a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion - the swing-by-anomalism.
The swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space probes, in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
However, what has been surprising to the researchers for years: the missiles do not behave 100 percent as one would expect under the venerable law of gravitation.
Rather, irregularities occur at the rate of speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, might not be quite correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is obviously an attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, that is, it does not send and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, dark matter accounts for a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their hijackers, the tourists deported in Egypt are said to be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The hijackers from Sudan had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six hostage-takers were reportedly killed in a shootout prior to release.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already under way.
Again and again Germans are targeted by kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists deported in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media in agreement.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports from the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed.
We're just checking her state of health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian woman, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, were safe and sound, reports Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for a shooting before the hostages were released remain unclear: According to an Egyptian security officer, the hijackers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the hijackers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the official.
It was "only about receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the hijackers and arrested two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife to one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the hijackers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be held until the hijackers have a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "leaded to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather caused a woman to kill herself, was reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after confessing eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court learned that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession, "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her up and blindfolded her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was gone to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who worked for the National Trust on a voluntary basis for a large part of her time, was persecuted by abuse inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been an avid surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "had given up her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself by means of a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended like this: "I used to tie her up and blindfold her eyes."
"I didn't force her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise, "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrifying for your victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it had not done so."
He added: "I note the impact, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials in charge of lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Act".
The man was seconded from the Department of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You thought this would be dealt with internally by the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned is charged according to paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause dealing with the safe retention of information.
The Royal Prosecutor recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he misplaced included classified assessments of al-Qaeda and the capacities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies face B&B costs
British housing companies could cost more than £80 million after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided £14 billion to protect Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers' deposits.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "unacceptable" that the companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are repaid.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is credited each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies would have to pay about 18% of the costs together.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to raise £81 million for the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, the Director General of the Association of Housing Companies, informed the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the real estate upturn are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
As construction companies are bilateral organisations without partners, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk will cost five pence per litre
The people of Jersey are faced with paying more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday onwards.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations have been carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, Jersey Milk's wholesale market price changed most recently in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning that she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Their defenders said that the court denied bail on the charge of having extorted 50 million Taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several pending charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government first grant her full freedom.
The correspondents say that although her detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the course of her release whether she will be able to remain at large if she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers state that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says she does not have to get bail because she is already on detention leave abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a legal complaint against the upper court."
Their lawyers apply that they need bail to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the December elections.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after 17 October, said an Awami Alliance party leader on Sunday.
She was imprisoned last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears of the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan has not vaccinated nearly 200 000 children because of the violence associated with the Taliban.
The United Nations conducted a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesperson, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or hinder thousands of immunization workers.
BskyB loses lawsuit in the ITV case
BskyB has lost its lawsuit against the Competition Commission's decision to reduce its share of the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeals Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that BskyB's stake distorted competition and allowed it an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully stopping NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB's purchase of the stake in ITV was in doubt about the independence of ITV, which prompted the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom Communications Department have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced that it would give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. prosecutor's affair
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the dismissal of the nine prosecutors in the U.S. in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice criticizing the actions of the administration staff.
The report criticised White House officials, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special Investigator Nora Dannehy is now asked to clarify whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to obstruct the judiciary.
Serious allegations, including criminal action, have not been fully investigated or clarified, said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the authority to force witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice removed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry argued that prosecutors would be dismissed due to weak work performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which prompted many observers to regard the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others had refused to investigate the Democrats' allegations of electoral fraud.
US prosecutors are charged with investigating and pursuing judicial cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has been bombarded because of the dismissals and has ultimately resigned his office.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In particular, the Inspector General's report critically addressed the role of Gonzales by bearing the "principal responsibility" for dismissals, "discontinuing" his leadership role and showing himself "extraordinarily disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including former Chief Advisor to President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for lack of cooperation with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored during the music award ceremony "Q Award" for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold prize in London next week during the award ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track for Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's award after being narrowed in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that went beyond such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 and has reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years on the charts and has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, one of which was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute larynx inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of major thoroughfares, avenues, sideways, and other bypasses, some of which are famous and others just convenient.
Nevertheless, it is difficult even for experienced taxi drivers and long-time locals to tell where Extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used thoroughfare.
There are no road signs either.
It is virtually impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to repaddle Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the block's past.
However, the City Administration Department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the street, has no interest in preserving them.
During a meeting of the community council's land use committee this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the construction company's purchase of the road.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district officials in municipal council 3.
"Very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, what could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it would repaddle the small street and set up seats designed, among other things, for a café to which the company would like to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the road, it did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decayed alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Building Protection Department, said it was actually the city's desire to sell the street, stressing that the department's task was to develop rather than manage the real estate.
Compared to his colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of his historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was split between its numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by any.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punk rock monument closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly most known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, sheets and ropes.
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splinter of the city, which should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the Dying City") has published part of the city's history talk about Extra Place, which had appeared in the journal "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end that remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, locked windows and weekly newspapers flying past rain troughs".
With a few exceptions, the road looked just like that recently on an evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti could be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bunch of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be slightly polished.
Fields, added that according to him, some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: Education in English-speaking environments
In this issue of the Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior research associate in Kalifonic Studies and senior director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection".
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the probability of Afro-American and Hispanic students successfully completing school is lower than that of white students" - which is true.
To close this gap, Obama's education plan specifically recommends, among others, a bilingual transition period in education for those who are learning English first.
Nevertheless, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Consider "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of fourth grade students passed the state examination in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year were rated as good in the English exam.
This amazing success was achieved with other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The school Sixth Street places its emphasis on review and exercise, on continuous control of knowledge and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach by which education takes place in an English-speaking environment. This is exactly the point that Obama is supposed to pay attention to, according to headmistress Linda Mikels.
This approach places great emphasis on the almost exclusive use of the English language in technical instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later, you would enter the classroom and not be able to recognize him.
"It works," she remarked, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English learning students?
The school's achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within its own party (national image associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about legislation aimed at "English only".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Obama actually wants to close the gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work instead of despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices fall as a result of renewed fears about the economy
The oil price fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the American bailout plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude oil forwards on the New York Stock Exchange fell 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
Over the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turmoil on Wall Street and strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 per barrel in July, prices dropped to nearly $90 per barrel this month, to rise again as a result of enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors showed concern again, although congressional representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan this weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the final chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, Citigroup is to buy up the banking business of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it has not been possible to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to decline further.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a statement to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates had become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US American virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The Bank's analysts have revised their oil consumption expectations downwards due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and reduced their oil and gas price forecasts for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set by series in second quarter
Interior defender Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything after he had appeared more often than anyone in the Jets jersey for the last eight and a half years.
Then on Sunday, he saw the second quarter where the Jets turned a fruitless game into a triumphal move.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
After a sloppy match between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect prelude to an afternoon when her evolving collaboration took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, one of which slipped out as an outside defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't make much effort," Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote voted no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles played catch, the defense quarterback took Kurt Warner apart.
External defender Darrelle Revis intercepted an accident and turned him into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and picked him up.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game as the Jets regained the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20-yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, coach of the Jets, replied "The Second Quarter or the Third Quarter?"
To the answers both, because the jets allowed 21 points to be achieved without a single one in the third quarter, Mangini said, "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Rested Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some consider him to be the best long-distance runner of all time, after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to make the distance of 42.2 kilometres in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least one world championship title or set a world record on every distance from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month Gebrselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, for fear, which may have been exaggerated in retrospect, that air pollution could aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at start and 13 degrees at finish - Gebrselassie has won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed to long-distance, the record time for marathons in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and therefore could not train for a week.
Apparently, he was refreshed after the break and did not come back rusty.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great."
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - for over-orchestrating his race runs, avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders, as if that were a track race, and setting world records over the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassie as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the route in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers dropped.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last start to separate from Kwambai, who arrived second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germans, has completed a considerable year by showing the seventh fastest result ever with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as a back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She has planned her run cleverly by letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners tear out first, but passed after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the strain in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the outgrowths of amusement parks in the vicinity of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic hustle and bustle, lies a quiet city where the pride and complications of Afro-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guaves, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that describes it – and that made it a tourist destination by including it in the Florida travel guide, which was produced by the Federal Writer's Project at the time of the depression – is, in many ways, a very special place.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified and private as in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential scandal, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion on racial relations, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth a resident of the city and parishioner of the oldest church in the city.
It must be true."
Eatonville was long defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on guard.
And so the concerns about Eatonville's image actually began with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Naughty as Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Beyond the street to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, although he can barely read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of all kinds and what-also-always suits hour rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about her beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came into town, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed in pants, in a city that even today is imagining its venerable dress style.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the residents were fascinated, while many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he rocked in his chair, on a rear-facing terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no great commemoration, no public readings in a grand style.
"I don't think they have understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the municipality's slow two-lane main street.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred to the community.
"During this time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the off-the-shelf people," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even once a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand to force integration by calling its decision in the Brown case against the school council "intimidating instead of respecting my race".
Residents today say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - hugging his teacher in the morning and hugging his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri , daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained until teachers and students stopped coming from the same place.
"You didn't hug his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, civil rights have helped to create space for more Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who were over prejudiced, just as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements like, "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker set out for Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much-praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshelves, and made them again a part of the American literary canon.
The highway project came exactly at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the public light.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-lane highway revived the city, accelerated the whole at top speed, awakened real citizen pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There were more and more visitors, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to re-appreciate the past.
Eatonville was included in the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-story library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on newly cobbled and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from downtown Orlando can it sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It's 90% black nowadays.)
Outsiders looking for Eatonville's history and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews a permit is necessary in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men in the field work - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a fondness for dark red, still fear that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew bigger, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed up like any other race and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or with the police, who according to him could use some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to correctly describe Eatonville.
"Most people who only pass through here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," Alondra Kenon said the other day on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at your story for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, they speak fluently.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and the huge television screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that above their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund administrators who have the monopoly in New York, have daily the worst horror day since the 1929 stock market crash.
Suppliers still push the metal tea carts along sidewalks with loud rattles and carry trays loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still slid around between apartments like human pack animals loaded with around 50 ironed t-shirts hanging on a yoke-like pole lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their breakfast bagels on the sidewalks and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4pm and 7pm.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon, due to all the doomsday talk, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to put my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase regular branch, about 20 people were already standing in line.
Not at the cash desks to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service counter where regular customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for the way to the department store Macy's and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them before me, so I learned later from Starr, my "personal bank employee with license", stood for the same reason as I queued.
Unlike me, however, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called Thrifts (a little similar to a construction savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state, saying they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silently and quietly bankrupt.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion assets, went into bankruptcy administration and when last Friday New Yorker drove home for the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns savings assets worth $440 billion, was looking for a saving buyer.
In fear of another collapse, the office and shopkeepers standing in front of me brought their bares to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank responsible for most of Wall Street's rescue purchases.
In recent weeks, normal New Yorkers have acquired a flowing financial column.
A woman who spoke on the phone in my Chinese stock market took with so much familiarity reference to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank and its emaciated-looking CEO Dick Fuld as if she were blaspheming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the about 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, got away from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I changed, I'm not going to risk any more."
Muslem graves desecrated during right slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing member of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, are taking part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008 to represent the organisation "Cities Against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed through with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of grave desecration in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend that extremely right-wing parties made significant gains in the country's parliamentary election.
During the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an action organized according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this an attempt to conceal the motive of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" by the news of the grave desecration that took place when the religious month of Muslim Ramadan comes to an end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is underway in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that received almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their ballots were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the vote, advocated a ban on headscarves and burkas and even expressed his aversion to food, which is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which indicate that the extreme right is the politically strongest bloc in the country, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
Richter imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent were granted last Thursday to impose a foreign travel ban after providing the judges with evidence of Glitter's criminal record of sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
Speaker of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, September 25, the Kent police requested permission from the Ashford District Court to prevent Mr. Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until March 25th.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the register for sex offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a five-year prison term.
The Kent police said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokesperson for Kent's police unit said, "Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It's top concern of the Kent police to protect Kent's residents and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he was uncomfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew to Hong Kong after some time.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Last but not least, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to request that he register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
'I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who renounce concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into these moments that are strange to the audience, I know when I can find a gesture typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen look or expressiveness of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his project 'Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer portrays alternate theatricalism of some productions on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side, he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the programme of the Month of Flamenco's Photography, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is increasing from day to day,' the artist explains and makes it clear that 'Flamenco-people' can be any human being, but when you look at the photos, the viewer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Their personality and character is in their hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the photo camera.'
In 1997, Bauer, inspired by the festival 'Cante de las Minas', set out on a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that remind of classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, which gives the image modernity and the idea, as the Bauer Flamenco understands: 'Music with traditional roots, which changes and surprises every day'.
These are not just the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, being, is and was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fotómata in the near future.
Famous personalities in Flamenco including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the narrow selection of almost seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and realize it as a 'portrait of the veterans of sports' ('SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives me great pleasure in photographing people, getting to know them and putting me in their state of life, be it for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or meet people, personalities you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a couple of minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of today's Flamenco portraits entitled 'Flamenco-people' is on display in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street of la Alameda de Hercules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the Roma he's writing is 'a foolhardy'.
He does not yet know where the plot of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project he is working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon area.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project with which he is engaged is 'a foolhardy' and 'everything indicates that he does not have to write the novel'.
'If I were prudent, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel at some point,' so he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he has seen hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won Premium of the Hay Festival and gave most of the audience her voice, is compared to the old edition of 'Our mutual friend' and can be seen at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noted that he had an audience in front of him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who had a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature arose, which from 'extraordinary adventure', from 'joy at reading' and 'experiencing more than before' emerges; how he writes and 'discipline' to supplement 'the lack of inspiration', his intense work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his calling and what 'memory images' are the basis for his stories.
The Hispanic-American novel writer acknowledged that there is 'no way' to measure what one can measure and how one can know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience,' stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it 'creates effects' and 'brings people even more apart', so I asked the writers 'not to leave themselves to ease' and 'take responsibility' for his calling.
The weather did not play along at the Pozoblanco festival: bullfighting parties were partly cancelled.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the square was in bad condition, the bullfighting festival with which the festival in Pozoblanco was to be completed was moved to yesterday morning.
The organizer, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the festival was exposed to the volatile weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, so the second planned bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and one ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, much of the audience reacted in his second fight with Buh-Rufen.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes to ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the city of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers called on the drivers of the car to stop, and then they took the run.
It looked like they wouldn't have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police chased her and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old known as A. A. J., as reported by the Interior Ministry of the Basque State.
The person arrested was accused of drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police of the Álava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased speed and tried to escape control.
The police started the persecution until the car stopped at the edge after a few kilometers. At that moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee via a country road to a forest area.
The police of Ertzaintza City finally caught up with one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug traffickers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to precise laboratory analysis and weighing the bundles to other police stations.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate was 'double', so that it did not match the license plate indicated in the car papers, which is why an additional arrest was carried out for forgery of official documents.
The police of Ertzaintza City continue the investigation to investigate the arrest of the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A. A. J. was taken to a police station for interrogation. He will be brought before the prison judge in the next hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown medication.
The actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda in the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the effect of an unknown medication.
A witness observed how she tried to get out of her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, California traffic police spokesman reported to the magazine `People'.
The witness told in detail that Locklear pushed through 'after 4:30 p.m. gas pedal and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and as she was driving backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.'
A little later, the witness, who at first had probably not recognized the actress, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby road and exiting the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she 'feared of Locklears'.
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the street and thereby blocked traffic.
'She seemed disoriented,' so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol centre to take a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was ruled out from the first moment. `As a result of the officials' first observations, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,' the speaker said.
Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving under the influence of an undetermined substance that could not be determined, and was taken to a local detention centre around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic after treatment, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Union of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and MP of the United Left, today assured that the Regional Association of Education will be the one who will make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sports of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one to take responsibility for it', Llamazares pointed out the approach the party must take towards the one who has so far served as a city councillor in the Seville municipal council.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the necessity of 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the rule violations that Silva might have begun: 'The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education 'has a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
`Sangre de mayo': Hero Book by Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' presents the revised version of the famous Spanish insurrection against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros of investment for filming.
In this way, the Cineast has attempted to 'present a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci today explained at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of actors.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, is presented this Friday in cinemas and later shown on the telemadrid station as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós' literature, assures us that thanks to this film his 'childhood dream' came true. He owes this to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the autonomous community of Madrid to make a memorial film for the second century celebration in Madrid on 2 November. Above all, because the story is based on 'Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the commission.
The total contribution of 15 million made for filming by the autonomous community of Madrid offers, as he added, the 'one-time possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the image of 'confused Spain, which chose the false leader for the fight because the people had been left behind by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII'.
However, the Cineast regrets that the financing could not be expected as with `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as with `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be shot.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in 'Volver a empezar', has participated through his usual way of working: he stood on stage with the actors with whom one first has to rehearse before one starts to shoot and for those who had not done casting he appeared 'demeaning' and respectful, 'a part of the profession of film director consists of providing help in theater and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which one works.'
Many actors he encounters in 'Sangre de mayo' must repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he has won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo', nor `Siete mesas de billar francés' and, finally, not the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
For this film, Garci does not expect any awards.
'In the beginning you think you're working for the progeny, later you realize that it's only for flourishing, and now you're happy when you've still produced a movie,' says Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville adores a dancer who is also from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalucian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and advocated the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
Isabel Bayón was fascinated by the life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the period between the wars.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
'We're not trying to tell about her life, but to preserve her esprit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
'The Dance of the Butterfly' seemed to me like Guajira, for example, or 'The Dance of the Snake' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing was also in this aesthetic area,' she claims.
The production anticipates two extraordinary collaborations: Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in 'La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I am very honored.'
The production also anticipates musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he 'takes over the role of companion of the artists who were divas, to whom he falls in love again and again.'
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
'I wanted to call her back in memory, because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a certain epoch and whose works no one knows anymore and therefore appreciates her even less,' Bayón claims.
The performance takes place today at 20:30 at the Theatre Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916 Zenobia, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the `Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of the two.
Thus `the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress, which takes place in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the travelling exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, now reached New York and is presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado', edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make known the person and work of the Andalusian world poet.
The U.S. can't imagine itself badly without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him in 'sensation reporter', and from the then prevailing performance of American cinema, which was abandoned, from all America to Newman with his inspiring performance and followed her.
Look what it cost to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Still, that was a big blow to everyone.
'What a person sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,' said Robert Redford crying, 'my life and my country were the greatest troubles of his life.'
No one was afraid of being ridiculed or exaggerated.
As the 'father' of the cinema and the country, he died in a sad moment in which there is fear of terrorists and of the market collapse, in which the depressed self-esteem of the Americans in the hopeless search for reasons for regaining dignity is.
If there are few people left who can be admired in this hard time without virtue, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as well as various losses both profits: from the foundation, which has dedicated itself to the fight against drugs and was founded in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, to the own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift for the country, where it took him a lot of effort to fight against a deadly diet.
A wide wave of amazement strikes home high above Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died, but the whole era.
Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
'The greatest of us all has left us,' confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who dare to live today trying to live as Paul Newman lived: to maintain high demands on righteousness, to lead a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example.
He divorced once and was then married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, to whom he was faithful, although there were certainly many ways not to be.
'Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?' he often joked himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, he was as proud of none as he was of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandpa and the philanthropist,' they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are inadequate.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, maybe it could be 2016.
But I wonder: 'Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not true!
She was described as a perfect road, and in my opinion, she was the worst road with everything on it and on it.
Of course, that's a lot of nonsense, if you would pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it out, that would clearly not have come through.
But let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticketing that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they let you go, they should give you everything (including chip to avoid traffic jams on the road).
Not at all.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of just going there) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt only existed in the size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it so that after the crisis was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
All right, things like this are a little thing compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
The waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as was to be expected, the road began and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had once succeeded, but it would be more difficult to get them back.
In addition, it looked like in these 40 minutes of waiting time for rain, so there was a temptation to organize a popular uprising and raid the cottage.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time for classification because of this chip I got, I can already imagine that the exit was mislabelled.
Of course, if they asked me about a perfect road, I would never think of that road.
So I think we'll long dream of a city well prepared for the Olympic Games
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which, however, is capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move on the company's campus).The system pays attention to what it hears during entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this 'receptionist' can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also classify those present after the discussions in the groups.
In the presentation video, 'the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group that is talking to her, and that he is not a company employee either.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will be listening soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of their Windows operating system.
This week they talked very superficially about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have as many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft added one or the other feature and 'extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worth it
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, that was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Skillfully, many pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to function simultaneously.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system every time, but more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the surroundings of the 'windows'.
What does half of the applications in the computer serve?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, without a doubt. I bring a small example of it.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the soft drink machine: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use its own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of Microsoft employees used Google for web searches.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to get Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 on the mark at the same time.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso did it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we start to list the countless stars performances, we can go back to the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard, who had lifted heavy weights in a travelling circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and tailored.
The English-speaking people call it 'tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, surpasses all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called 'Marcel' in the narrow circle. Legend tells that the name creation is associated with sport and comes from boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' excels all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (presumably recognisable) that these T-shirts have as detail on the neckline.
And be careful, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of 'tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton pants, T-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's a shame to use them as undergarments.
You're very charming.
'I want to be a young mother; I'm not worried about the candidate'
Her great standing with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is delicate, but full of joie de vivre.
At the moment, Gruz siblings take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who maintain their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved her residence there and also made the presentation of the most important premiums in fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner in Valentino's honor.
A very intense working time that is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to go through a city and watch women dress, how they combine their clothes, I often do that.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but finally, everything meets in one and these areas have many similarities.
Since I was little, I was thrilled with the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to rummage around in my aunt's clothes lockers and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a amusement park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to look after the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in class and rehearsals to look into the mirror and feel good.
As an actress, if you get the costume, you put yourself in the real acting role.
Finally, everything is connected to each other, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
Recently you turned 30, didn't you fall into a crisis?
Oh, don't worry.
I feel better than ever, as a thirty-year-old I feel good.
I think the woman gets mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've done the things I've wanted to do since I was little, and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
For a long time I have known that I am going to be a mother because that is what my body demands and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
I will give my child great happiness and raise it with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works you took part in and were filmed last year.
That's exactly the way it is and I want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which, of course, cannot be immediate.
I very much hope that 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A few days ago, you showed up on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
All right, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, simply called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show. I know that two garments from our collection for Mango were auctioned off to raise the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
I, as the one she knows, would tell you they're not true.
Nevertheless, I will support this good cause in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this generous cause, but when she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
The drivers, who can fall back because of the alcohol level, will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver who had three official penalties for the alcohol level installs in his car this system, which forbids him to start the car in a drunken state. If he is alcoholized, the car does not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General. According to her, it is a pilot project, which will take a year.
The purpose is to re-socialize the driver, which is why he gets a course for re-education of traffic behaviour.
In addition to the Attorney General's Office, according to experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of motorists, who were reported more than once because of driving under alcohol influence, returned to the wheel.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system associated with the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents autostart when the driver has taken alcohol test; or when an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than EUR 1 000, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of the rule violations as early as the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, 115 lives are expected to be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behavior before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is called for, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still available in the Spanish markets, in no store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow of all days, the House of Deputies will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., at the time provided by the program, next to the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez de México Airport DF landed the plane of the Spanish Air Force, with which Prince and Princess of Asturias traveled.
The sun went down, but its rays still forced the hand to be used as a parasol to see the royal couple who got out of the plane.
Right on the gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so you can't take people at the airport at this time of the day. You're from here or something.
No, she's the Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, that's very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Princess of Asturias is and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the hangar of the airport and at the red carpet, also military protection of 27 Marine soldiers who surrender salve of honor.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in marine blue, and she, the princess, with long hair blown by the wind, without ordinary `peep-toes', perhaps she was told that it is expected a thunderstorm in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official entourage waits.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for her, who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly outstanding fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Ads' to promote and increase young fashion talents internationally.
This will be awarded a cash prize of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings in the Mango store window on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris yesterday and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest store is located in London.
So many events have happened that are connected to the fact that one would like to thank fashion designer Valentino for his jury chairmanship at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart broken by the pain, because his brother recently died, pulls himself together. He pulls the suit from the fashion house and wears some of ELAH’s jewelry that were breathtaking. He held to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango House, greeted the guests and was such a cavalry, so he ended up with the Baron of Rotschild without jackets, because jackets they lent to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, hurryed to the store and had a pair of trousers and a shirt on which she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet rehearsals, so she got in excitement, remembered the old times, grabbed a pole and made a kind of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre did not join the walk through the palace's premises, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on her cell phone.
The next morning we could look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and Jon Travolta, who, upon his arrival (with his own bed coats and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Advice against stress
There is not 1000, but one more way to forget chaotic everyday life.
And even though there are few, they are all collected in a book that says how to relax, and the book comes to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse is the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of how to turn off the world of work.
The number increases, however, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the whole list of possibilities that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called '1001 ways to relax' and so the calm that the book conveys comes to the bookshops of the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who believes that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered how to stay in touch with nature or the 100% natural recipes suggested that lead to relaxation.
When the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some Children Speak at Night
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us what happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be frightened, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called talking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Certainly, more than one of you were told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (one time in life, for example, during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child cannot remember anything.
There is no single reason to cause this appearance.
Relationships with other phenomena in sleep are often sought, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, enuresis noctura (bed wetting at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we have mentioned before, it may be due to very high fiber, stress situations or overload.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency at which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one speaks calmly in individual words, whispers or it can be quite the opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the statement is very intense, it is recommended that the child be observed and advised by a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and thus results.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, be it, it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to excite the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are terrible and a little too wild.
For the nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep calmly.
If speaking occurs in sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it's harmless to the child, and the next day it won't remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, for the child is unconscious, so you will tear him out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it turns out to be frightened after a pair of appearances, it is recommended to seek advice or to find out what the child is afraid of.
When they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to conduct an interrogation and get out more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says so, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, it doesn't tell the kid that you hear this at night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
It's causing a lot of anxiety.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhouses ... finally
After a long period of thirst, Illhäuser on the field is finally back on track for success.
Without much effort, the yellow-blacks gained numerous goal chances and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers had trouble showing their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose long shot just passed the angle, Illhäuser was to dominate the game with ease, and it succeeded alternately first Funderflick with a long shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot tip, to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and only allowed the lively Riahi to pass at the head of the storm.
The start of the second half was to be decisive with initially two goal chances won by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the Illhäuser through Marais, which stood just right to accept a ball that had been repelled in a first attempt by Diebold.
However, the Ilhäusian goal scorer should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bench about twelve minutes later, making his teammates inferior in number to continue playing.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and did not face any great problems to an ill-haeusian elf, who only retreated a little to 'condense' their defenses, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
In view of the firm attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to arrive Tuesday morning at the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit', and hope that he will come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee set up by the Breton fishermen to enforce measures in the face of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record average of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the press officer of the Elysée Palace David Martinon, 'the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again, and to secure the conditions of employment and the payment of seafarers'.
Sarkozy is eagerly awaited by the fishermen.
Tuesday morning, they led protests in Morbihan and Calvado's marches, which caused traffic jams of almost ten kilometres.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break off.
The Quiberon Peninsula was demarcated with a barrier.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets from the early morning before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
In the evening, the fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the important total refinery in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting at the Ministry before deciding on possible measures.
Indeed, the Crisis Committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Committee who did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not give in at any point' and 'don't want to go to Paris', announced Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee, for example.
The professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently cost the litre about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from 'Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 due to the consequences of cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and also Sam Mendes said good-bye to the cinema legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the impending recession, as a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, holds its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirming its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes for much of the Chinese market, especially for its 30 to 120-seat aircraft.
To date, Embraer has supplied 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider surrendering more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the American Monetary Authority, is considering handing over more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion advanced to it.
AIG is willing to drive the sale of much of its business, beyond its international life insurance and pension provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of AIG met Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained with the AIG.
The assets from which AIG would potentially separate include its aircraft leasing branch International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, FT further explains.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly make the sales to repay the loans over 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve, also at the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be equally lost.
Analysis Historical Paris of the session Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic case of prices on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has dropped 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
As far as points are concerned, the strongest case in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final firing figures, the Nasdag index, mainly related to technique, has dropped by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widespread Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection by the Chamber of Deputies of the plan to rescue the banks, which was intended to restore some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
By 228 votes against and 205 against, the MPs denied the financial secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
'A bad picture is being circulated here, which makes Congress unable to accept a plan,' said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market counted on this plan,' she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days will be 'too late'.
'If the project is indeed doomed to failure (...), it will quickly be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, note d. Red.) and other central banks to get a grip on the crisis, which would limit credit conditions even more,' warned Brian Bethune, head of the economy at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed, stressing the feeling of extreme urgency even more, 'that every day that passes brings the ruin of a financial company' in the United States'.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to buy up the banking operations of Wachovia by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are facing 'not just an American but a global crisis', added the analyst of the FTN Financial.
The market for basic consumer goods has grown strongly.
Revenues of the State Treasury within ten years have decreased Friday evening from 3.632% to 3.827%, and revenues within 30 years yesterday evening from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner after points in the first TV duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another one to find out who emerged from it as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television duel for the election of both Republicans and Democrats, which was to be pursued by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite similar, was not 'brilliant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday, according to Obama with five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat clearly makes the better figure.
With the still undecided voters, i.e. those who matter now, Obama emerged as the winner of the polls at 39%, while according to a CBS poll 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin,
'It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts', but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-seven-year-old McCain did not stop putting his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy to the fore, clearly underlining his opponent's 'naïveness' on these issues, which were the focus of this first television duel.
'Senator Obama does not seem to understand that...' he stressed several times.
'I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to become president,' he also assured.
An attack point that has been preached in the Republican electoral commercials since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He spoke briefly and precisely, without getting lost in his head.
He put his ability to make good decisions and renew the image that the world has of the United States.
'McCain has still not understood, but Obama has,' this weekend, opposed a democratic election commercial in which Republicans were accused of not having grasped the full extent of the crisis that is taking place on the 'American off the street'.
'During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you,' Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in pouring rain at an election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'middle class' or 'worker'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, whom the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy even on the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
'The coming week could be a crucial turning point,' estimated the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration member, compared Obama's 'good economic instincts' to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is 'the final verdict of an eight-year poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After stressing once again that he might even manage to lower taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois Senator pointed out that the creation of a country's potential energy independence and the promotion of renewable energies, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, were his top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant from 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully avoided the issues raised by the plan to save the financial market of over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
'Have you noticed that an election took place in Minsk?'
Young people and oppositionists demonstrated Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the general election in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closure of the polling stations in Minsk's market square to protest the fraudulent nature of the general election.
Although no result had yet been announced, numerous youths had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they didn't even vote at all: 'What good is that if they do what they want with my voice anyway,' says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is prepared to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-issue of visas for 40 leading Belarusian figures and the imposition of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
'We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the count,' regretted Juri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous union of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us that is the executive.
If members of the opposition move into parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, gets into a crisis and we don't reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent'.
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, does not recognise the election as valid.
She stressed that turnout figures were too high and that the extension of voting in advance (26% of Minsk voters) paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that an election took place?, asks the leader of the social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, those most likely to be in line with the Government's ideas.'
The silence of the night descends again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Conversation - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be happy because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
Above all, it has regained public confidence, which had been seriously shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
It is known that during the 1980s national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross blood donation service were contaminated with the HIV virus and hepatitis C virus.
In the face of this drama and public discontent, in February 1994 the Government of Canada launched a public inquiry led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and to develop guidelines to prevent another catastrophe of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to submit his report, several provinces then set up a committee whose aim was to develop a new system for managing blood cans in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
`In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started her work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and through the work in this field during the following years, we have regained public confidence', she says, before proudly stressing that in early 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its foundation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting on the principle of caution.
At this time we witnessed the emergence of numerous cases of human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, told this woman, who has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
'And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we relied on one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which exclusion measures are applied if one does not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease was transmitted through the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied has quite a sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which allow the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in the donor's blood, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation time that takes place between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than one week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors might be infected without knowing it, and one could not see this, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is in danger of getting HIV - infected blood.
'In other words, it means that you have to distribute 12 million canned blood before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cans each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs where HIV was transmitted via a blood can.
I think you can feel comfortable with it these days when you get or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore health," says the director of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Only last year has the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, just like the Westnil virus, is transmitted through the blood by insects.
We need to monitor continuously,' continues Dr. Décary, before stressing that Hema-Quebec must provide adequate care in addition to a safe supply.
'The need is increasing because the population is aging.
As anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which on average accounts for only 3% of Quebec's residents suitable for blood donation.
Every healthy person, who is 18 years of age or older and meets the eligibility criteria, can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because, for example, they are ill with AIDS or malaria, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from blood donation for one year.
`With these 3%, we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of the hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It's hard to convince people to donate blood, but especially to keep them and get them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find the time to spend an hour giving blood,' regrets Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood preserves, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively in case of severe fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed, and frozen before being intermediated at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec's only public umbilical cord blood bank.
The umbilical cord, formerly considered biomedical waste, contains blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to reduce more than a thousand annually.
'We should probably start making it available for transplants at the beginning of next year,' explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of umbilical cord blood removal as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced that they do not have access to it', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all of Quebec's hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in semi-finals
Montreal's Impact yesterday qualified for the semi-final round of the USL's first league elimination matches thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders in the second and deciding game of the quarter final series in the Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal ratio counted.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the ninetieth minute of the match.
After a first half without goal for both the one and the other side, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the Montreal Formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let's remember that at the first game of the pre-return series on Friday Impact had brought a 2 to 1 defeat to the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle.
Impact will compete with the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night, Thunder was able to compensate a 3 to 1 deficit by a 4 to 3 win in the Minnesota rematch, but the Whitecaps nevertheless moved into the semi-final round with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - Victory Gate by Kovalev
The Canadian team's number one trio is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Florida Panthers with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass in this winning game, the fourth of the Tricolore into six preparatory games.
Kovalev scored the win by shooting the only goal of the whole shootout.
'I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.
`He was too attached to it in the first half, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause.'
Charest relies on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out the opening of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left) attempted to be elected in today's partial election.
'Moving the course of our last big border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Quebec Liberal Party in Levis, entirely following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric power plants, mines, viewed from Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc.
Great means as during the parliamentary term.
Moreover, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would hold the elections this autumn, even if he said that his calendar was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area' which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned recently in the Prime Minister's speeches, the opening of the North - the northern area at the 49th parallel - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, confined himself to explaining why the North was 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not mention a date, no investment sums, or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At the most, some prospects for what could be worked on more: above all, water, forest, but especially mining, benefiting from the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Charest, the north has 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This 'area twice as large as France' is near us, is in Quebec.
It's not just in our vicinity, it's in us', he stressed, how to show clearly that he is trying to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown greatly by its connection with the north, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
'It's ours, it's our future,' he added, having taken a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the Prime Minister told the press.
'This is a traditional attitude that all governments followed.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, when the opportunity arises, I will take up this position again on behalf of the government,' he said.
In addition, 'with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North', he explained and talked about the Northwest Passage, which will be passable all year round due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would handle them very carefully, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekist MP of Ungava) have already begun discussions in some thirty communities.
A committee of ministers led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) occupies an important place, has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity at which 'one will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
Plan North will be 'spouse, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as being a continuation of those liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have changed our mind to turn the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
By the way, this was one of the repeatedly raised themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's takeover of the party leadership.
One of the adopted decisions provides for the renaming of the Beauharnois power plant to Adélard-Godbout dam.
'From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, through Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,' explained Jean Charest.
To the press he referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the 'Roads to the North' program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
As regards the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr Charest stressed that it was planned to be put into operation in 2012.
'This remains between us, but I intend to be there,' he confided to his party members, which resulted in those incident storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has indeed not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible for him from the law.
However, he stressed that his calendar was full, mainly because of a Community Council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The weekend General Assembly provided the Liberal party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially 'constitutional objectives' that were readily adopted: the PLQ particularly calls for recognition of the 'specificity of Quebec' in the Constitution.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications, and that they have a veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition has taken on board the guidelines of Plan Nord with scepticism.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has re-launched the policy for the development of the Nord-du-Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to it, when it came to power in 2003, the liberal government refused to apply it.
If she had done so, 'we would have gone much further today', Mrs Marois judged at the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has called for the government to support the adoption of a plan north.
'But what we want is that this is not just a big idea,' declared party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who is returning from his vacation today.
Letters - A dishonoured country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justice' minister (welch irony) in the Harper Cabinet was it who allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour last summer that she was a 'damage' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged an unending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration, so to cover with reproach, says just as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government which, as the only one from all the countries concerned, did not bring home its fellow countryman trapped in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when things happened to him.
The only government that breaks its word despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention and has a child soldier vegetated under inhuman conditions.
The only one who descends to a judicial parody to appraise the accused's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers' Association in particular are pleading to bring Omar Khadr home to get him a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that is also closing its eyes to torture: it is of little interest to them that, after so many years of torture, a young adult will certainly be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing here an insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly carries like a flag before him, and that sounds so meaningless from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: one can arbitrarily abuse, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, according to the opinion of a head of government who is still supported only by the minority (may he belong entirely to the minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what made our country's reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this renunciation, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-Director-General of the Barrick Gold Mine in Canada.
This confirms, and follows an Orwellian logic, that the world's largest gold mining company sought a libel lawsuit over six million against three authors and a small penniless publishing house, with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of libel lawsuits, but about the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the trial proceeds, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defenses and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactics in these unequal struggles are, moreover, often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensual settlement that silences the other side and also deters anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things to public opinion.
In contrast to what is common in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates are usually held in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not through billets.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened a real debate through which newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent inspection teams could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes aside the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand move.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate, disregarding the opinions of this very public?
Apparently, this word in the vice-president's world includes only generous paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public, who supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada, does so mainly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a gag suit (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just addressed a demand to the authors of Noir Canada in which they require them to stop using this term...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's lawsuit is a direct attack on freedom for academic research and truth-finding, which are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss topics that the rich companies of this world do not like, then who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment to which we belong has long known how to deal with debates and disagreements and how to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, unlike what she pretends, she does not want a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit this kind of unjustified lawsuits.
Wall Street bailout - Democrats and Republicans get along
The Bush administration and senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan over $700 billion, which is intended to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months, still needs to be adopted by the two congressional chambers.
The main features are: better control by MEPs of the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of public funds used, new injunctions to curb the number of houses pledged due to arrears, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the executives of the companies supported.
The American finance secretary Henry Paulson, the president of the Nancy Pelosi Chamber of Deputies, and the Republican representative present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the market,' said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
'Everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis on Wall Street,' explained the Democrat.
'This is the basic point: if we don't, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of Americans will be enormous,' explained Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, for fear of the effect that a renewed failure would have had on the mood of investors.
The deadline that had been agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who took part in the negotiations only late, were more likely to be supporters of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that they had to be met in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain warrants for agreement, especially those intended to allow owners to keep their homes, and those relating to the salaries of executives of companies saved from the state.
'If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain people, that is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary,' he said on American television stations.
When asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied, 'I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The guidelines I have read [show] that this is one thing that we all will have to digest, and with which we will be able to progress.
The option of doing nothing is simply unacceptable,' he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is designed to use taxpayers' money
It comes 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble, which initially led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprime) before it expanded to further forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and eventually resulted in a freeze of financial strength and ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican MPs who made the first attempt to reach agreement last week fail.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'poisonous' assets of societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not be bought, it is believed to escape the impasse.
To round off the perspective for everyone in Congress, an injunction has also been added that if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, it could then levy new taxes in order to get back its invested capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial sum of 250 billion, to which a further 100 billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his assistance, Washington receives shares in the assisted companies that pay him dividends in the event of profits, and which it can sell again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the option of stopping the seizure procedures relating to the dwellings linked to the real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as setting deadlines for the repayment and severance payments paid to the executives of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on him already today, and the Senate then on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, there were further votes against this proposal yesterday, both from the Republicans and the Democrats.
'It is obvious that Washington does not understand us,' declared Republican Scott Garett, member of the Chamber of Finance Commission, to his constituents.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists of asking taxpayers to pay.'
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called 'the Caucus of Skeptics', presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us to tell us: we ask Congress not to be pressured, and to consider carefully what course to take,' he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe were once again shown that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
Intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, who has been in great difficulty since losing EUR 2 billion (US$ 2.9 billion) in the crisis due to risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not lost money, declared yesterday the Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos.
To compensate, we receive a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households value now that uncertain times are about to come.'
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was in the process of nationalizing another bank in distress by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) are real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the UK bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be, after Northern Rock, the second bank the British government has had to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was his trump for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor with the charming smile free himself from the narcissistic mirror?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensitivity, and obvious talent have probably also kept him away from a position of power that gives birth to the truly terrible monsters.
But what a big runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 on the consequences of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more carefully in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but just as much an apostle of freedom and the blasting of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often results in wonderful children.
He was born in 1925 in Ohio to a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots one of the glorious faces of the American dream should emerge.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality characteristic.
Because it reflected a whole country that was in love with the self-made man, the fighter who was injured in combat in the Pacific War, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s, and then visited Actor's Studio in New York before he succeeded at the theater, on television, and soon also in the cinema.
This same man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who finished second in the 1979 24-hour race of Man's, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a show-off relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it, the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed star, oversensitive to the glamour of the show business, whose riddles will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman put the movie lovers in Taumel this weekend, while all his great roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change is passing by with him.
Once again, the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes to mind, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) into The Cat on the hot tin roof filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
It evokes a much shorter past memory (1990) that of his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is disturbed at his old age by a wedding that did not fulfill all her promises.
So many other Paul Newmans existed throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A Hand Full of Dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, was re-recorded after his death and made the Newman well-known in 1956.
This sympathetic groove in the outstanding The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through time, that was it.
Still him.
His résumé unites epochs.
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little Orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role in 2003 as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several movie legends who have withdrawn from the film world early enough, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his pomp and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humour, as a living challenge to 'underplaying' when he judged his overly expressive achievements.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flew for a long time only.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholics, cowards or desperate people, with whose perfect representation he reflected his slipping and his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead, drew a subtle female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott by overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
At the flood of honours that poured out on Newman yesterday, his close friend and former gun mate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared extremely poignantly: 'His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generousness and joie de vivre were the main characteristics of the late actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of drifting Hollywood, is now disappearing.
We have seen him standing often with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other food, and this considered quite tasteless, although we found it funny at first.
Nevertheless, the profits from his sales went to his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman engaged himself to the point of shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: 'Always and to the very end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.'
And it was an honor for us to be allowed to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Hammerg &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the trial of Jáno's contract and his accomplices will begin.
In particular, the accused are accused of involvement in organised crime, grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts, including document falsification.
According to the prosecutor's office, the funds generated from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often accompanied by counterfeit invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are said to have been partly paid into the funds of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the private funds of individual companies.
As the investigating authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender funds were collected and the clubs were not supposed to have fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were faked.
The invoice blocks were bought at the market of Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was decided on that tour north of Lake Balaton, to which István Lados of Jáno's contract was sent.
In the course of this "exploratory tour" Lado was to find pensions and restaurants.
He demanded bills on consumptions so that he could later issue bills based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest.
These bills are said to have been largely manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András ḥri, the latter being responsible for the constitution of the reports according to our information.
One of the destinations of Lados' "exploratory tour" was a beer restaurant.
According to two invoices issued by Hammer and Co in 2003, the catering company is said to have hosted the ninety-strong group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the head of the company says that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant at once.
Another bill issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious form and content errors.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed according to the bill.
The imagination of the falsifiers was obviously no longer limited when it came to the Pigal Kft., a catering company, in whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even appear, according to the prosecution.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas told hvg.hu, he immediately realized that these were fake documents when documents were submitted to him by the prosecutor during an interrogation.
"Our company name and tax number were misplaced on the stamp".
And further: Apart from formal errors, the fact that the company is said to have housed one hundred people was also wrong, after having a total of eleven rooms, which are impossible to accommodate so many people.
The restaurant had also been listed on the bill as catering, but the restaurant had not been operating for a long time.
The emphatic falsifiers have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they are targeting offers only travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary travels on the cash payment account, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
As was known in the course of the investigation, they also cited VAT on invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are exempt from VAT.
The total amount of VAT was wrong on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, as the company offsets only 15 percent VAT instead of 25. Moreover, the employees only issue machine invoices, but the forged documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made by the "invoicers" was that in one case they had indicated "goods transport" as a service rendered, although this is not offered by the company specializing in investment advice, the prosecutor's office informed.
Further formal errors - wrong invoice format, wrong stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as forgeries.
Also in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing directors affirmed never to have issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" has been made by the counterfeiters at the Hib Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This company was in disarray at the time (2001), when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore stated that they had not issued the invoices themselves.
Consciously Fake
The other group of accountants are individuals who were well aware that they would have to lay fictitious invoices.
At the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány has issued invoices for the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, persuaded Collab Kft.'s managing director to issue the fictitious bills.
The Biogate Kft., which is currently also in liquidation, is also said to have worked together with a supplement and co. In 2003, the GmbH is said to have provided the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület associations with counterfeit invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million relating to services not provided.
However, there were no payment transactions either, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after they were issued, which the parties concerned forgot to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based, but untraceable fuel and vehicle trading company.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components in the total value of HUF about 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, the Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is expected to have acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be sent by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has confessed during the investigation to have issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the clubs Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their countervalue itself.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian bricklayers on Iván Kubatov's explicit wish.
However, in reality none of these companies were active, which according to the defendant was due to lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov is expected to have issued 15 invoices worth HUF 14.2 million on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The prosecutor's office assumes that Kubatov may have collected 10% of the invoice amount and VAT each.
Kubatov is said to have even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were settled to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but have used these amounts for other purposes.
To cover this up, they have submitted five fictitious bills to the TMA of the Works Team Kft.
By the way, these invoices were made during the search of the Árpád Kemecsei office in the Ministry of Education.
In the course of the negotiations, some defendants are now expected to confess the procedure of counterfeiting, as it has already been filed before the prosecutor's office.
A sensation could be if the main defendant Jáno's supplement decides to make a comprehensive confession.
His information so far was less detailed, and although he had promised several times to report comprehensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the socialists have concluded a pact with him on reparation for the bulk of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether supplement in return is willing to assume responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that supplement will now play the "insulted" after his requests for relief of the detention and house arrest had been met on deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have done far greater harm with economic crimes and have not paid for them, are at large, or at least under house arrest, supplement this possibility is denied.
The Psychology of Exceeding - or Why We Are Ready to Pay More
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the bid.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even inflated prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was to play lottery while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were examined by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, was measured at auction losers, in which the opponent's overtaking plays an important role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-remuneration" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by the avoidance of an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, economists in the research group also conducted investigations to trace the money.
In this case, three groups should compete against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group were also promised $15 reward in case they emerge as winners from the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was therefore only that the emphasis was on winning, while the other was on losing.
However, as proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the "against losing" group were ready for higher stakes than those in the control group or the "win" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
In fact, the behaviour observed at auctions has so far only been motivated by the joy of winning or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to imaging neurological procedures, so we now have a third explanation ready" - said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Department of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should the doctor be consulted?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death in Hungary.
The number of people infected in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver disease caused by various viruses.
Symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from one another.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. by contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (e.g. semen, vaginal secretion or saliva).
In any case, travellers are recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B, and there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A are approximately two-three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, jaundice appears on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes light, the urine dark, and recovery can take up to two-three weeks.
Around 1 million people worldwide die every year from the far more severe diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten people infected is in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most people who are infected do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen destroys the liver cells insidiously - in many cases the first symptoms show up after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular checks, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease occurs more frequently: those who underwent blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable during a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the family doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognised in good time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby eliminating the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30th is the World Day of Hepatitis, 2004 for the first time organized by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to increase awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their development and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
According to recent research, religious belief is a kind of "mean of pain" that is said to have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It was examined to what extent belief in God influences the feeling of pain of man, reports the British paper "Telegraph".
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
The results showed that the faithful were able to eliminate most of the pain.
By means of a brain scan technology, it could even be proven that Catholics could activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participate.
During the experiment, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand, which gave off the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand a painting of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermeline".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would create a kind of religious trance, while they chose da Vinci's image because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt as reassuring.
The subjects each spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they were supposed to view either the religious, or the other painting.
Catholics reported that at the sight of the Mother of God they felt "in safety" as if they were "concerned" and they felt "peace and quiet".
While viewing the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in mind.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the experiment, said that you could also create similar effects with other, strong-acting images with the atheists, you just had to find the corresponding photo.
"We need to find a picture that triggers very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," the psychologist says.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practising the faith should change our personality, and it does so in many cases," says Wright.
After these excellent results, only the question remains, what effect a Madonna painting of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On the occasion of their tenth birthday, Google can claim that it can be found in people's pockets just as it can be found above their heads in the sky: it knows where people have spent their holidays, which specialists they go to, and what moves them.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
Towards sceptics plagued by Orwell's horror visions, he says: These would just overlook the essentials of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times recently, Schmidt said that Google's main objective was to collect even more personal data about users and thus to get closer to the company's original objective, according to which it wanted to "order all information in this world."
Schmidt stated that Google is still only at the beginning of collecting information after ten years of world-changing work.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished Google would be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "Which job really suits me?", but software programs are not yet able to do so, as they do not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows visitors to save their own search history and later use it so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and the so-called "recommendations" are also based on the same logic with which the system recommends tailor-made products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of data abuse - "When you look at what I do" - some are worried about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the company's represented, potential power that is terrifying, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the revolt against power that many internet users encounter with rejection.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of an event, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was the recent action against paedophilia in Brazil, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also made it possible to identify the pedophilia.
However, users concerned with personal rights were able to breathe a sigh of relief in May when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully brought the FBI to justice: thus, Google cannot be forced to release information to the FBI on a secret request with any point of the constitution in the future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but the list of individual users, or their web and search terms list, has been withheld retroactively for two months.)
So Google's image remains controversial: those who reluctantly release their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and private sphere by using Google services, scourge the company with the outrage due to the conservative companies.
However, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is market leader thanks to Windows, even if both struggle for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require identification codes for its users and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems to be far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks see through the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet razor-sharp - a relationship that has come to the fore especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing but collaboration, i.e. the users intentionally leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show itself publicly.
An average youth can simultaneously manage his profile on several community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, can connect it through other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries that are geosted on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove: When looking at the party photos of the past night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend has been enjoying himself with, or the employee is fired because in his blog he is only too honest about his anger about the management of the company - one thing is for sure: The term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Those who lead an online life are what they reveal to themselves - this is how one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And those who try to keep something secret, or even circumvent Google's monopoly, are welcome to do so - such as Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine, but intentionally leaves no traces.
Not a few people deliberately do not register on community sites so that they are not findable, but also Google's online applications, such as text processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
Public opinion, however, anxiously waits for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising space is threatening advertising agencies' revenues, and the fast-paced services are causing worry not only to Microsoft but also to other software developers.
Critical observers, however, also find the disturbing counterpoles: for example, the corporate management rejected a protest from the employees completely after the company's kindergarten fees were doubled, and management also thought that the staff's multiple meals were too expensive. However, all this seems to be mildly opposed to Google even falling to the knees before the Chinese government in 2006 and agreeing with an agreement that all the regime-critical hits, or those that violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The internal regulation of the group is that no new service is advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could again change a lot: While some believe that Google's book and magazine scan or archiving project now assumes dimensions that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather concerned about the "Health" system, which enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database already provides the next generation of sci-fi authors with the material - such as "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian manner a future in which a human being becomes scaryly approachable thanks to Google-related data.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd in the removal of traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people suspected of helping to eliminate the traces, the spokesman of police commissioner Borsod announced on Tuesday.
The young people were responsible and are currently being charged with the aid.
According to the MTI news agency, they are two girls who defend themselves at large.
Aid is punishable by up to five years of imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old resident man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having deliberately murdered several persons out of greed for money.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debt, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor to a site in Ózd, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act by a long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange submits purchase offer for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, has been offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reiterated the offer that the Poles had made despite the fact that they were formerly excluded by the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, intends to sell more than 60% of the shares in the coming months.
According to reports of the Czech daily newspaper "E15", the offer of the Poles contains the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange is probably the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25% stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers already spoke of "second September 11" on Tuesday.
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, for example "La Repubblica" - the president had not even been able to put his own party behind him for the bill, which should bring some relief into the scary situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billion-dollar investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11".
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo", the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the global economy is now on the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and this will affect the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the Congressional vote, there is a threat that Washington has no political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example the Geneva "Day Scoreboard".
While some states could still provide bailout packages to their troubled financial institutions, banks could save from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks go bankrupt, neither further financial injections nor other emergency measures will help.
In the long term, EU member states would have to jump over their shadow and centralise control of the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out to frail financial institutions, the Viennese newspaper "Der Standard" recalls. Moreover, the newspaper continues, the concerns are becoming more realistic that after the Americans, European taxpayers must now take a little deeper into their pockets in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis, which is now sweeping across the old continents like a tsunami.
While the "savers" would not have to "weddle" immediately with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to note in which case it would be reasonable to touch taxpayers' money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop new accident prevention technologies if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
CEATEC in Japan presented an amazing project that inspired the Nissan engineers of bumblebees in the creation of new systems to prevent accidents.
In cooperation with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic system controlled by car robots, a mini car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval "private sector", which is very similar to our own "protective shield", Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, said at the exhibition.
The compound eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision-avoiding process.
The obstacle is registered in fractions of seconds, and the car robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tires around the appropriate angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this manoeuvre takes place purely instinctively.
"If it wasn't, the car robot couldn't react fast enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Car Robot Project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of bees when they avoid other bees.
And this has to take place in a fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to bees, dodging cannot take place up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only towards the maneuverability of the tires.
While there are endless possibilities for the bees here to avoid other bees, the researchers in the car robot were only able to use the rotational motion, or acceleration and deceleration.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer service life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only has to process a few inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It does not have to save them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction based on previous maneuvers, so that it constantly takes up only a handful of KB memory.
There's no need for gigabyte and megabyte-heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan believes will be in production as standard within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately directing the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the destination.
A Name for the Sinning Child
Now there is the written version of the $700 billion rescue package law, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at buying the banks' bad loans.
In the first passage half of the money is to be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local east coast, Congressmen ran through after several days of debates on an agreement on the $700 billion rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American House of Deputies, saying that the agreement had to be put to paper.
Both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain - supported the compromise reached on the rescue package.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said as a result: the programme will be effective and it will be efficient, but one must do more. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about tearing the rudder of the economy around.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening 8 a.m. (Central European time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger an altitude flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Deputies first votes on the 2008 bill to stabilise the economy, then it is the Senate's turn.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
However, the program deviates from the Bush administration's original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once on buying rotten securities that are burdened with credit.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after Congress is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday, which is expected to be spent on the purchase of bad debt securities, and the President is expected to decide on the additional $100 billion.
The programme will be reviewed by a Commission of its own, including the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision of Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-ridden securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be done both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds and companies pay fees corresponding to the expected damage.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds in such a way that up to $700 billion can be provided as emergency aid to the American financial system, be it for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We'll take the necessary steps so that we'll be ready to introduce the law as soon as it's signed, according to Paulson.
However, the chiefs of the banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can expect that their handlings, which are called "Golden Handshake" salopply in the overseas slang, will be cut by the government.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance assists each other.
The reduction essentially means that if the ministry purchases in the context of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the retired bank boss is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the bad loans, the government will engage aggressively to ensure that the management salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes the fact that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions refer only to new agreements, so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in manager salaries are governed by law, Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the measure.
The state gains equity rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank gets better again.
The bill requires the President to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
There were, however, sceptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That is not what the American citizens expect of us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, says the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures have been advanced by the same people who are also responsible for Wall Street collapse.

No more visa to the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the US-Hungarian visa agreement to enter into force on January 12, as the foreign minister declared in front of representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, "everything now depends only on the timely introduction of the electronic immigration or control system overseas."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists will have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be conducting negotiations in Washington from today.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" to the Republic of Hungary, and she also talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bank bailout package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians calling for the resignation of the Secretary of State.
The Congress and government representatives announced after day-long marathon consultations on Sunday morning that they had reached an agreement on the banking rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than their respective opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain's high, which gave him the presentation of vice-president Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, melted away at the same time.
At a campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly adopt the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
"We must act now, responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are being threatened," he said in front of 35,000 viewers.
He has not failed to call McCain's economic visions "obsolete".
In an interview given to the ABC station, McCain stated: "We will all have a hard time with this (...) but doing nothing is certainly no alternative".
The Republican Senator said the plan also required the establishment of a control commission for the finance minister, as well as the restriction of handling for top managers - something he had insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives would probably be voting on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking region
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - this is how "Der Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from it.
The break of epoch is also a problem of Christian democracy, as is the case with Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come to an end, but something came to an end on Sunday, which, however, was already apparent almost exactly ten years ago: the unquestionable hegemony of a state party
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU reached 47.7 percent, falling below the 50 percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. in the much-quoted Stoiber era.
Last but not least, the modernization carried out consistently by the CSU in the federal state has destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but they estimated themselves at a considerable pace. However, the secularization, the educational success, the influx of East and North Germans to the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain without its impact on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation is always accompanied by an increase in options, and this has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and more idiosyncratic.
It is striking that in the last few weeks the classical groups of citizens expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the liberal professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with Abitur as well as university degrees.
Here the support of the CSU decreased to even less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative daily Wiener Tageszeitung reports on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections in its "Who with whom? Party leaders reluctantly on coalition issues".
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ in internal matters.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to talks, while the Greens do not yet want to commit themselves to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, party leaders hardly allowed their cards to look.
SPÖ chief Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership, this is already the case.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP chief as Vice Chancellor.
As he said, the voters voted off the bowl-torture course.
A repetition of this trend would not be possible.
Molterer has, however, reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation cannot be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tries to interfere with the internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party goes into opposition or the coalition is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed within the ÖVP.
BZÖ CEO Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to take over government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, which is being hosted by the Presidency of the European Union, France.
In her speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz Member of the European People's Party, drew particular attention to the segregation of education, which is one of the most serious violations of the rights of Roma children, and was also the main obstacle to their validity.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and citizens' organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to Fidesz’s press office, Járóka has pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma would be displaced from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youths do not have middle school education, and due to poor primary education, only a small part of them can achieve higher education".
Járóka also stressed that education was a fundamental human right, which had a key role to play in asserting other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children could strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
In the view of the honourable Members, it is important that these contexts should be as broad as possible - Roma and non-Roma - aware of them.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase, and through income and VAT they contribute to national spending.
"As EU citizens, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - poor and segregated education must be stopped," said Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member said, a common, target- and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary in order to speed up the de-segregation process in the education sector, and to this end, proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic means to contribute to the future of Europe as a fully entitled citizen," Járóka said.
Since last year's Congress in Berlin, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancement of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at both European and national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on Time
The fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the election debacle, no heads are rolling for the time being, at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates were adjourned.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes will be decided at the extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
However, the much-pulled duo already made it clear that it does not want to stick to their armchairs.
With this they want to appease the angry faction and the party base, which demanded personal consequences one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career peak - the Christian-Social Union reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they could only secure 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was a "one-stop-shop" in Bavaria, which generated 18 percent of German GDP.
Conservatives remain the dominant force in the southern state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party's internal restructuring, the potential successor Huber, Vice President and Federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team, which will conduct exploratory talks with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "Free Voter" about a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of fate is that with the list "Free Voters" the Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-Stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein duo first exploited, in order to then mercilessly dump the determined politician.
The CSU leadership now concentrates all its forces on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings out of the background, will play an active role. Former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman called September 28 the "worst day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few poisonous remarks towards CDU - in his opinion, the CSU would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which contributed a lot to the success at national level in 2005, is not put back on its feet with a joint act of strength, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment about the fiasco, believes that the CSU's loss of terrain will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
At 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result to date in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition made it to the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegality in counting votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
The legislature of the 10 million resident state has been without opposition for decades. Nevertheless, the opposing party, which was gathered under the name of "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections, has seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would "let some opposition members in parliament" this time.
That is why the ODS has even refrained from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent on Russia because of the rising prices of natural gas imports. Loans have even been raised to alleviate the price increases, and the country has also agreed to sell the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading through the country, to the Russians. Therefore, in the context of the opposition's expectations, the hope that Ukraine wants to improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians have banned entry into the EU because of the political system classified as anti-democratic.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections, which focused more on positive movements than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidates from the elections - provided for a temporary relaxation.
However, the OECD's rapid report already criticised the campaign on Monday - thus oppositionists should not be in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in counting votes.
Despite all this, the opposition can see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been freed up, for example, and Minsk is even prepared for minor confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny the recognition of the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine on paper forms a federal state, has seen the two territories as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevich to our paper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to let even one opposition candidate into parliament".
The opposition is not planning any protest measures in the light of the results, but rather is trying to make the need for economic reform clear to voters.
"We have to deal with many problems here - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put stones in the way of distribution, but nevertheless I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones," said Milinkevich, alluding to the fact that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" which is reminiscent of the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," Milinkevich says.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, Head of the Community of Independent States Mission, told the Ria Novosti News Agency: "People believe the actions, not the words." The absence of opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast will be served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are rotatable doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
As of today, the measure will come into force against those wise men who first stamp and then drink coffee during working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
">"Turnable doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," underlines Brunetta once again.
The Palazzo Chigi ends the installation in all the buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides".
All in all, there is now no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
The Minister of Rome announces that "in three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people per year are present at work".
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration.
"whose wage dynamics - according to the minister - have been twice as large over the last 8-10 years as the private sector and well above the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have joined forces to counter the Brunetta Decree as part of the Codacons-backed appeal.
"While the Minister of the Public Service is standing out with figures about lower absenteeism at work - the Consumer Centre writes - the people of the 'active sloths' are growing continuously.
Indeed, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have joined forces to declare war on the unlawful norms of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick worker, during which verification visits can be made and further aspects of the Minister's innovations are challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day, 2500 accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain for life.
For the year 2007, data from the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul Lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were about 1200.
These figures demonstrate the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all the provinces of Italy will celebrate the 58th National Day for the Victims of Accidents at Work in order to draw the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention in the workplace is," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del Lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention at the workplace, to the protection of injured workers, to aid the families of the victims and to raising public opinion".
"An outraged "basta" has risen to this; understandable in tragedies that, measured by their magnitude, cause some vortex in the media and public sympathy. However, everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is definitely also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness of the educational context are of particular importance for young people who feed the world of work.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to distract it from its social seriousness. It is necessary to enforce and improve a legislative standard.
For his part, the President of Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which insults the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards firm rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not exclude the fact that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," stresses President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention, which is exactly what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How do you think that you are doing far too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight against it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate the workers who are already starting at school".
"Another effort is needed - he adds - in terms of communication and awareness-raising of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency is in demand".
Mercandelli also referred to "the progressive deterioration of protection for the victims of work accidents" and denounced the "abolition of the social system against which we are fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the employee a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or random donations that are currently decided by a legislator".
Mp3 player on charge: danger of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which cites the opinion of the Csrseri (scientific committee on current and recently identified health risks) in a report published today in Brussels.
"The report – according to one note – makes it clear that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music equipment for at least five years a week for more than one hour a day risk permanent loss of their hearing".
"I am worried that such a large number of young people, who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume, will irretrievably damage their hearing without knowing it," says Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings – as it is said on the part of the Eu – show a clear risk that pushes too fast action.
What really matters is to raise consumer awareness and make this information common.
In the light of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology".
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"Scientists - as the EU Communication concludes - confirm that there is a legitimate concern and that the European Commission, together with the other EU members and stakeholders, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music equipment and similar equipment".
There is already a European standard which limits the level of noise from portable music equipment to 100 dB, and concerns about the damage that could result from too much noise.
This damage can be very limited by resorting to solutions such as reducing volume and length of noise exposure.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the Eu points out that when users of portable music devices hear loud (less than 89 decibels) music only five hours a week, so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who exceed this limit risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This represents 5-10% of users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Roma, Alemanno kicks off the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We're starting today, it's supposed to be over in March, we're taking stock in June.
This is the procedure laid down by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome". The Commission met this morning in the new headquarters behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months' time, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the leadership lines for Rome.
Once the project has been completed, the City Council and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present in June the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Lord Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it", - stresses Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain the city and the municipal council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a great project for Rome.
Their task will be completed in March and the Commission will be dissolved, as such a project must have a time-limited end point.
In June - as the Lord Mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission".
Anyone who questions the competence of the Commission, since their opinion is lacking in commitment, responds to Alemanno: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers high-quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time in mind in order to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective".
The Lord Mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will make us think. It will occupy the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to allow our city a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step into the future".
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, which "will not only restrict itself in the current local borders, but will look much further", not only in terms of the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here’s a statement
A well-known American politician, who is keen to be seen as independent, has written: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-american president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the US economy and maintained relations with the enemy Islam (and still does so today as a private man)".
The attacks on Obama are getting more and more violent, right now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote in an Internet page: "This person is full of ambition.
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he will be given the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!".
But actually these attacks don't have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a big head start.
In this case, too, there are people who speak to the heart and not to the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the poll booth will we know who the real American patriot will give his vote to.
Here comes a mentality of the USA, which has been kept hidden to the last.
"Tell us what you want, then we'll decide who we're going to do, whether for Obama or McCain".
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before – only now that the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were questioned: What mistakes did Bush make during his term of office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the butt.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains Bush’s weakness for the majority.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not express any real concern about the general credibility of the information on those responsible.
You don't feel alone like you used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, there are the major problems caused by the cuts to the newsroom, i.e. the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that has to be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if one wants to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from shrinking substantially.
A clear but complicated pessimism today fills the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the printing press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area, executives even account for 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in which direction the web goes.
The most important publishing groups make their way into the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping "it will bring something good for journalism".
The biggest crack in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters working for them.
56% of editors at national level are sure their reporters share their values with them, while at local level they are only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "security at work".
Managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
In the case of journalists, it is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", ed.) is always a topical topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and Internet operators, employers offer as they like it and so it becomes a matter of taking it or leaving it.
The editors often get very high wages, whereas the editor can sometimes only get 10000 euros per month, plus pension and insurance money.
As far as vacation is concerned, the matter becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, in order to finally reach 15 holidays after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they admit themselves, often become "sick" throughout the year.
It's a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA STAFF IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Court's Second Trial Chamber in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the real estate agent's application to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
Coppola is investigated for Bankrot in the context of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (against which the prosecutor's office had spoken) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and to obtain evidence against him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already emerged a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the White House's $700 billion savings package: a large part of Americans were and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms yesterday's issue of The New York Times, which reports on how the crisis in progress divides the Republican party, which is increasingly splitting into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored state institutions and business community, and those neoconservatives hostile to "them in Washington" and the financial world, and, above all, winning voters in the south and the center of states.
This part of the party owes its rise above all to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
However, this example, just mentioned, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake is or is already about to bring about: not only in the United States, but also throughout the West, and perhaps beyond that, will they be affected by it.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-afraid events that are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheard-of renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis is a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close links with foreign countries and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the wealth of households living in a single state.
This is a direct political problem for governments: how to behave towards the families concerned, which are also an enormous mass of voters.
The crisis thus appears economically global, whereas politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have gone out of hand and lost its right to speak: the clear proof of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into different national and international conflicts, cannot find a common path.
Therefore, everyone now anticipates the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and above all distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became increasingly serious, only the US is in the economic situation to save itself without foreign help.
In addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus, two conditions that cannot be overvalued – under certain circumstances – which no international organisation or market will otherwise be able to rely on in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance which recently has been associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, when we were so convinced that we had long since entered a networked empire, a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of intangibles, it is precisely now that we must suddenly see how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can certainly all be transported from one place to another in the world, but they are still connected to a narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is in favor of another who lives in a cropless, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short insert.
Who territory, who government, who says politics, thus also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leaderships, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing leaderships, especially those of economics, which have turned out to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
In addition, there is a deeper and, in a sense, still disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an intolerance, an image of inefficiency, a sense of remoteness, all of which is directed at an entire class of Western managers.
It seems to be the conviction among large parts of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is more and more alien and traditional to the majority.
The demand for leadership is thus fueling a branched but powerful movement of the disempowerment of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in the sudden reversal of the collective state of mind of recent times: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, towards the rebellion of American MPs against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, have more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value regarding what is going on today in the lower social strata of the West and is being intensified and driven by the financial crisis to over-dimensionality.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that lets go up on walls
Defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have almost reached the target.
With an adhesive applied on an area of only 2.5 sqcm, the researchers succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged into a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials, such as glass Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the reptile's feet' holding ability and, at the same time, "is easily removed from the wall," says Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a transitory adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe so, but the researchers think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall within the space sector.
So for the moment the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH – the University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to a new type of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, California scientists present a microfibre adhesive that, like hair, cleans itself from the dust by moving on a surface and thus always retains perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Be careful of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These beverages, which are consumed mainly in the summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of both packaged and fresh fruit juices in connection with medication intake. During the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again sounded the alarm: it is enough to have a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs to the extent that they are practically eliminated and thus endanger the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
MEDICALS IN DRIVER – In a report two years ago, the same agency had warned doctors and patients of the dangers of this mix and stressed the need to take care of what is being drunk in connection with drugs such as diazepan or metadon.
It's NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers, who are thus free to change consumer information.
It is therefore recommended to read the package leaflet at all times and, if there is still some ambiguity, to ask a pharmacist or a doctor," the Ansa agency's expert stresses.
Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event had been more crucial to the history of the United States than the assassinations.
A prediction that received quite a few polemics in response and was still held before the economist years later, but is proving to be completely correct today.
"I am surprised and shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the public eye," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economician of great value", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style, particularly directed against the Bush administration's excessive liberalism."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package appears
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source software, as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office, is gaining an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself to the public with some novelties: in addition to a revised and now Spartan designed initial menu, a completely guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x has finally been achieved, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
In addition, the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice, has been taken into account.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes sending via email easier. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphics editing modules and at the same time preserve the original appearance of the page.
So you can now generate "hybride" PDF files, which expand the typical graphics of Adobe format by the elements of a table and a text processing system.
The collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited several hands by different users, thus avoiding conflicts in the case of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a question in order to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently releasing various OpenOffice features on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result is to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download on the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
However, if the cost-free nature of the programme can be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme in private households, it is also particularly in the area of business where OpenOffice could succeed: after all, various public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program aimed at pushing Excel; Impress, for creating presentations such as with PowerPoint; Dbase for operating databases instead of the more known access; and most recently Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a target that can be easily exceeded with already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Also Kohl tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens as part of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is third-classified and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver to be tested positively for Cera, the third-generation Epo. Previously, this was already the case with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the Kohl blood samples are among those carried out in the last weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
Confirming the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and, according to the Associated Press, also notified the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME IMMIGRATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES IS: IS ITALY RASSISTICAL?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only welcomed with reluctance.
Does this make Belpaese a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article devoted entirely to the theme of racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Burkina Faso-born Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after stealing a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times calls the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are those where "most integration and job opportunities" exist, yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega north is recorded".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that the Pope and the President also underline: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope to cooperate between the Church and the State to combat racism at a meeting at the Quirinal."
Students Victims of up to 900-Euro per room high rental rates
The student housing market is not in crisis.
According to the latest investigation by the Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious features, and entire groups of students are in fact losing their right to study, as their families are unable to support them at this level," said Sunia, Laura Mariani, responsible for this, "in these cities, the high demand from the students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also harmed the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, without rental price limit, unauthorized subletting.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which lead to lower rental prices through a revision of taxation.
A closer look at the investigation shows that in Milan, a sleeping space in the Brianza district is needed for about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends at 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera districts, or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a sleeping place costs an average of 350/400 euros, and a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the neighbourhoods around the university, 250/280 euros are needed for a sleeping place of need, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighbourhoods around the university are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rents in the neighbourhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who dodge in the suburbs can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting out to non-European students is more frequent, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: rents that are 25-30% higher than the average are required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema – the cities close their historic cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the favored multiplexkinos.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture by director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening at the moment in the major urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of the exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, means in the long run death for the one-room cinema in the centre. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the features of a cultural crime.
It is mostly historical places full of memories, "it is like losing a friend with whom one has travelled a piece of street full of emotions", according to the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", which 20 years ago earned him the Oscar and the great prize of Cannes. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a cinema world that is probably lost forever.
The figures supplied by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas has had to close; most of these mines paid for cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This proves that the main culprits are the multiplexkinos, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: at 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the lists, 81 are in Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romagna.
"Business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "although it is useful that new structures also emerge, the first priority is the preservation of the already existing one, because if a hall closes in the city, not all its regular customers are willing to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here remains the lack of budget for the funds of the trade association external eight: the debt burden recorded by the state amounts to about 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to preserve the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be necessary".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to have decided to protect the old cinemas by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and support the traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the planned measures are also tax breaks for cinema operators, as well as benefits for the public in terms of local transport: it will be allowed to travel to the traffic-limited areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
"It is a good initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also develop new concepts.
Of course, we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to do something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because after all, the audience of today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closing of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; when I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside to avoid seeing the dusty posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the municipality's decisions to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The accusations made by the Anti-Mafia Office of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the Municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
In handcuffs were also taken Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the clan's boss, had already been convicted of involvement in criminal associations of the mafia, at that time to a compensation sum of 10 million euros.
"Regarding every kind of moral and legal norm," the lawyers wrote, "the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli funds for consulting activities."
"The Mafia group had thus been made possible – according to the judges – to enter the town halls on an official way and to co-determine the politics of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional committee Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encountering links between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the Mafia's concentration is greater than in others where such links are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who maintain a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to the police, the clan Piromalli was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, Gioia Tauro's municipal council had been dissolved, but as early as 1991 – and even then due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration – local politicians had been deprived of their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after the May 2006 run-off election.
He screamed scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused Vice-Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of inventing everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges state in connection with this morning's arrest warrant that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
A wiretapping campaign in connection with the Dal Torrione case investigation has shown the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – making public administration measures identical to the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes out of the waves, the big ones suddenly start running
It is a non-depleting source of money that covers over 70% of the planet's surface and only now do the world's major energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that are now all looking at, and are also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of generating energy from ocean movements has been under consideration and studied for 70 years; not by chance, these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of ocean energy was gassed, but now environmental organizations and increased oil prices are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy needs could be met by the energies generated by ocean waves.
This would be twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and tides are added.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy sector are now relying on marine energy generation.
"Chevron investigates these technologies" – according to the spokesman of a company known to the US giant in the Wall Street Journal – and weighs the opportunity to work with us."
This is about obtaining a permit from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign that should not be underestimated, especially given that, especially in Alaska, oil continues to be mined by the US and President Bush recently launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; even if the details are not known, observers are talking about an increasing interest.
Even better technologies.
Experts are talking about an emerging technology, not least because the last doubts have not yet been clarified by environmentalists.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small scale and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a far greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the floats via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned plants of this type, which are only waiting for state approval. Part of the energy gained could also be used for military facilities.
However, Verdant Power is already producing energy for a department store and a park latz using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feeds the generator through the resulting rotary motion.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Production Research, a particular interest currently deserves the potential that is in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is especially tidal energy that led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
