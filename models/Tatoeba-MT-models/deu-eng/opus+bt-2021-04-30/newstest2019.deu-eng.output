DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that of course depends on the fact that you get into conversation with him once, that you also talk to him about why he obviously felt one or the other as stated in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmower" of the "Image Newspaper.
Despite the month-long debate about the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92 times national player Özil.
"I would have liked Mesut Özil to continue playing for Germany.
I also assumed up to a certain point that this would be the case," said Grindel.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and had also justified it on the grounds that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change clubs, you talk about it with your coach and I find it a pity that this conversation has not come about so far".
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 2:13 p.m., the professional fire brigade in Linz was alerted to a fire on the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was in default.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire at the arrival.
The roof had to be removed practically completely and fire rubble removed to the extent absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery attached to the store for lunch.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the range of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, for the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends himself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the street
What has led Lindsay Lohan to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself streamed live as she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family who wants her to be a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults of trafficking children.
She doesn't provide any evidence for all of this in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan is listening to in the video as she pursues the family further down the street.
Apparently, she's trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan slaps her face.
With tears, the actress asserts how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe started in Japan in December 2014.
It is supposed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 victims are reported.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet entered the devastated and cut off areas of the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Chief
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla chief Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletro car maker.
The U.S. stockbrokers sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain CEO.
British Conservative Party Congress
Sharply guarded - the Tories Party Congress
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is supposed to focus on foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already reached agreement
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name doublings for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on it this Sunday - whether it is okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("Der nicht") - meant Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" presents itself as an anti-system candidate and is thus at the forefront of the polls.
His sharpest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," said Peter Mertens, Development Board member, to the "Automobilwoche" industry journal.
In December 2017, the incarcerated and leaved Audi boss Rupert Stadler announced that the task force would soon be disbanded.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we achieved an important milestone in the reworking of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer had made "gravely organisational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board adjourned a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and intends to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust values after the emission fraud became known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Bram Schot, Chief Sales Officer, manages the company as Acting Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there were production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronner Stimme".
In principle, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electric mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, 15,000 reservations are already available.
Grindel aspires to re-election - Lahm shall be in the DFB-Presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for office as DFB President next year.
"I do my work and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early on Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again to re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association would find it "advisable" if he did not "like to work on the future project" after the contract for the Football-EM 2024.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Federal Day on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB-Presidium.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to consult the Bureau in this role and then of course be invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether lame could become his successor as DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migration background should become the integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is held by native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says "the issue is important, we have to take care of it", this would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs where integration must work," said Grindel.
Correctly remove with half-wise scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that measures not only my weight, but also the body fat content.
They can also display muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the sausage.

Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin started the new basketball league season with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up easily won 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
New additions Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliner with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators at his compulsory game debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the obligatory debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower at the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg pro Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.
Last year's playoff semifinalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was with 24 points most hit-safe shooter in the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
With the Basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings surpassed the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Braunschweigers, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to hand over supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We'll protect our citizens no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, Cologne's city centre had been partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were in action - including snipers.
The Islam Association Ditib is in criticism because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Scaring Seconds
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have been promoting greater commitment to fighting poverty and disease at a joint concert at Central Park in New York.
"Commit wherever you can," Mendes said at the night of Sunday at the festival in front of around 600,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations, also appeared on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a fright second when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was gunshot, got scared, and tried to escape.
In a short time panic arose, people ran confused.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said event organiser Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed people down from the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Those who wanted to get one had to read texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases on the Internet and spread them.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - booh calls for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He and his democratic colleague Chris Coons spoke out on the stage for greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke out in the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, thus hitting many women's minds.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse to the point of attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women who claimed to have experienced sexual assaults themselves confronted him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also come together with me in an elevator at any time," Flake said at the concert in New York to the crowd.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends expulsion of journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellor's Office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had overlaid a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had entered the first row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disruption of the press conference.
The action of the journalist caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
He had therefore ordered personal protectors to take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies entirely irrespective of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged spying activities or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades of imprisonment.
Also foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities: Only in early September the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but there are still trials against them in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz totally drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at that twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for its lively conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller encounters with her guests some beer, some wine or even higher-percent drinks to loosen the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory singing inlays.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Horniest Day".
However, the trip to the far north was not good for the Municher.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely cuddled on it, the eyes only two small slits left.
The bed selfie shows a completely worn out Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's just got a powerful hangover.
Directed to his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER goes to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And spray.
And the round of egg liqueurs that Ina throws at half past three, let go.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips on how to fight the aftershocks.
They ranged from instant broth, fish buns or - probably the most effective - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
It is not known how Ina Müller survived the nightly booze.
However, as she has been hosting the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa is struggling with vandalism and rubbish
The entrance to the 36 kilometer long railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa presents itself hard to find and littered.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Shards, cigarette dumps, garbage and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with seating group to the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
A more than inglorious sight for the showpiece Bahnradweg in Rotkäppchenland.
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to Ulrich Wüstenhagen, the cycling officer of the city.
The problem had already been raised in the cycling council.
So far, there has been no solution.
The proposals ranged from the laying of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also included the topic in the local advisory council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting point for parties on weekends.
It is not only often loud, but also destroyed in the racks: posts are torn out of the ground, trash cans are demolished, signs are overturned, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
However, the actions were only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are angry that the rest area on the cycle path in Treysa is the meeting point for drinking.
"The focus is clearly on the Haaße Hill along the entire cycle path," confirms the cycling officer, who is now also concerned about the new cycle site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it gets really expensive".
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this sets the threshold significantly higher to attack common property.
However, this would assume that a police patrol will arrive in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße-Hügel.
It had to be made more attractive.
One could be very satisfied with the frequency of the bike path so far.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical hazard, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no turning track on the Haaße Hill.
In the event of busy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic flows on both sides," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and together.
To present "D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for Big and Small, Young and Experienced Musicians".
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family gathering with coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the cultural station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-standing albather living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
According to District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, this contest is a novelty.
We have not yet experienced this in other parts of the city.
What did the writers see connected to?
Lake Hiltruper and Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned in the villages.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his striking song.
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Time and again it was about experiencing together in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about her work.
So they learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
Franke knew from the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann to report that he recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed a lot on YouTube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper Gastronomy.
There was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others can listen to their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Himig with his Hiltrup hit, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of them, the children also performed again in the finals - and even without electronic support sounded "rightly good", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchy melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year anniversary.
She rated the event as a complete success.
Everyone is "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams facing each other.
For each page there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which you - the old trick with the red foil - can only decipher when you have put them in.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read anything by mistake.
For example, the maps read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
Second window.
3. Cubes.
4th Festival".
These are the terms that have to be encrypted from now on.
Because here the concepts are not to be guessed, but codes.
Alternately one player per team is the encrypter.
He gets a code card that might say "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto", the terms behind the secret foil are not to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube", "fest" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not know as far as possible; because this wins the game if he succeeds twice in cracking the code.
The encryptor notes and reads aloud: "throwing" for the dice, "loose" as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like "party" would also be possible and "Prague" because he has been watching in school and knows the window collapse there.
That's how it goes round by round, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the opposite side - but it can get together better with every hint that the encrypter gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, so the rewrites should be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic part of "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it quite long and extensively until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But those who have just started will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre prime "Codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game of few words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if it's just about guessing and not winning points, it's also easy to invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harassed guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach twice during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed Hitler's greeting in the Upper City of a passing police patrol, later he also noticed in the Upper City in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In a sober state, he must also be prosecuted for the use of marks of unconstitutional organisations.
Pressig plant was home to the Schubloks
The railway depot in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
A piece of railway history ended in 1991.
"When buffers banged on buffers, you heard it all over the press," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes also squealed and the wagons squealed.
That was pure railroad.
Statements that are symbolic of Dinkel's home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which has its peak point in Steinbach am Wald after an ascent of about 220 metres in altitude.
In order to cope with this, train and drawer locomotives were formerly needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, overhead line and railway mastery.
"The centrepiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and professional railway operator for 47 years.
From the railway depot (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also locomotives for the secondary routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben were operated.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the 1939 line already minimized the need for train and push locomotives.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
Up to 1991, at least 10,000 weighings were still placed per month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were broken down, and in 1991 the rest were broken down.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that one has not envisaged a better use of the site, also in terms of freight transport".
At Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 Years of Electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," remembers Georg Dinkel.
A little later the end.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig marshalling station was history.
"The shunters and inhibitors did the most difficult work in train traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Any misstep would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as Julia Görges had done before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhsten or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Victory led 6:3, 4:2 against Dariah Kassatkina, when the Russian woman placed at number 13 gave up.
The Swabian is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the "Art and Pleasure" series, a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach on the weekend.
With great relief, registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Pleasure".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A great visitor appeal showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He's been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
A little surprising, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his task into proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have already actively participated in the selection of artists in the past and have helped shape flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Art & Pleasure, there is again a 70-cent special postage stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austazen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased about the high support of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical frame.
While walking through the spacious garden, it quickly becomes clear to the visitor that the title "Windspiel-Performance" challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of metal or ceramics, often with colour accents.
The "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau, awaits the visitor at the entrance to the property on the right.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully equipped with 20 wind girdles, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun shining through the bushwork in the background, the object seems to be magically calm and invites you to linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental, who prefers to devote herself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
On half way Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy image of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" to wander through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians also breathed their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more Sangesleben in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in the Tinnenbusch they took the MGV 68 Albachten out of the christening.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter".
"It will be full today," Chairman Jürgen Holstiege suspected, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanian singers.
Especially for the anniversary they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
On time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it became, festive clothes had been requested before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Encounter", but comfortably at tables.
In between, movement was needed: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled the controls on and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honor that the singers of the MGV 68 made the voice sound themselves.
Happy songs were a fitting occasion.
Almost already put: "Such a day, as beautiful as today".
Matching the exquisite grape juice many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In allusion to another cool drink sounded "Humulus lupulus", which is the Latin term for "hops".
Again, the choir director of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time, was sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said, "He has such an easy way, it's a masterpiece that he does." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves vocally.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until 3 a.m. to create his own rhymes.
Andreas Winterhoff also presented good-sounding poetry.
There was also a big raffle.
The proceeds are intended to finance a visit to the Allwetterzoo to the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The ascender is marching.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is really well suited in League Three.
No sign of shyness or fracks, the independents do their thing.
And this is really good at 3-0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city rival BW Aasee.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we've already made an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer the mood was good, the game was ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring this to the finish line, such a game can already tip," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its experienced forces and brought the full yield to the finish line.
"We all know who's on the other side of a derby like that.
That doesn't break our necks.
I have seen really good volleyball in phases," Annacker did not quarrel with the 0:3 - and immediately moved on to the agenda.
Where the journey for the independents goes, seems not foreseeable after just three days of playing.
"It's just too soon for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball." In any case, they no longer want to look downwards to the fourth league.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they will have to look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will take place in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dreamship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she openly talks about the fact that the series might have had a complicity in her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chief Hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Dreamship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left forever.
The series, which made her a star, could also be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many colleagues I admired perceived me on an equal footing," Keller tells in conversation with the "picture on Sunday".
At first she had always been only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "dreamship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so much".
She considers it possible that her husband at the time might have been quite envious, but "like many men, Hans was also afraid of conversations about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried to be "the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he did not want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have disguised myself", as she further explains.
She had always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, whom I was in truth never, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding, I sat crying in the dressing room and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody also failed.
Why didn't it ever work with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had the love at that time "as imagined in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love far too naively".
The night moth, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ resort Zurich, has ventured to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little shy of light.
And the glaring glow in which a green carpet is dipped in the six-ring square blinds him exceedingly.
But it's just a film festival, because more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening he staggers over the square in order to lighten up in the "Aquaclean WC oasis".
This is the name given to the public toilet system sponsored by a large sanitation company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: The "Needsanstalt" on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to radiate a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks in the men's oasis for some reason to heaven.
So get out here, across to the other side of the street: invited guests, who just entertained at the best level in the cinema next door to the opening film "Green Book", celebrate the festival start with a party in the three-storey department store as every year.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: The works shown come from all over the world.
What you don't have to come up with in an article about this festival in order not to fall into sneak advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a volumel around the feeler, which has given him a good fairy, and two bully bouncers wave him in actually generously.
Inside, the invited people crowd, dance to live music far after midnight, or let themselves be pretended by DJ rhythms to which they yell at each other, and rinse down exquisite snacks with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement oysters wait for slurring mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut open, a chocolate fountain gushes.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The moth studies the sign at the escalator: "Bring a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If that's two separate instructions, he got lost in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it's certainly already saved lives.
In the upper floor household goods department, the poultry darts a cocktail prepared with espresso called the "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who's been advertising for the brand for years, isn't here that night either.
But there is a face that is known to the observer, between local celebrities, cash desks and kitchen items: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main character shouldn't be far.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd, with almost sixty almost like a choirboy.
He's not being talked to, he's not being gawked, he's being shuddered at the most.
Especially for this restraint, gladly misunderstood as a restraint, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is pleased about the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to Cumbia rhythms with a player in the cabin, as seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, cheered by the players.
The Mexican second division had defeated the Leones Negros 2–0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: League 1: ASV Sending after last minute broke "destructed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball club ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His protégés were "destructed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long periods, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we totally overslept", the ASV trainer annoyed.
The landlords carried fast with 8:1, also the early time out which Bieletzki had taken, did not fruit at first.
"Then suddenly a jerk went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter hour.
For the break, the gap was only two goals.
Above all Sendes Bester, Marius Hintze, hit in the phase one by one.
After the change it became even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst struck out at 15:15, followed by the relay changer leading almost consistently.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Intrude the impartial into the action.
Bieletzki usually avoids trying to blame others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff collected, "was a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well in the back against seven men and threw again and again at the empty goal.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory must come," said Bieletzki, completely serving.
ASV gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - Police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an then 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the woman's remains.
Relief forces dug up a road near Marxgrün on Saturday.
To this end, the pavement and several layers of it were removed, as police and prosecutors shared.
According to new evidence, the missing person may have been buried not far from their place of residence at that time.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court, together with the prosecutor's office, has been working intensively again on the case.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Heritage Protection Authority, the investigators encountered an anomaly under the road near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers lurk on the net.

Elon Musk, founder of electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatening resignation as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. stock exchange supervisor SEC filed a lawsuit out of court over misleading Twitter news in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and Musk also resigns from the office of Chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Chairman of the Supervisory Board.
He is allowed to remain chairman of the board.
In the settlement, which still needs to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager before the U.S. Federal Court Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, who is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is aware of no guilt
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed at the lawsuit.
He had always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange and pay 420 dollars per share, the funding being secured.
That would have made Tesla a total of 72 billion dollars.
Later Musk rowed back: Tesla remains on the stock exchange.
Following the agreement, Tesla will now have to find an external chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp team 1:1 at Chelsea FC

Record champion Manchester United is slipping deeper and deeper into the crisis after the worst start of the season since 1989.
The team of controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United earning 1:3 (0:2) and remains in the middle of the table with ten points after seven match days only.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of the Champions League match against FC Valencia on Tuesday.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno came to his first Premier League appearance after an injury to Petr Cech.

Polls: 46 percent do not want Merkel as chancellor by 2021
After the querels of the past weeks, the GroKo collects several survey low blows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overhauled the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one counter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and ends up at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value so far for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If Bundestag elections were held on Sunday, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the votes, according to Emnid.
This means that the grand coalition has currently lost the majority on the Sunday issue at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently reach 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
Together, they received 53.4 percent in the 2017 Bundestag election.
Among the other parties, the range is also large: The AfD, the second strongest party in several polls, reaches 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens achieve votes of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the percentage of votes cast.
But also the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has fallen significantly since the 2017 federal election.
At present, only 48 percent of citizens find Merkel to be the right person in the chancellor's office, as the Emnid survey on behalf of BamS showed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) would like the grand coalition to hold until the next regular Bundestag election in three years, 41 percent being in favour of a new election.
A further survey published on Saturday also revealed significant losses in popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also judge whether Merkel should again run for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against.
As a result, 64 per cent of the Union's supporters do not want a candidacy, 35 per cent do not want a candidacy.
Hanging at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk to Aldi about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of the digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co. the supermarket as a place of acquaintance for the great love radiates almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short snacks at the counter or the favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being not so much a contact but rather a slippery stock market.
We dared the test: How do women react, you don't talk long around the bush in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood Lovestory potential has it when love happiness is preceded by an out-of-eyes lost-and-found plot.
If the guy calls his adored friend at the email address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, it sounds like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Konsorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
For example, the author of this advertisement in an Aldi branch that is unknown to us would like her to find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat", as well.
For her belief in the magic of analogue acquaintance, she has definitely earned her Happy End à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has been involved in the action "Deckel gegen Polio - 500 Lid für eine Leben ohne politäten".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The condition described in German as polio leads from paralysis to death.

The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be controlled by vaccinations, as a press release says.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about form and fitness by Mario Götze.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That doesn't do the boy any good.
And that doesn't do us any good," said Götze-friend Reus after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen at the TV station Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry in contract talks with Hecking

"But there will certainly be the moment where we sit down and talk," Eberl said on Sunday night on the TV channel Sky.
Football: District League: Researcher appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his own.
Wortkarg gave himself up, coach of the football district club VfL Wolbeck, first retreated (innerly) to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
It's all history.
Meanwhile, it runs around the Brandhoveweg again.
Taufrischer proof is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only breath-thinly passed the ascent.
Yes, I'm very pleased with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and visited every single one of them after the match to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg came - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited for balls in the front line.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost that would have taken revenge when the SCA hit dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box in minute 41 twice in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his discipline.
After the break, the VfL took over the full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed narrowly.
Schroer also came too late in a Thewes entry after 58 minutes.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch of the left side missed another fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the Platzherren 18 meters in front of the guest enclosure.
The fouled himself and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right flap struck down left from the shooter's point of view - 1-0 (71.).
20 minutes, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty room in the 80th minute unhappily.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79th).
Bange Minuten had to survive Wolbeck in the final stage before Geske still had the victory hit on the push in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4–1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five match days - that could not be enough for coach Adi Hütter.

Helicopters crashed in Kottingbrunn
On landing, the accident occurred at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m., a drama occurred at the airfield in Kottingbrunn on Sunday.
When a helicopter landed, there was turbulence, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was captured by a gust of wind, crashed onto the ground and came to a standstill laterally.
Police, rescue and fire services were immediately notified.
With a large contingent, the forces came to the disaster site.
The ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one property damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to go home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of the investigation.
According to firefighter Franz Resperger, there was a small fire that could quickly be extinguished.
Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female on September 1st, as the report "The Power of Monoculture" shows, which will be officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and which was pre-selected by the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pull past them," said Endowed Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male-occupied management teams - with few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
The gap makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented compared.
It's a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies was also due solely to positive impulses for the medium value index (MDax) companies.
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
At the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again next year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signaled that they would not continue to make a commitment to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
A different picture emerges from the supervisory boards: As of 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"Every year, just as many women were recruited for the board of directors, a 40 percent share would have been achieved already in 2023," the report says.
Some even make mischief: Luxury bodies: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
It's the best way to earn Ferrari.
The Italians take in 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the noble providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers charge per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and business professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros operating profit with every car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, while Tesla and Bentley even have a strong impact on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices ranging from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros earnings before interest and taxes EBIT.

You can be proud of this," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later symbolically met the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many people have found their way to Abtswind again." Later, "The Troglauers" caused the mood.
On Sunday, on which Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had set the drinks prices as 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A festive evening for the 60th Wine Festival will take place on Friday, 5th October, in the guest's house, before going into the second round one day later in the marquee.
In Bonn: Emergency car crashes in taxi
An ambulance stands badly damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passer-by has been fatally injured.
When emergency doctors are called, they are supposed to help - best to save people's lives.
Such a rescue trip took a deadly end for a 26-year-old in Bonn.
Bonn - In the collision of an ambulance with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and her driver were seriously injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the ambulance car had run a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then bumped into an intersection with the taxi that was driving at Green.
The doctor's car hurled against a traffic light pole and a tree after the collision.
He captured the passer-by who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of the ambulance and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from emergency forces.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also severely injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another emergency doctor called in tried this - but without success.
The three severely injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn prosecutor's office, investigate who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we find it uncomfortable
After the disgraceful end in the league cup, Manchester United is now also losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1:3. The way of defeat should still give way to talk.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute, in which the reborn Marko Arnautovic shot the 3–1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all of Manchester's defensive players stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of a previously insufficient performance over long distances.
The mood at United's city rival Manchester City is very different at the moment.
The Citizens, coached by Mourinho's big competitor Pep Guardiola, came against Brighton & Hove Albion to a rough 2–0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through for the home team for the first time the defense bar of the geek.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former goal scorer, ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1–2 defeat in the league cup, Xherdan Shaqiri won a 1:1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
Like the Cup-off, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man with the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who came on the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, barely missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After the Reds had started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea was not to be beaten for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and now the Reds in the League plunged the Blues Liverpool from the top of the league.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2–0 wins.
However, fans of the Gunners, in which Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success report against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defenseman Craig Cathcart unhappily bugged Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal passed Watford due to the fifth consecutive victory and is now in 5th place behind the big rival Tottenham.A strong impression continues to be left to uplifter Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained undefeated in the 2–0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and finished 8th.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show in the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no issue, yet ever-present: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let go of the German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be presenting their new products in the French capital, together with competitors from all over the world.
The diesel doesn't really play a big role in this anymore.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should still be an important topic at least behind the brilliant backdrops of the trade fair booths.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have among other things their first pure electric models: The e-tron of the Ingolstädter will be on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
Both have been officially presented.
BMW's iNext is not scheduled to start until 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3 Series.
This year, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which is celebrating its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a good one million visitors came.
At least 380 people have died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi during the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and traffic connections are damaged, there has been enormous damage to property.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke in over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims will increase significantly.
So far, the figures are only from Palu.
However, numerous other communities are also affected - along the west coast of Sulawesi.
About 150 bikers celebrate divine service in Werdohl
Motorrad-Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final divine service for the motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking with a team of helpers on Sunday.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for the bikers was on the agenda.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong two-wheeler drivers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) at the Nordhelle House takes place on the last Sunday of a month.
Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to celebrate a worship that was far from ordinary.
Already from 10 o'clock the Bolids were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker early school was on the program and it was possible to strengthen itself with coffee and cakes or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given by Rev. Dirk Grzegorek during the Biker service.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical background.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill tends to beat poetically calm tones," said Father Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle worship yesterday.
Fuchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a big celebration: after the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active at the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also attracted great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his amazed spectators step by step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and had them fill the apples in the large funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how this would become a tasty drink.
But they could also look at this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
Wrapped in moulds and covered in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which look a little like chippings, layer by layer.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the breeder farmer also had already finished bottled specialties with him.
So he opened his treasure chest and presented the latest feather whites to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Fuchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents came into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discover the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Actives of the Fugtorfer comradeship of former soldiers also engaged in the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
The home club will also offer an action day in the coming year.
Then, however, according to Gregor Krützkamp, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the events.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious due to the issue: finally, it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season-pile: "Fucking situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in succession, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
However, there was not much positive before in the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," said 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "That's disappointing, of course, because you always do a lot of work".
The further victoryless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met to the connection, stand with two meters at the very bottom and are in their current constitution a candidate for relegation.
Guided by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated the first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals for the DFB cup winner in front of 46,300 spectators, who advanced to the middle of the table with seven points after the successful final for the Europa League match against Lazio Rom.
Croatia's runner-up world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse in his debut, and never got a grip on Hanover's defenses.
The striker, who was long beaten after the World Cup, showed with his speed and assertiveness why he was so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was loaned by Liverpool FC, was also the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurter, which began in a swing.
Lucas Torró's (17th) headball on the net of the goal brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in promising position at the last moment by the 96-defence around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term failed Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty room after a repelled corner, Haller extended by head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to hold the foot.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defensive player from French second division club AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt fell even before the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who was able to refuel and 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser left no chance.
During the half-time Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak performance of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxony played now a little more courageously forward, but sparking ideas remained out until shortly before the end, when after all, the connection hit still succeeded.
The Hesse were much more efficient.
After an hour, Rebic started a solo and then laid across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was for the Frankfurters against overwhelmed guests only show running, also Jovic hit one minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter made it to a million audience at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two blows.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Heilig-Kreuz-Fest
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Heilig-Kreuz-Fest on 14 September or on Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then is a procession to the Holy Cross church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, who dates from the 30-year-old war and is said to have been shot at by a Swedish soldier, according to legend.
Blood flowed from the gunshot wound.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
This is not finished to this day, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the Cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
Despite the importance for the Geisinger parish, the divine service was poorly attended.
After the divine service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and with the final blessing, the church part of the Feast of the Cross ended.
For many years, the Catholic church choir then invites to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish home.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon the parish still offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the façade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage has been more accurately identified and the individual calls for tenders have been prepared in more concrete terms.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but it has also been more determined, what was only possible by the inspection by means of scaffolding.
The base plastering works have been completed, before the winter the natural stone work is to be started and it is still hoped to complete a good half of these works this year.
Inauguration: New dormitory in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new dormitory for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße "a very special house" is now handed over to his destiny - all present were in agreement at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residence of the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
In its concept, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer's building was put to the test for the residents with mobile phone cap: "The house had gone into years and no longer up-to-date in the equipment," explained Bader in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved on to tear the house down.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
The Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction works have remained within the planned framework - both in time and financially.
Jürgen Heinz, Managing Director of Lebenshilfe, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that let the inhabitants experience the freedom to move even without foreign help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of Schwaben district, also said: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its residents who need tools to be mobile."
The homeliness and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this position is a real lucky case, because it is no longer to be acquired in today's situation".
In total, the new dormitory on Münsterblickstraße offers space on almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three residential groups.
Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed by collective agreement.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, Deputy SPD Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unit.
We cannot be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to the "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It was unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than the people in West Germany, but received 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has presented South Korean President Moon Jae in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, about one year old, reached their recipient already on Thursday.
They thus passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to "facilitate the habitation" of the animals.
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North had announced the gift of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and to apply for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket engines.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this commemorative year, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, makes it quite different in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to the work in hand - this is the unofficial motto for the Great Coalition's working week beginning today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU last did not summon the "return to the work" mantra-like.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and work, but be that it is.
If the Federal Government is now ready to devote itself to its task again - to governing - it should not be deterred from doing so by debating terms.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually accomplish something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last weeks, may already be shown by Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the government parties come together for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early on; a lesson from all this dispute.
First of all, however, issues of conflict are again on the agenda with the diesel retrofits and the skilled workers' immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange premiums slightly, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation for technical retrofitting of older diesel.
While a rapprochement took place over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned legislation on immigration of skilled workers.
The SPD calls for a place of residence for rejected asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "track change" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will again be a dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not the same and the same has come together for GroKo, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
It's a good fight.
Without dispute, a society characterised by such diverse, sometimes contradictory, interests does not move forward.
In order to be constructive, however, quarrels must not be relegated to the question of being or not being for party tactical reasons.
It's still about politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD should argue - but always have in mind the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, that is why the People's Party must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the sights
Is the Minister of Labour violating the applicable law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" were their legists working on the social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
In Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) comes to amazement - it brings the matter now to Parliament via question.
She assumed "that the minister only expressed her enthusiasm for the use of her team and did not want to announce any violations of applicable service law in front of running cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to "acquit Hartinger from any suspicion".
Police tear up a street in search of women's corpses
Marxgrün - The police did not want to comment on this for a long time.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, excavations have been carried out on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
Preceding that the investigators had previously deployed an archeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with its guide in repeated use, was finally able to narrow down the relevant place to a few meters.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian conservation authority in the area of the said street.
For more than a year now, the prosecution and the Criminal Police Court have been working on the missing persons' case.
Time and again a cycle path was closed at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because investigators suspect that in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago Heike's body might have been buried here.
Colour powder and eggs: Riots in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be held for the first time.
But there are riots before that.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and police took place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked with paint powder by the supporters of independence, among other things, in order to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 police officers from the Police National and Guardia Civil units wanted to honor their colleagues who were in the polling stations last year in the referendum, which was classified as illegal.
The attempt to prevent citizens from voting had also led to violence at that time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the approximately 6000 separatists would then have tried by force to break through the police chain, and threw paint bags and eggs at the officials, among other things.
Six people had been arrested, 24 more had been slightly injured, it said, citing the authorities.
On Monday, for the first time, the Independence Referendum will be held.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to separate the prosperous region from Spain, the central government in Madrid put Catalonia under compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians have also gone abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement continue to be in custody.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the compulsory administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Aggregated perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split goalless
Red-White Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
==References====External links==*Official website
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion, the final light and the third last, they turned out to be a gathered perplexity.
The first half was very manageable by the entertainment factor.
Therefore, those who would rather get a beer or a sausage could do so without concern.
There was no danger of missing a chance, because there was practically no chance.
First shot after half an hour
Gütersloh's Nick Flock in the 28th minute was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire game.
The Ahleners had the best - and in principle only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty zone border.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel from 18 meters was aiming just above the housing and after one hour, the Gütersloher also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball conquest by Matthew Wieckowicz it was fixed.
The quickly performed counter over Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62.) with a lax shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a head ball by Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball by ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, initially bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Kappel (70th).
It did - nothing.
The Ahleners did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but they didn't bring anything.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero". But unfortunately the zero also stood at the front.
"This time we weren't as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede and that even though our opponent didn't want to play here," stated RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, "everything so bit" against a team "who just wanted to defend.
At any rate, I didn't feel we could get a back gate," says Daut.
However, to his regret, the audience did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfeld harvest market: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for which these donations are intended, are delighted.
Volunteers assure: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld as well".
At the opening, the sky was shining blue, but the space was still a little empty, but this should change during the day.
Because: "It's so nice and sociable here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
As always, the organiser of the Franz Josef Holthaus Festival welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit with a neat pinch of humour.
Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice for the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed against food.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there's plenty of Kreimers.
And the "replacement" couldn't take it, in between musically, to entertain the more and more growing visitors.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at a later hour.
"Just great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is happy about the many active people with their stands, among them mainly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a plaque," he thanked nevertheless for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivals that took place in September and the "Clean up" campaign.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful paint - here something goes.
Then the Maikranz was taken by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarters.
Many stalls worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty, everything was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative at his decapier saw.
He had veneer work, beer cover with Reckenfeld motifs and a lot more on offer.
Three Reckenfelder beekeepers offered a speciality: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought with them by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Neithershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The last one has another specialty.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that allowed the visitors to stay for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage programme that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrication with local political message: No successful advertising for skate facilities
In Lengerich, unknown people have been promoting the construction of a skate facility in a way that is hardly conducive to success.
According to Jürgen Kohne from the city administration, there are corresponding smearings in several places on request from the WN.
At least one case has been brought before the police for damage to property.
In large letters the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" were displayed on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt bistro had already been discovered after the professional election fair on 19 September.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an Edding at the time, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later this was again there, this time sprayed on," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
It is precisely this case that gets a special note by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also called on the board.
If the skate facility is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without mentioning names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been concerned with the subject of skate facilities.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the Council voted in favour of the majority in favour of the fire-fighting car park.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a building at this point.
A reversal followed at the end of June.
The members of the main and financial committee voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word then has the city council.
He expects a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Air traffic control congestion is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, the German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement next year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said Matthias Maas, head of the Air Traffic Control Union, the German Press Agency, before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
One important reason for the many delays and flight failures was the long-known shortage of personnel in European air traffic control services, for which there was no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots lasts four to five years," said the unionist.
Europe-wide, the market for fully trained pilots has been swept away.
Around a hundred people were missing in the Karlsruhe centre for surveillance of the upper German airspace alone.
Maas again criticized that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the federal, state, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic city on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work consolidation and overtime, it won't work without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German air traffic control system.
Maas again blamed the EU Commission for the Lossen Misere.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings in national air traffic control services are now fully in line with operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to campaign in Brussels for regulations that "do not tie the air even further down" air traffic controllers.
At present, the EU targets would be agreed by 2024 and further tightening would be feared.
The EU was exposed to constant lobby pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high delay costs for airlines would lead to a change of thinking.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offers a "consistent training and future pact", said Maas.
The so far announced admission of 120 pilot students each year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related departures.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favour of the plans for the restructuring of the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-ridden group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in staff beyond the already known administrative cuts.
After two resignations, the controlling body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50 percent stake in the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demonstrations of police officers and Catalan supporters of independence.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police officers and Catalan supporters of independence in Barcelona have resulted in violent clashes with numerous injured.
According to the city administration, some 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police had tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other with a large bid.
According to the forces, however, supporters of independence tried repeatedly to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and throwing bullets.
Rangeleien also existed, according to the information, between the participants of the various protest movements.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
The police reported that there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police had wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had campaigned against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government almost exactly one year ago.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil find it unjust that Catalan and Basque police officers earn much more than they do.
The protesters found it a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they beat us up a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who have only done their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is for enforcing our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
However, he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Breakdown allowed access to personal data British Minister
A vulnerability in a mobile app has caused the personal data of ministers and MPs of the Conservative British Tory Party to be temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known one day before Tory Party Day in Birmingham.

Two people died driving their car against a tree.
The car is currently on fire.

Football: Juve-Trainer praises after top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star-stormer had "played the best game this evening along with the half-hour of Valencia", Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri praised after the 3–1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively bought-in star was the decisive man in the important game against the chaser even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's good," Allegri said.
Even if we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we grew.
Thanks to the three goal templates of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early fall due to the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and suspended the worst chaser for the time being.
The goal hunter brought in by Real Madrid initially put on former Bundesliga pro Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26./49.).
And Ronaldo also did the preliminary work for the hit of defensive boss Leonardo Bonucci (76th) after a corner by headball, who only had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," the coach praised.
However, Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goal scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve goal scorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' power seems to be even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the previous seven years already has six points ahead of Naples.

But at the latest after the place reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top part was decided.
The Portuguese had to climb too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the place.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.
The German national player has prevailed at Juve.
==References====External links==*FIFA profile*FIFA profile
The midfield player also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the 2–0 victory of the Turiners and is closed for the home match on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly bizarre appearance, rapper Kanye West has attracted attention at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused the audience to frown and question marks.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From then on, let's just call him "Ye", according to the musician.
"The being formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince when he dropped his stage name.
The pseudonym, however, is not news.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had stated that "Ye" had a religious significance for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you," the rapper says.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Got it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was simply more gripping, we almost never put him before problems". Accordingly, the list of bullets in Hoetmar reads thinly.
Gradually two goal chances in 90 minutes, so only rarely games can be made positive.
Football district league A1: SC Hoetmar subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first run, but the first used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to the early lead (7.).
Steffen Uphus could have increased in the 43rd minute, but after great preliminary work by Krause he was free-standing.
The hosts had only a double opportunity when initially Moritz Höne failed to reach Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61st) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all forgave.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the goal line with his hand and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stabbed the ball over the line was the match decided (81.).
"We had criticized ourselves hard before, which was then different today than in the last weeks," concluded Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7th), 0:2 Berheide (81st).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think about that," he grumbled after words.
"We didn't get any access to them at all." He supposedly meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-whites who noticed with a collective offensive urge.
Nevertheless, he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he still said, winking cheekily and pulling from then on His players, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel of two teams, one of which plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class preservation.
With understandable mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"As we come back after the 0-2, as we hold against one of the league's top teams over the entire season, that was really phenomenal".
This makes it all the more bitter that one must now go home empty-handed.
Top goal hunter Lars Zymner brought the hosts with his 12th goal in the lead (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2–0 he laid over the left side exemplary for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take a player like that out completely.
"That was already madness, what he did," Lewandowski enviously acknowledged the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own eleven made the balance: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through the long goal (45th).
After the change of sides it was again McGill who scored the balance (59th).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nubel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann looked like (69th).
Despite the excess, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80th).
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74th/Albacht).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duel between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.

Media: All Bureau of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire presidium of football second league player Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
In the evening, several media called for a joint letter from the Saxony board.
At first there was no confirmation of the club.
The reason for the withdrawal is said to be internal power struggles with the former Bundesligist.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days, the Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many thought that he should not have been invited.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to personally collect the tolerance prize in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
This was how Academy Director Udo Hahn counted him when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors were already with us". However, the fact that celebrities repeatedly show up at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective.On 29 September, writer Frido Mann will attend a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: he wants to receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him personally in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it in themselves.
"The pension is not safe!" is written in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarism without a limit".
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death - the war taunts every humane idea".
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between the poor and the rich to the radical change in work through digitization.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced that "free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to seek solutions or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting on the 200th.
Karl Marx's birthday will soon be expected by more visitors to the direction of capitalism criticism, while the others are more likely to be "from the left to the centre".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Musikkabarett: Gender Understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret woman, Teubner took on gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat at the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes also speaks up to the end of the sentence, and on the other, a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies him so congenially harmoniously that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely, as it suited the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: Man's satisfaction comes when he has a partner but does not open the door.
On the other hand, a closed door without a partner would be of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: What would have emerged from Mozart's composing if "the Nannerl" had opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt full of blood and wounds" into the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's G minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the Chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck could not take any additional thanks.
She had the idea to treat the duo to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.

Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police corrected the number of victims slightly downwards.
Ten passengers were slightly injured instead of 15.
They were all released from the hospital by now.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night to observe.
He was released during the day, said a spokesman for the police.
The cause of the accident of the long-distance bus at Bruchsal is still unclear.
The long-distance bus crashed frontally against a guardrail on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women's Landesliga: Ahlener SG holds the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlener women had problems mainly with third-liga player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten hits.
"Actually I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many goals.
We didn't get a grip on them," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more upset about the many missed opportunities.
The concentration at the end made his team miss this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end a residue, lying behind at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45th).
Only towards the end did the wider bank of the hostesses make a decisive impression.
In addition, Aydogdu set back room Merle Klement on left side, which then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
At the second league downhill VC Allbau Essen, the blue and whites won 3–1.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the upper third of the league.
We have now worked this out," said coach Dominik Münch, looking forward to an almost impeccable performance of his team at the overthrown table leader.
The guests dominated the first passage almost at will.
About 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the vice-champion of the previous year at 25:15.
Essen accepted in the two-bar, but it didn't come into play.
We've kept her busy.
Our opponent has opened with high risk, but has also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen has switched the assumption to triple bars.
We couldn't hold the impact pressure.
Food sucked in, and we got a little lulled in," Münch continues.
At 18:17 the volleyball women from the Ruhr had their noses ahead for the first time.
Although Ostbevern was still defending four set balls in the 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," the instructor found to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silke contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV turned the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "That's where we played consistently and calmly".
About 7:3 and 15:13 brought the blue and white passage four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dirtmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the manner in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"The mosque opening in Cologne has left a pile of pieces in German-Turkish relations, which can only be tediously brought together," said Gökay Sofuoglu, chairman of the German editorial network.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of highlighting Muslims' belonging to Germany side by side with top German politicians, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu lamented.
The far-reaching exclusion of the German public had "reinforced many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break is finally Folktreff time again.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 19.30 o'clock the home club Nottuln already organizes its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost to the day exactly it is then a year ago that we carried out a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk meeting would be so fast in Nottuln.
Whether storm deep Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"As always, the program at the next Folktreff is a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites musicians who are always friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer and his accordion promised the first Folktreff "birthday".
For many years he was a member of Gaitling, a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with German lyrics.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The creators of the Folktreff are happy to remember the last event in the summer when Christoph Schulz from Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht" inspired the audience and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend once again a sociable and humorous evening," says the home club's invitation.
Anyone who plays an instrument and has the desire to actively contribute is invited to join in.
Since the sought - after seats are always occupied quickly, it is recommended to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking a further step on the way to becoming the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority approved the proposed merger, Linde informed on Sunday.
As a result, the multi-billion-dollar merger still faces the approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the US.
Most recently, according to an insider, the chances of an agreement had improved there because Linde promised to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit farming to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall, the 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and regional care was celebrated.
On 29 September 1893, the last foundation impulses for the Kulmbach Association for Horticulture and Regional Care Kulmbach were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday evening, he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
At that time, however, he was called "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (Kulmbach Town and Land District Building Association) and was christened in 1893 by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was different from today's work - it was actually about fruit-growing, about flowers and horticulture nobody thought back then.
"At that time, in the era of Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favourite child of the elites," explained Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his keynote speech.
Fruit trees were to line highways, so-called industrial gardens were built in schools.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But this does not mean that the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological crop protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role, as do the conveying of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwerfen" showed entertainingly on stage how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said county chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can gather a lot of joy with Smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"The Kreisverband decides where they should stand," added Landrat Söllner, stressing the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The county association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county also left no doubt about the fact that district managing director and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the Kreisverband with a picture lecture and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
Everything used to come out of the garden, it was ingested for the winter.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the commercial garden turned into a decorative and residential garden.
"Nature exists, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," the expert pleaded for fruit and nut trees.
That is why the horticultural associations are encouraged not to let up, so that our home remains beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian State Association.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif, who was solemnly framed by the tower winders of the Thurnau music club.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada's foreign minister transfers UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: they provide both trading partners with an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Due to time pressure in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister would not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, her spokesman, Adam Austen, announced.
Meanwhile, she focuses on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Secretary of Economy Ildefonso Guajardo stated on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the United States.
The US and Mexico agreed on a recast of the Nafta regional free trade agreement in August.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
They are to be concluded by Sunday evening (local time), and Trump's government intends to present the agreement to the U.S. Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-designate Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
According to a report from the daily newspaper "O Globo", the far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances last week before the presidential elections in the South American country.
The politician had been attacked on the street at the beginning of September during an election campaign event in South Brazil.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people took to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht") women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations mobilised Bolsonaro's racist and misogynistic statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally of the Brazilian Workers Party (PT) presidential candidate Fernando Haddad.
He replaced ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As ex-mayor of the city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump Brazils" has long been involved in politics, but is now presenting itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reaches the absolute majority in the first round, there will be a runoff election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this successful - no matter who he competes against.
Bolsonaro is known to incite homosexuals and blacks and glorify the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula's leftist workers' party should be shot.
Europe takes back Ryder Cup titles
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour away from Disneyland, the European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale at the gates of Paris.
The outsider team of Captain Thomas Björn dethroned the favourite defending champion USA for a toothless Tiger Woods in front of more than 150,000 spectators on the three days in the Le Golf National with great punches and outstanding team spirit.
After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer had died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen reported on Larsen's website.
On the deathbed Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become familiar with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band's dissolution in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday in a statement as a "street boy" who was "against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared on the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rocknacht in der Schuhfabrik: Volume at press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger". Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock from three other bands.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no sign of stage fright.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - inspire with their bands loudly the about 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night visibly.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the beginning of the concert evening with newest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage is danced during the performance to the harmonious and powerful interaction of the band.
Although "Zugabe" calls cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
That hard rock is not the same as hard rock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the yearning, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" captivates by the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuchen has gained a special reputation since its founding in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with her performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China from 2017 - is obvious and unsurpassable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also sets his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
At the same time, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a cheered solo while walking through the audience.
A certain volume is of course part of such a hard rock concert: According to the Mischpult team, the "Mint Mosquito" rock night is about 98 decibels at the three-piece concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition".
This is, for example, on press air hammer level, but is thus still clearly below the outputs of the "wacken fesitval", indicating the "Ignition" on their website.
Ear deafening 120 decibels in jet drive volume as usual in the north of the republic, however, the Ahlen audience does not need on this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky Gangart have long been convincing with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, took the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger", all three groups, of course in the figurative sense, can say at the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead man in a glider accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim/Essen airport.
A glider crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near Mülheim/Essen Airport.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider had crashed at the fair parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is said to be a one-seater.
The plane had already arrived at the time of the accident.
The crash site is only a short distance from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But an Oktoberfest has been taking place since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the border of the two Ruhr district cities and directly on the driveway to the highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at major events at the Essen Fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that the US President North Korea's leader Kim is quite well-behaved despite the nuclear crisis.
But now Trump has made a genuine declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's beautiful letters.
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has committed himself to a new flame.
The Tragic: It's a long-distance relationship.
In public Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia Trump found almost tender words for the half-old offspring of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although it proves to be quite tough in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, so was he, and between us it went back and forth," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Her personal connection had also borne political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even if critics see little more than lip service behind it.
The U.S. president seemed quite aware that the affection for the notorious "Rocket Man" - according to Trump's nickname for Kim - should not be common to everyone.
In any case, he took the anticipated criticism of his appearance in a large sports hall in Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they've fallen in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
It's so impresidial.
But he cares very little about it, explained Trump, and then pointed his index finger at the crowd: "I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidential."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this bulging arena, but we would only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visited, atmospheric and also spoiled by sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfestflair, Baesweiler's city center cleaned out on Sunday.

Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya with the help of a mobile phone video, thus enabling them to be rescued.
The group had shot the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under life risk and distributed it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, the AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya while trying to get to Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he put himself in danger of death, according to his own statement.
One of his comrades had been beaten almost to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the detention conditions were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year with the help of the programme, said IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians who have now been rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
However, he had not heard of a call for help via mobile video.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her classes for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
Around 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building across the main entrance.
In the front of the first floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher told the police who started the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot be said yet.
Description of perpetrator: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark trousers, dark T-shirt.
Information please to the Obernberg Police Inspectorate at the Inn, phone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in Central Franconia after he had stuck the car off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue personnel accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and released the missing person since Tuesday evening, the police reported on Sunday.
According to the data, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said to look forward to his home now.
The retiree had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride with his off-road vehicle across the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search measures, the whereabouts of the man had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey in conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own statements.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at the Cologne airport.
This concerns above all the waves of arrest, the freedom of the press and religion.
He therefore made it clear at Erdogan that "if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite".
According to Laschet, the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey were also mentioned.
He had put forward the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defense at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued to travel after the conversation to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their point of contact - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of stressing the success of North Korea's denuclearization negotiations, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington's concessions.
North Korea's Secretary of State Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula in the UN general debate with its ongoing sanctions.
"The recent stalemate comes from the US relying on coercive measures that are deadly to build confidence," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean Chief Diplomat.
That punishment measures could force North Korea on the "knee" was "a dream of people who do not know us".
In order to build confidence, however, his country had stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri emphasized.
However, there had been no "appropriate reactions" from the US side, the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council had adopted sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been urging the United Nations to strictly comply with the sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump had met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang for talks on ending the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting place, of which the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing: White blankets and flower decoration on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the harvest thanksgiving service.
The youths of the HoT had conjured the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new cuisine.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break the bad surprise came: a power failure had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of service, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," says Westbuer.
And so everyone took part.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"Cooks can't do better either," one visitor praised, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," stressed Father Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen with card tricks and other tricks made for amazement.
Jürgen Sator leaves the Land Executive Committee NRW of the Tafel
Out of frustration about criticism from the own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has resigned his post in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice-chief of the NRW-Tafeln, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
Too many fell in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the Land Association of Tables NRW, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy to the dpa.
The sharp criticism was taken away by Sartor.
"I can understand his step - there were people who didn't know exactly why the Essener Tafel did it".
But Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticized criticism of colleagues from other boards in the "world on Sunday".
One should not follow the approach, "without us the people in the city starve".
It is the task of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not attend a congress of the blackboards on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm told too much sweet stuff," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis who criticized me so much at the time.
SF Lorch play 2:0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, district league Lorch loses to Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after lagging behind - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
At 2-0, Lorch was already in the lead in the home match against the TV Neuler - at the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
The TV Heuchlingen is quite different: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind with 0–1, but after 90 minutes it won with 2:1. Meanwhile, at the top of the table, the SGB was able to score a 3–0.
Gladbach playful double lead - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait for an away victory in Wolfsburg.
In the 2:2 the foals play twice a lead.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first win of the season (1:0).
(sda) Four times in the first five league matches, Schalke has maneuvered into the asides with early goals.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again showed the strength with which it had finished first in the last season behind the Bayern.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home equipe in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Evgeni Konopljanka by head, in the following the hosts conserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund once again hails from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had negotiated a 0–2 reserve against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came to the 4–2 victory in the 2nd half-time.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) matched four minutes with a doublette, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break with another doublette in the final phase (86th/94).
The VfB Stuttgart also won its first victory.
Against Werder Bremen, who had already been decimated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, the Stuttgarters had to fear in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler manufactured a curious insertion-owner, which helped the guests in the 68th minute to compensate.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also no failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
Gladbacher, who competed with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave a lead twice, played 2:2 and have been waiting for an away win in VW City since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's equalization to the 1:1 with his second Federal Ligator.
Yann Sommer was powerless at the flat shot from 20 metres of the Aargauer, as was the second hit after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa turns out to be a goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase made by OGC Nice hit for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh mandatory match.
After seven laps, Gladbach finished 4th.
Within 40 minutes, the previously undefeated Werder Bremen against the VfB Stuttgart maneuvered into an uncomfortable situation.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first season hit.After 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: The 23-year-old Serb collected yellow-red after a jersey pluck against Daniel Didavi.
Although Stuttgart's defenders Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back into the game through a curious throw-in goal (68th), Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters back to the Siegesstrasse a quarter of an hour before the end.
Nuremberg ruled the duel against Düsseldorf 3-0 sovereignly for itself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already put the home team on course by means of foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million citizens are voting today on whether the name of their country should be changed in northern Macedonia.
If yes, the nearly three decades smouldering conflict with neighbour Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and had blocked any rapprochement of Macedonia with the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future of Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member in the event of a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrians in U-Haft.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three retirees and thereby injured them partly severely.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted on Friday at around 10 p.m. in the escape street in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who started with clenched fists on passers-by and tried to attack them, about his behavior.
Then the Syrian tried to beat and kick the officials.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had struck three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists on Währinger Straße at a tram stop shortly before.
He had also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for a still unknown cause", as the police said.
He was taken to hospital and continuously monitored during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the yes word on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously told the "picture" newspaper that a registered partnership was not in question for them.
"If we get married, it's right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir on 30 June 2017 with a rage speech.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"That was your Shabowski moment," he said in allusion to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meter hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Bürgervereinigung Kinderhaus and the Gesellschaft für Leprakunde.
Because around 400 meters hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce costs," explained the chairman of the citizens' association Walter Schröer.
And there was a lot of stuff accumulating too.
Because of the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a shape cut.
Because already in spring the hedge had been shaved before.
The breakfast always following the work has also had a long tradition.
"We want everyone to stay up to speed," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner gets gold at the World Canoe slalom Championships
Hannes Aigner from Augsburg won the gold medal at the conclusion of the World Canoe slalom Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had already enough trips here on the grounds and it all fit today," said the Olympic third of London 2012.
At the finish, he threw his paddle away with joy and raised both arms victoriously - knowing well that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had takeoff number four.
However, the six remaining starters could not top his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
Second became the Czech Jiri Prskavec before the Russian Pavel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempt to break into a single-family home this fall.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - this is what burglars want to use again.
Thus, the police inspector Gauting reported yesterday the first attempt to break into this autumn.
The fact that it remained in the attempt at the single family house on Königswieser Straße is due to the alarm system.
It started on Friday, just before 8 p.m., when the perpetrators started their hand.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised them so much that they took the run without loot.
Notes to PI Gauting, phone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Broke at Hertha: caught up with reality: Bavaria challenged against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: FC Bayern "does not want to let itself be pleased" with the defeat in Berlin.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the tenure of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance dell under the new coach Niko Kovac is not meant to increase to a larger autumn low for the Munichers.
"One week ago, the impression was that we were invincible.
Now the reality has caught up with us a bit," Thomas Müller noted after the earned 0–2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a response for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
If you know us, you know that this really upsets us and that's why we're gasping towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year no goal has been scored abroad, as at the same time of the preseason two compulsory games in series without victory, the table lead in the football Bundesliga for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
The overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running-intensive man-against-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle-stitches over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last seeming overpowering Bavaria should be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we won't let this happen and we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again," Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, however, he handled his losers surprisingly gently in his native city and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the once again deficient handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim conclusion of his term positive - otherwise the tone is likely to intensify.
For example, Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second King-class appearance of this season after the 2–0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the brief preparation for the second pre-round match against Ajax begins as planned, which had also conquered AEK Athens sovereignly with 3–0 at the start.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place Joshua Kimmich spoke clear text.
The right defender appeared in the role as Mahner.
"I don't think that's all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes in the back," the 23-year-old stressed shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bayern were already behind Dortmund with five points, which now took the lead again with a point advantage.
And so Kimmich, with a wink, rated at least positive that the public debate about supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack from Erdogan to Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the union line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for sovereignty of interpretation in the permanent issue of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association line.
On early Sunday morning, Grindel, personally attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the causa in Mainz's ZDF "Sportsstudio".
"In the future, because we also have many players with a migrant background in the U-teams, we have to draw very precise conclusions that this does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migrant background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel again stated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had strongly denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they had my photograph taken in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in the cathedral city.
To be honest, as their president, I couldn't stand the fact that our two young men who have risen to the German national team have been marginalized.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that unlike Özil after the World Cup affair, which had begun with Erdogan's photos, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB".
At the same time, he announced that he would want to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm a German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - I can't.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, that's what I've always said.
However, he does not see a basis for a return to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration officer will now be appointed alongside the Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says, "The issue is important, we have to take care of it", this would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs where integration must work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he intends to run again for office as DFB President next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - According to the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Friday.
Initially, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic lights in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he was driving against her car.
However, there was no exchange of personal details, as the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone report about a motorist who had gotten off the road and driven against a lead post.
When asked, the man did not want a police force on the spot and then drove away.
Then the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has been moving in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and has rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Eventually, the police could find him and stop him.
His car had significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made an impression and couldn't remember much.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 volunteers are still in operation.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the bog fire on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 volunteers are still busy with the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop in a stable manner, according to a spokesperson, 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of forces is planned, it is said.
On the night of Sunday, an aboveground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week the disaster had been lifted, which was proclaimed well a week earlier on 21 September, because it had been feared that the flames would put adjacent forests and settlements in danger by wind and spark flight.
Thursday then it was said that an attack of the fire on neighboring communities would no longer threaten.
At times, more than 1500 forces tried to control the major fire on site.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones from the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned for 2 and 5 October.
The fire had been triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the bog fire had temporarily moved up to a hundred kilometres far over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point to receive claims reports.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the yes word on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously told the "picture" newspaper that a registered partnership was not in question for them.
If we're getting married, it's right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir on 30 June 2017 with a rage speech.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"That was your Shabowski moment," he said in allusion to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in adoption law.
Referendum started in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its northern province of the same name, neighbouring Greece.
As a means of exerting pressure, Athens had blocked any approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they also give the start for their country's western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from oblivion
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner of 1986 dies in the USA in 2016 and leaves behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be removed with explicit consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stress situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
If necessary, your wishes can then be called up by Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs - as in Germany - can only be removed with explicit consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
According to Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation, 15 percent of Swiss people are expected to have a donor card.
But only in five percent of cases a card is found at the crucial moment in possible donors.
In over 60 percent of the conversations, the family members do not know the desire of the deceased.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Always.
A similar registration system is already in place in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesperson of the Federal Agency for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - per or counter organ donation -," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has advocated a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered an organ donor, unless he or she disagreed.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is the world champion in mental arithmetic
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in mental arithmetic.
He prevailed at the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 fellow fighters.
Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, shared this on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany finished third.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old retired from France, as chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The professor of computer science from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks included: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon in which participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüss from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings were already two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
Organiser Laue can hardly begin with terms such as superbrain, genius or prodigy.
"Head arithmetic can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadia-oriented computational competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, the drawing of the square root from six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, the candidates get surprising tasks for which they have to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here the Germans also had good chances, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage, because early in childhood, head arithmetic is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Intrusive appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis Ace Serena Williams shows herself from her sensitive and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer and fight for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings up without the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate spots.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of this.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams would have died almost a year ago.
There were complications at the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans to significantly extend the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill on the so-called "Symbols Act" in review.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shakes her beds out for the first time in the West next week: Polare Kaltluft reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 metres at the beginning of the week - it was said that it could snow down to about 1,000 metres in narrow valleys at a strong intensity.
From Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimeters of fresh snow is to be expected above 2,000 meters.
On higher Passstraßen (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße), the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start the annual kinking on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start their annual kink care on Monday.
The "green ramparts" unique in Germany have shaped the landscape of the low-forest state for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide tree and shrub hedges are "forest replacements" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect scattered habitats as corridors, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the Nature Conservation Association Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of an order from the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, which ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundary and livestock fences, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also dates back to that time: The dense, intertwined boundaries could develop by "turning" the branches.
Today, some 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North and Baltic Seas and give the image of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used by some 7000 species as a substitute habitat.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometer of kink and breed up to 30 bird pairs.
However, the Knick can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise, he is stunted to a light tree row, which in addition to biodiversity also loses wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, kink care may only be carried out outside the breeding period from October to March.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about local situation
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami yourself?
No, I was in Jakarta at the time on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have run on surrounding hills where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are staying in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people steal some food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners run around partially free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still a lot of bodies around, many people have not been found and are missing.
How is communication and information provision on the island?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but before that it didn't work and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors, and other people who do not know if they live and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but, for example, at work.
The tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hits the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi lying on the Pacific ring of fire not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must for a long time renounce Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss the VfB Stuttgart with serious muscle injuries for a long time.
On Saturday, Aogo pulled a muscle fibre crack in the back left thigh in the 2–1 against Werder Bremen, the football Bundesliga player announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle fracture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably still miss games after the following international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not provide a forecast of downtime.
A muscle fracture usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fracture usually heals slightly faster.
Triumph of hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The San Sebastián Film Festival closes the most prestigious European festivals every year.
Despite all the singing on the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of his best competitions of recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching fire department tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the action lasted for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - walkers at Lake Olching noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was staying in the area of the water guard station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire department.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the forces over and over again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade could circle the animal and push it back ashore, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a hearty grip.
The duck injured on the chest was then taken to the LMU animal clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But, according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard aims at World Cup medal
In the fourth place at Olympia, biathlete Julian Eberhard was long in his stomach.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to catch up on the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the close to grasping medal.
In the end, seven tenths of a second were missing on bronze.
"I deliberately took the time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up with the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to a major event with the Constitution, to win something.
You'll have to hit it someday.
The World Cup track in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I've already taken the track into my heart," he remembers with joy his fourth World Cup place in the single race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the season, he ran in Oslo (NOR) in second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in turbotempo
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is severely limited.
With a turbo-tempo FBI investigation, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate are seeking to secure the breath-thin majority for the judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial over allegations of coercion.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents that have occurred more than 30 years ago.
The most recent turning point in the drama about Kavanaugh's appointment, accompanied by a cultural struggle, had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first accuser Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the lawyer ran angry Tirades against the oppositional Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake stated, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had still called the heavy preliminaries on Thursday "Beschiss", initially abstained from further attacks against the women and on the contrary spoke of "luck in misfortune".
In this way, final doubts could be removed, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats sharply in an election rally because they reject Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy".
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
Also, the White House has extremely limited investigator powers.
One would specifically investigate the known accusations of two women, no more, a government representative told the "Wall Street Journal": "They are not going on a fishing trip".
According to The New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried for monitoring the speed limit will be stationed on Gartenstraße from Monday, 1 October.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: The fear was felt
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home match against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room," said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the royal blues managed to bring the close 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first win of the season under control.
In fact, things could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11th to the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given security Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playfully and from pressing"., with increasing playing time obviously more and more the head played a role.
Don't really make a headball monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore kept retreating.
And defend with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"All of us have fallen from the heart of a huge stone," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball shot: "I'm actually the worst headball player in the man's creation."
But in the end, the only thing that counts is victory.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the initial phase with a lot of pressure and make fireworks from it," said Schalke's head coach.
Victory was important.
Finally we can enjoy a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest drawback of the afternoon: royal blue missed it, rather for clearer conditions to worry.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have become a trembling victory," Tedesco said: "You've already felt the fear a little bit."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only shawl with that.
Fischbachau: smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From around two kilometres away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire on Sunday around 1.30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause was soon found out by the police and the fire department: an unknown person had set fire to garbage on a two-square-meter surface at Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it seemed that he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the flame unattended.
And that's near the forest.
30 Fischbachauer firefighters were busy pulling out and deleting.
The police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my job to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the "Cultural Policy" alliance in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very casually, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic intelligibly.
With a lot of gestures, tangible numbers and one or the other joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflict-laden topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts growing despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at one table, first-generation migrants at the Katzentisch.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to come to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflict.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether one is politically right-wing or left-wing, but: "Am I for or against an open society?", he emphasizes.
At first rather restrained, then more and more lively the discussion round starts.
And there's a need to talk.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or not successful integration with students.
El-Mafaalani is standing in front, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: she is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not urge his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "only if we understand what the problem is, can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing session, he also had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities, was intensively discussed further.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win opening games
The Giessen 46ers and Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first match day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away win.
Gießen prevailed in a hard-fought match in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won 86:79 (49:47) at the BG Göttingen.
The first league leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 Gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champions Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich already struggled on Friday to an 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80 on Saturday.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 properties
The demand is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the properties in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots in the new Landsham-Süd area on the free market.
That's what Mayor Roland Frick says.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 plots offered by the municipality at more favourable conditions or prices, similar to the former local model, has been completed.
A good 100 applications were received, says Frick.
"Currently the documents are checked", regarding the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Pliening, the aim is to have the candidate ranking for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to present them to the municipal council.
The award could then be made.
A total of 50 plots for single and double houses are being created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family houses with an estimated eight housing units each.
The development is now almost complete and the roads and roads are to be paved soon.
A single plot as well as two of the apartment houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in the socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multifamily houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented dwellings funded by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated is the area of the new Landsham-South housing area created for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start is there for the new building of a day care centre.
It will accommodate three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
Thus Schalkes Naldo "big sport" succeeds also on the bench
For the third time in a row not in the starting team: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had sat not in the Schalker starting team for the third time in a row, but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great among many people, if the almost two-meter-sized Brazilian had really talked about the frustration of the soul.
But as the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle as usual after the 1–0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco to all his pros, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Naldo for the sake of simplicity, intervened and said, "We have to thank coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reservist existence, did not harbor any resentment.
Probablely, Naldo knows, who was celebrated last season as the best Schalker, that he did not really fall on the siding with his coach - but for good reasons he gets a break.
A reason called "load control."
It wasn't easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you quite honestly," Tedesco reported from the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the starting team.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedesco explained the step.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can take a breath right now.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which last also caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving to be an exemplary team player on the bank.
The mood in Austria's industry continued to accelerate in August compared to the eurozone.
The purchasing manager index (PMI) was at a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
Nevertheless, Austria still has the third-best mood in Europe, behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute reported on Monday on its survey among 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, which means that the index is still below the 50-point mark for the 13th consecutive month, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked this threshold with 50.9 points in August.
The final result was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index peaked at 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened descent could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, industry remains the number one growth brake in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell as strongly as since November 2011.
The companies therefore removed jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also declined more strongly in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing manager index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in turnover, employment, stocks and prices are being raised.
Tuchel's PSG team succeeds in winning eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel rushes with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship further from victory to victory.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won 3–0 (1–0) thanks to two hits from Superstar Neymar and was thus also successful in the eighth league match.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and produced the final score in the postseason.
Christopher Nkunku (46th) took care of the 2-0 in the meantime.
Thus Paris also managed the dress rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the class, Tuchel's team had to accept the only mandatory defeat this season at the 2:3 in Liverpool.
