The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm #PRS_ORG# Grand customer and so it's no problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should add to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way of crediting?
I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a quick look, help a short time, bring the bottle etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for a short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
It's the best way to see if this fits your kids.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and go to sleep for hours.
Legally, it's probably questionable.
Maybe that's why the psychologist's statement comes.
Because if something actually happened like a fire, burglary, earthquakes, alien invasion etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a thriller/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole plot, but I don't want to think of the title partout anymore maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and therapy.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by pouring food on himself and going to his predatory cats in the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, gets to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The Commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is commissioned anonymously to go and document the place of the suicide before each suicide and to place the photos in the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where a chip is transplanted to the patient that suppresses a fear center in the brain and ultimately places the patients in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out of the window another drives to death intentionally)
This facing fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
In the end, there's a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That's the rough plot I'm quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author/author.
If this story is known to anyone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh, dear, I don't have the password for the Wlan.
I have to contact my husband first.
That may take a while.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has over the entire length wood chips under the thumb nail (outside).
Tried to pull him with a tweezer.
Very hard to grasp.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
We're going to the doctor tomorrow.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Thanks to the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we reach dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotive of track gauges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It controls the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders register fully automatically at a suitable digital centre.
It controls all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read out on the main track with suitable central panels.
For centers that can program only the CVs of 1-255 exist auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed steps at 255 addresses.
Three other Motorola® addresses enable 16 functions to be triggered.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic login to mfx®-compatible controllers.
The LokSound 5 decoder detects the Märklin® brake tracks as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake components or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops at a Selectrix® brake diode.
An automatic ABC shuttle train allows automatic commuting between two stations.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to promote booster vaccination
New Omikron cases are always getting politics and science in the UK.
All qualifying adults in England should therefore receive a vaccination offer by the New Year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move forward even faster with the Corona booster vaccinations in view of rapidly increasing Omikron numbers than he has been aiming for so far.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson told his compatriots in a pre-recorded video message on Sunday night.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK Government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in the areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, people are facing an emergency, which is why vaccination protection needs to be strengthened urgently, Johnson said.
The good news was that the level of protection could be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
"Now let yourselves be boosted!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was a full 65 percent increase. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I'm in favour of everyone imagining pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today came the invitation to a conversation by e-mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but rather a somewhat more complicated name.
I Googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone help me, please?
** I am a foreigner and do not want to step over the feet of an official.
Conclusion: Everyone should imagine with pronouns.
Got a total of five books on it.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today won't work
Obviously, the chair had an undetectable lack of sales.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise ?
Only tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
==References====External links==
14 days no more.
So I always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but I wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge me this.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content Warning: I'm going to write something detailed about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about my soul.
I (21) come into contact more frequently with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens much too often is that many victims can't be helped or think we can't help them.
I am quite aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of tearing the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, are all worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never gets any easier.
Please, always remember, you're worth living without violence, that's so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What good is the series for "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, many complicated names, a stunning look: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two season?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debut of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least Youngster Johannes Patrick was dependable.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Prior to the match, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said to Hakro Merlins Crailsheim at the beginning of October: "We still have some anger in our stomach".
After the match, however, they did not settle - but increased again in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
But even more so than the naked result disappointed the way of the performance.
On the other hand, there is a statistic that expresses the whole dilemma: the three-way ratio was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) at 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer was given by John Patrick: "We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife, and did not implement what we trained".
Namely moving the ball.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim responded quite differently: "A great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the lucky coach.
"It felt like before 10,000 people".
Only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL-Topscorer T.J. Shorts, which marked 22 points and steered the game of his team.
"The best playmaker I've ever trained," Gleim still praised.
While in Patrick's team itself, performance performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed all along the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already been back 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to quarrel.
Already on Wednesday (19h) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I called in a couple of months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have re-informed ourselves legally and have therefore written them again.
We originally called in half a year ago.
Always spelled out of the egg: Max Raabe gets 59
He can inspire his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
At the moment he is on the road with the program "Good day, good luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it won't happen.
The planned concert was moved to May 2022 - "on official instruction" to contain the corona virus.
Other of his performances planned in the Advent period must also fail, as it is called on the singer's website, which is now 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to catch up on their appointments already set in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot and liked to sing as a teenager.
In Berlin he studied operatic singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself in the style of the comedian harmonists with its repertoire of percussion and chansons.
He has received many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place on the charts - just like his successful album "For women is not a problem" (2013).
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair combed back strictly and considered on etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer to be forgotten from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, good luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Minister for Building, Klara Geywitz (SPD), spoke out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation, there is not a single new apartment, only the ownership structure changes," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to assure tenants that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
A colourful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is by the way the best protection against a monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Green Party and the Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz did not rule out discussions with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent-price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the extension of the rent mirror.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.

At least 100 dead by tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have moved through the US.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
During the night of Saturday, several tornadoes in the United States have caused serious devastation and may have caused up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave behind an approximately 320-kilometre-long track of devastation, especially in the Kentucky state.
His governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado had run through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the Kentucky state alone, the official figures rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw her display case #NAME# sold out.
That's a shame.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely taken from the range?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
How long before you get in touch?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order !
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an artike or given up a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if this was received or processed, as I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising claims
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and offer their employees money bonuses for vaccination.
Thus, they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - according to the German model - is also intended to increase the readiness for Corona vaccinations.
He's changed to a company he's been blaspheming about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't get stuck in his old place, and he was looking for something else.
You can, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There's too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I'm doing a screen shot.

Help with first own campaign
Boron to greet!
For a group of 4 friends, I'm leading the Adventure About the Greifenpass and want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the bad guys and their motivations are written, the individual files are made up and now I am about to write the entry-level adventure and stumble over my own feet already at the first Encounter.
The premiere is that the heroes are supposed to bring a cartage with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There the further action is to develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of Goblins is supposed to ambush the hero and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early, whatever the players think of.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
If you don't notice, the Goblins lie in wait for the hero in a hollow path, flanking each three left and right with bows arming the cart, while two with spears stop the cart.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are subject, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village school, a half-elf.
The cart's gone, of course.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-elf with two of his servants intervenes and comes to the rescue of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you consider Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much to start the adventure?
The group Goblins will later play a decisive role, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will certainly take many of your ideas into consideration and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I put the lamp apart again.
And put it back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd still like to send her back
If you can then let the return notes come, then I can pack the lamp and take it to #PRS_ORG#.

Here the lower part was damaged, so almost the part with storage space.
Is everything then picked up again or only the storage space part?
I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get some air with this post.
First of all, today in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was aborted in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the schedule was far behind schedule due to the delayed start and the start accident, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons the F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has finished the race.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then in the F1 the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher again had no rules, so both didn't know that you can change tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that ramblings were allowed to change tyres when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton on this subject.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there was this possibility for rambling.
I think you should simply know such basic rules when you comment on the F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or prescribed by the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
Generally, Roos does not like the artificial comment style, but admit that the taste is a matter of taste.
But I really like Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant silliness, both of which simply make them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (so unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter, in particular, brings a great deal of unrest into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-out round Sky is the only station that goes into advertising, as one can listen to at F1TV since only the German sound track without comment has to get along immediately after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do.
Also, these two stations in the trainings do less advertising than Sky, and that as free TV stations.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The remaining program of Sky Sport F1 is also very meager and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster to broadcast the F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job in the four races, which they are still allowed to broadcast, except for advertising.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
To the here: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and that is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The First Lady told me it was going to be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she was going to check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them already showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for your support.
Fan pumps are excellent to supply an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
There you can see the benefits in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire systems with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable, so that you can connect more outflows.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump, it is also possible to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find it in our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or the like.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated design and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an airflow or the like... and it can start already.
The fan pump should be the same, or higher, as the water level and should be installed outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, you should put a check valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent once water would run backwards, the water running out of the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time here in ebay with 3 days, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up here every day.
Everything's going well on the way, it's going very fast.
We just want to prevent a little bit so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be, not everyone understands all the employees who also work in the forwarding sector...of course, no Corona stops here.
Please do not judge equally badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course, you like to scold at these services, even if we say at the moment...they've got it damn hard
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you order your legs here in light?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and host into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have made a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The launch and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under bright blue skies, Bezos personally received the newly-chosen astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue space suit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
With the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometres.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), for whom the Blue Origin missile system is named, and 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not tell them how much they paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard in his assignments and do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed enthusiasm.
He would like to return to space, said the presenter.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometres
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometres above Earth, at times with zero gravity, before the reusable object disengaged from large parachutes landed again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometres above Earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-flight of Blue Origin: the first time in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board himself, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
On October 2, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", also featured former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing forward the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting and also in the laboratory I am not bothered (I already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I also thought about career prospects before studying, but also at the time that I would like to study and become a doctoral student.
At the moment, however, doubts come to me, particularly distressing are the job prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you hear always super career opportunities and the profession is totally wanted, on the other hand you hear again and again from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I'd really like to know:
1) What are you working as right now?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/content?
3) What did you study / What training did you do?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really insecure right now, and in 2022 I'm thinking about maybe canceling my studies and making an apprenticeship as a specialist computer scientist.
If you have any experience there write it also likes times :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's only now that you have a post.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
It seems there are also before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Assumption" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So there was a long 4-day weekend in the house last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Loud e-mails, which had to get out before the driveway, order here order there, everything *required* before the long weekend.
Because... because?
Because "next week" sounds like so much time and shouldn't be?
Or because people want to do as much in a shorter week as they do in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday then, but I was also severely annoyed.
What's this self-aggression about holidays?
Then why do we still have holidays if we are not allowed to treat ourselves properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all so self-sufficient.
My question is simple: are we just like this, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld looks forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no gifts yet.
"The beauty, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will join the feast by baking cookies with her son and making them.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
But until the contemplative days she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I have to get started now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth operation of the mouse and the new plumage formation.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage occurring in bird keeping is due exclusively to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Much of the animal losses that occur during the mouse are due to a lack of or imbalance in protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered during use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
DDR-Handarbeitmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in operation in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railwayer ME Issue 11/1968, used with playing tracks and faulty parts see photos, function good, The series E 95 is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we have been reworked operationally
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to carry 2,200 tons of coal trains and 530 tons of passenger trains at 45 km/h cruising speed on this line.
The top speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined via the delivery as 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatz bearing drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and afterwards found themselves in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as reparation goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The reprocessing capability of all six locomotives was established in the Dessau Reichsbahnvermögerungswerk.
[4] As a result of the increasing re-electrification of the Central German network, there was an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy goods train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were reworked in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are available in larger quantities, were preferably built up.
It was only when the E 94 was expected that the number of reprocessing could not be further increased that the E 95 became the focus of the reprocessing.
[4]First, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They came to the railway depot Halle P. in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic with increasing age.
So it happened several times that Schütze remained stuck in switching actions.
Then the Beimann with hammer and wooden wedge, who was constantly riding on this locomotive, had to solve the shooter during the journey.
Damages to the engines were frequent and led to months of failures in the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new-build locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of the electrical operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn could forego old locomotives and most of the splinter categories, so that the E 95 was decommissioned.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy only one-man electric locomotives, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility of the cab.
[5] After the end of the E 95 02 and E 95 03 in mid 1969, they were the last to receive the E 95 01, which resigned from service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was therefore never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system on the main station of Halle.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive's first external rework began with the aim of presenting it to a vehicle show at RAW Dessau.
[5] It has since belonged to the Transport Museum Dresden as a museum locomotive that is not operational.
The locomotive was completed in 1986.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive is managed museal.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional association Bw Halle P have been working on the operational reprocessing of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time for an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paintwork, with the transformers being checked and five traction motors operational.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian mountain railway and the branching out secondary lines, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance expenditure.
In February 1945, the machines were transferred to Leipzig to become the Mitteldeutsche Netz.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, function good, it is necessary optical rework on the locomotive in own work, dusted, with traces of play, cellar smell !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are the
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held by two feet.Unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The centre beam does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I'll get some new ones.
When will they be sent out?
No, no, no, no, no.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right of the shape, they were only too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
As a matter of priority, they fulfil their purpose
They're not flat with me
Could I have these sent to you?
Hello #NAME#, do you want me to explain the problem again?
House fire with two slightly injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage occurred in the six-digit euro area, as reported by the police on Sunday.
The fire had spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents reportedly were taken to the hospital on Sunday with slight smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not assume intentional fire.
Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But then it arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To counter fake news - Biontech CEO publishes immunization photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech chief Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
A friend's illness had moved him to do so, Şahin told him.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a coronavirus vaccine.
On social media, there was false information that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network.
"For several months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me on which I am being vaccinated to counter these false rumors".
So far, he had refused because communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He had not asked for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, often fueled by misinformation and distrust".
Fear is difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was released in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not allowed to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time.
There was a prioritisation in Germany of the vaccination of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech chief has been vaccinated three times according to the appropriate data.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had crippled a substation.
After a fire with serious damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to do without electricity for about 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the fire caused 41,000 affected residents in several communities to lose their lights.
The provider Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power units had been in operation until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely repaired in the late evening.
Firefighters and volunteers from THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The provider thanked the people concerned for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the municipalities concerned, the district, the fire departments and THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the primary technology department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few days to complete, as the Westnetz-Monteure were initially only able to take some lines back into operation for a provisional period, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Current flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at around 7.15 p.m. in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation severely damaged parts of the 10,000 volt switchgear.
There was a need for extensive cleaning and repair work.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level had been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 6 p.m. more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth would have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 9.30 p.m.
Since 11.15 p.m., the last ones affected by the failure would also have electricity.
More than 80 assemblers of Westnetz and partner companies had been in use.
The authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance after the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is now important that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and report to the local fire department stores when help is needed," explained District Councillor Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
During the installation and operation of emergency power units, the main focus was on the residents of old people's homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places have been set up in schools for those people who could not provide for themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or who are dependent on medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy these from you and pay in euros?
It is the daily blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy
But I can't mount this underframe on the tabletop.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are three of these.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #Number#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push them together and shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I'd have to send her back, otherwise she's not suitable for the purpose.
I would be pleased to receive a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it like this!
Will you send me the return form by e-mail?
The repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost insolent.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic combination: combiner Riiber wins
German Nordic combined riders Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.

To make the paint application even and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry off.
Before you put the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke next to stroke.
A slight overlap of the paint layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid wiping back and forth quickly with the brush.
This creates unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones might otherwise appear later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come at the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal loops can occur when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you install them.
The models achieve a true look through the decals or decals.
From emblems on airplanes to ship names to trims and license plates in car models: The decals give the model the finishing touch.
Attach the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or more easily before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are when gluing time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut each required decal individually and set it up for you.
Decals are also called water slides, because you briefly moisten their back with water until the carrier paper becomes dark through the wetness.
Then you only push the picture a small piece of paper and place the piece on the appropriate place on the model (which you also moistened before).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper away sideways.
Attention: Always check if the picture is sitting properly before you push it completely from the paper so that it does not stick to the finger, crease or even tear.
Suck out excess water with a household towel.
Warning not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time as soon as I look for something else, then I don't read the book anymore and have to unsubscribe and register and reload the book and look for the place until where I have read.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 individual packages with me
Okay, thank you so much anyway!
I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But can I get that back without a problem?
Child-request treatment with PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello, everybody.
we were in child wish treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, this suddenly turns across.
One by one:
We had applied to the PKV for the children's wish route in advance and received the confirmation of 3 tests.
The experiments were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not calculate them with the PKV.
We again applied for the cost of the PKV and were granted another 3 further attempts.
After some further tests (we have carried out more tests than promised, logically count the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the invoices at the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV only wants to refund 3 tests.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth the other 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second wish for a child was a new case of insurance.
According to the General Terms and Conditions, however, "the insurance case begins with the medical treatment, it ends when there is no longer any need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Would the PKV have had to tell us in the pledges that further attempts will be made with one birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give your opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to get them back to me
All right.
We're not going to order anything from them anymore.
When they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost good customer.
They are welcome to forward this to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the repayment was arranged and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't help it that the dresser gets to me completely disturbed
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It's clear that the repayment was initiated and I still haven't received any repayment via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, I can't get another kind of packaging.
I will be able to remove the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
What a low budget film is exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find plenty of low-budget movies on the web, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What's bothering you?
And what don't you like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you very much.
Sincerely,
There is no phone number, a chat, where you have to wait 30min, is no chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll give up soon, because it just doesn't work here.

"Half victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the evangelical press service (epd).
The EU had not solved the confrontation sustainably, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) said.
This floating state - Belarus does not give in very small, but the EU feels that it is a winner - is likely to go on for a while.
The handling of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It does not seem to prevail if a Member State is in the head of doing its thing", as currently Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU would pay a further price for its policy on the border with Belarus, said Bossong: A fundamental agreement on asylum policy would be made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" had been strengthened.
Renewed attempt to cross the border
According to Poland's border guards, however, migrants have once again tried to reach Poland via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested the night after Sunday and brought back to the border, said a spokesperson for the agency on Sunday.
The Polish officials were stoned in the incident near Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically taken care of by a military doctor.
A total of 52 attempted border crossings were registered within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as a ruler in Minsk of having attracted them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have sealed off border zones.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to people's countries of origin to prevent departures.
The most effective element of EU response is pressure on airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions".
Minsk also had to take internal political costs into account.
Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to smuggle thousands of people through the country on a regular basis.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an objection.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a supposed violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase when he is said to have overtaken irregularly.
A second objection was filed against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had raced to his first Formula One title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you.
thanks for the support
Free entry for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg Fan Day
The Europa-Park, named after the Europa-Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited guests to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the sport club from the Breisgau and members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains lit red and white through the jerseys that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," says the park.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the cooperation between the Bundesliga and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it was again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans who have fun together in the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
why is the €#NUMBER# and not as originally 1699€ ?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "At Home" and also acted as a presenter.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
I gave up the contact form yesterday to return an article, but did not receive an email confirmation or the like.
My question would be whether my question was received.
It does not everyone have the time for your stupid chat and falsely delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake you fix and not all from our household.
Contact Ms #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
Yesterday we had chatted and agreed that I or Mrs #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a back label.
This e-mail hasn't come yet.
The package wants to take to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
Sincerely,
The LokSound 5 decoder can play up to 10 channels simultaneously.
Each channel can be dissolved with up to 16 bits / 31250 kHz and finally offers HiFi quality on your system.
There is virtually no difference to the original any more audible.
A Class-D audio amplifier with up to 3W output power controls the speakers, which may have between 4 Ohm and 32 Ohm impedance.
The huge 128 Mbit sound storage provides enough capacity.
All individual noises can be individually adjusted in volume.
The superflexible sound engine without a rigid schedule allows the model-specific simulation of all conceivable rail vehicles.
Three separately adjustable brake functions and two alternative load scenarios give you maximum control over your vehicles.
I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semitic means nothing.
It's like when an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Both of you won't admit it to your i.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just leave it completely.
Yeah, wow, then you're just as little serious as Kollegah.
Who seriously questions evolution in principle is simply completely lost.
Because of me, a god started the whole thing.
But as soon as you're creative, you have to believe that Earth is 10,000 years old and science is all nonsense.
And with that, you're an enemy of science and you can't take it seriously like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass to the edge zone without any colour defects.
Magnifying magnifiers are often marked with magnifications.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your magnifying glass optimally, we ask you to follow the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections arise on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - also in impact magnifiers.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
If the optimum conditions of use are observed - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Tannenverkauf in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some curious situations when selling firs.
One day, even without his partner, a man is said to have returned home because both of them were unable to agree.
Every year, he plants a good 2,000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced a number of curious situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas period a bit funny, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I left as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to have discussions about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And so they both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "turner", which by far doesn't sound so delicious.
Problems with fiber optics + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a couple of weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable wifi network.
Before, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connector and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent out a good 50 Mbit except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, these also arrive.
However, the other DLan module, which sends out the Wifi, no longer reaches the full 500, but the further I remove myself in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. using a socket that is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before ('45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why fiber optic "lost" so much Internet speed over the power line?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely complicated to install LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased to receive an answer.
When it is time to change the current account
Who would have thought now would be quiet at the current accounts, sees himself mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to let themselves be confirmed with all sorts of tricks by their customers the fee increases of the past, the allowances for negative interest rates continue to decrease.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous for a long time with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the allowance and even quartered it for the daily money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group's Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and 25.000 euros for overnight money accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesman on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, just as it did at ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all: More than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which have even been right in the first instance before the regional court Berlin against this regulation.
Now the banks are already discussing whether institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that the upper authorities also declare negative interest rates inadmissible in principle and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She's officially at the top of Hollywood now.
But her life is like a descent.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by U.S. magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who made a furor in 2021 with the "Friends" reunification and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she gives herself a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of the female and male fans fly to her in the same way is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just lucky - and she's still looking for love.
And canceled the baby wish from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurting.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula One went even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped his sweat off his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight gang contact, Räikkönen had to turn off his Alfa Romeo at the Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi after less than half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finished his career in the motorsport king class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 Ferrari World Championship.
He made 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times off the pole and came 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich brings 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in twoerbob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
"I have calculated this once, I would have to win nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina in 2026," said the double Olympic champion of the BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the Winterberg races.
Only on Saturday did he ward off the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed something about the material setting and drove out a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed in front of the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier finished third.
"We have gone on greater risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also introduced his 22nd victory in series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth after second place this time.
Christoph Ofer of the BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after fourth place in the first race.
"If I knew what he'd do differently, I'd do the same," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte won the third win of the season in the Zweierbob on her home track.
After only finishing fourth on the previous day in the Monobob, she raced for the World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple success with pusher Deborah Levi.
Two-erbob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded the first podium spot this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium spot in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama takes me with her.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," Burghardt said, stressing: "It's not just pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka got a little angry about the not quite error-free rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I just didn't receive it and therefore I couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked for it.
By means of Corona I had quite different problems last year and never time for it.
And now it's said he's expired and I'm very upset.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I want to give it back and then order again, since it is just reduced :)
Why is shipping only started on 16.3.
There was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tap it comes an extra field with the message
Was taken off yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrong delivery.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the entire order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write and maybe there's one or another of them...
I'm 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or goes to kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is ill, has had a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we have cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because hand is in bandage wg burning).
He's also cooled and we're seeing less (1-2x week) at the moment, which makes me very uncomfortable with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child just has a stomachache, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his cuddly blanket and relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now there is also housework for us, which we of course split up.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD disease is very well adjusted, I am halfway well treated and manage.
Not good, but I can handle it and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I didn't do anything and the day after tomorrow Anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare a little something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But after that, the whole thing goes on?
Just until your birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holiday.
Just till the weekend.
Just until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I'm packing this ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't...
Is that how you guys are?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't put that into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think that has a lot to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I'd find some kind of sufferer here...
I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has print.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, I'll get another color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBERS#.
Two more times, by the way.
But she was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I found out at school that many religious teachers don't believe in God and it's just another subject for them, like math or geography.
It was always a bit strange to me, perhaps also because I was raised in a Christian way and so I always believed somehow.
How do you feel about that?
You may also be able to tell about work and study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would just be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Keeping culture or something?
Hope you're asking isn't too private.
Can't it be changed or not?I like to write in English that I understand well
That's been a long time, then I'd say no
All right, thank you.
I'm expecting a quick response by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thanks for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a film from my childhood (bin 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, modernism (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it more in the real world anyway, there's a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the Caribbean curse).
For some reason, the paths cross and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live himself.
I believe the passage is also the grave of the soldier.
In the end, I believe both soldiers fight against each other.
If that tells you anything, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little girl just slept on her stomach from week one.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child like that can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything's right around it, no cuddly animals, go in and look more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That's what drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Ahso and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your kid when he's asleep.
Is it turning your head aside?
Can it straighten up from the belly?
Or is it with the face forward right in the mattress?
That's what you can tell if everything's all right.
We all grew up, too, and when my husband was born, it was like gang and that you put the kids on your stomach to sleep.
In addition, we are already "regular customer" with you and have already bought a lot of products
But then why do you offer me only 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote with a colleague of yours yesterday and I haven't received any feedback yet.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the closet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not to be used at the moment.
To put it quite clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV, too.
But it's just that the policy of this station is now under control.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one is an "independent" Internet station.
Quote Arno: One wants "not to be a running Litfass column".
What do you do now?
A 0815 advertising station trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, they're for everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
They may of course continue to offend people.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking in empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How do you think it's all good?
Great if you like it, I think it's awful.
I ask for a return call as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Corpus rupture due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter with stomach ache or just to cuddle – My little warm friend can be used in many different ways.
Cherry core pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry cores can absorb heat very well and dispense dosed again.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry core pillow with a cover is suitable as a thermal coating only for the following application areas:
Before heating the pillow, check for untypical smell, stick or burn spots and discard immediately in case of presence.
Please take the inside cushion out of the cover to warm up beforehand!
Warm up in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (note the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, spread the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion in the cover.
The first heats can cause a slight build-up of moisture on the surface, but it disappears in repeated applications.
Be sure to stick to the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy performance can lead to damage (inflammation and combustion risk!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is permitted in the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) at your elbow!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish conditions, circulatory disorders, fresh haematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as in persons with reduced pain sensation.
In the case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumours and pregnancy, please contact a doctor prior to use.
If seams have opened and loose nuclei are leaking, discard the product and the loose nuclei immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be regularly checked during use to rule out overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after second series - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 works from the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt it does not run under the third coach.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover via interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply alone was enough for operation.
Missing display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite plugged in power supply.
That's when I removed the battery, but there's nothing going on here.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in power mode?
Is there something else that's broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is....
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 backpack from Peak Design!
20 litres capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold parts.
And what else you need in everyday objects remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2) the series presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalistic design has it literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the backpack's interior while still providing instant access to photo equipment.
This works with two possibilities: Once conventionally over the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the Messenger Bags.
There is a metal hook with matching anchor beams at the front of the backpack in the closure flap.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered various "filling levels": there are 4 anchor beams, stable riveted, into which the hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it's rather empty, a lower one.
The flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be closed reliably without snapping the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday backpack from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of traditional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to dig through the content!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday fitness of the backpack enormously: if you not only take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack you can individually configure the interior (more about it below) and thus store both of them separately without any problems - and access it independently through the two side openings.
So you can also pull the backpack in front of the body from the right side, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safe in the left half of the backpack and do not get in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if they are to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately I wait in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# emailed me yesterday from confirmation for ordering the
Contact announced by the forwarding company to pick up the wrongly delivered table.
I haven't received a message so far.
I'm asking for immediate resolution.
I'm already writing with the third support employee, with no one I could go further than to the promise that I would receive an email as confirmation.
This is the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#
It is clear when the cabinet could be returned?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help
Have a nice evening
hello, my order is #Number#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher, I will place a larger order right away, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And that the past year went differently than I thought, I couldn't guess and just couldn't redeem and clarify it in time.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates the reliability and safety of braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then machined mechanically (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are peculiar to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which with the balancing of the disc depends on the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tuned discs manufactured in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake blocks.
Aesthetic properties of our tuned discs underline the character of each car by their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although trying to keep his discovery secret, the news spread rapidly, triggering the so-called ‘California Gold Rush’ of ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were set up, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many people it was "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for yourself.
You'll look for gold, recruit workers, rally horses, and build companies.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You must surpass your pioneer colleagues to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, you need to budget with your resources, and you need to build a tableau that is "working" more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions, or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the map where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables half of the site - thus reducing the possible actions there.
Players then take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning revolver heroes.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The prizer turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions.
This continues until the promoter has moved five times, thus covering every location once and the year ends.
There's a shootout where players have to defend Coloma from a robbery of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough revolver heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive fewer rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most winning points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Media Center
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation showed up in my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce educational debate.
Former patient: now serious accusations are being made against him by those entitled to education.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
We parents and other responsible people must never, never, never! for power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for its development and to make the framework for the child as big as it is meaningful and possible in the situation.

Holetschek: Countries advise on the elimination of testing requirements for triple-vaccinated vehicles
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide elimination of the test obligation for triple vaccinations.
"We countries quickly need clarification as to whether and when the test requirement can be eliminated for three times of vaccination," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, the "Picture on Sunday".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccines is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal for this to the Health Ministers Conference next Tuesday". − afp
So I want to send the lamp back
What's the best way to do that?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't do any more shopping through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Ups, an error occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I updated account data.
What can this be about?
What you describe is referred to as "awareness", i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 to 1000.
It is most common to hear sounds/voices, less often to see images, and most rarely to perceive pain.
Relevant for this topic: caesarean sections are operations that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anaesthesia is avoided for the protection of the child until abnabling.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during anaesthesia preliminary discussion.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex ** by definition none.
I misread her comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ will not help us.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the area of eCommerce.
Please check again if you at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We're losing a lot of money.
I've already sent you an e-mail that you haven't answered.
Again, the question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is the company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told they were only delivering to the front door because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know any person who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
am I not being called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has distinguished himself as a theatre critic and as an intendant.
He later wrote a monumental theatre history.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man is getting older".
The shocking diarium of a slow farewell to the world led by theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I testify here already my life thank you".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are euro pallets, standardised wooden pallets, which are used primarily in the European area as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association (EPAL)
According to Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported into Austria annually is not collected
New York wins MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After the 1:1 in the regular season against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
That was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thanks again for :)
Now I have come to taste and want to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I'll set up a cattle fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I can do that
IEs is about a refund of €#NUMBERS#
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But to this day, the money has not been received by me.
Would you check there, please?
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck belongs to Christmas days such as the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
Time's running out.
We'll tell you where you'll get another Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controllers, you can set the desired level and the crushing content of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller, with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything at the "gain" and the distortion.
Further up it already sounded that with the POWER LEVEL controller you can even make a power reserve float, if it goes insolently loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controllers, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be exploited in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a box simulation, so that even when using a headphone or direct recordings you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 foot button, you can also conveniently call up the sounds by foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and "take" the pace of the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking a further step into the future!
But that was how others saw it.
Is it possible to send the lamp back to you?
Since it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we receive an update to the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If I can't, I'd be happy with a discount or a voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only more than 1,000 euros for goods I don't need are a lot.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worthwhile
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
According to Iranian figures, progress is being made in the negotiations for a revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the Irna News Agency.
This was a "positive and important development", because at the beginning there was not even a consensus on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement continued after a short one-week break.
The negotiations will involve negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thüringen is the only federal state to have been above the 1000 mark at the Corona Incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute stated the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people severely affected by Covid-19 were treated in intensive medical care in hospitals on Sunday.
Reporting delays can occur on weekends.
In addition, the health authorities have been overburdened for weeks and are hardly lagging behind with the registration of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
here I don't have to click/enter/fill anything else?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is in my eyes an audacity.
It's time for change
↔MFederal Day greet me, I am u/StratorDE in the Chamber Hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's with the mail here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, you can see one thing: it is not extistant.
We got into a winter freeze and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#What's the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to discontent, as some things have gone down here and as we are in general.
In the last few days, the impression has been increased that many here are really still in favour of the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found, simply put, a pile of pieces.
After writing back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to urge everyone to participate once again, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed / adjusted / removed?
* How are we to show outwardness in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot some things, but that's not bad, so we end up with the discord.
If you have time and desire, come to the Discord, work with us, and let us make a democratic decision about the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/klobby for it and not suitable for my taste.
I've already ordered a different suspension for this.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope that this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the daily blanket #PRS_ORG#, is it also in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I'm asking you to do that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but will remove the cabinet as far as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can call me at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a guide for the assembly?
How long would I have time to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question why you're vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself used to live vegetarian for a while, she probably eats meat very rarely at the moment.
I myself was a vegetarian a few years ago.
When asked whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
I thought for a long time that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but at some point I reflected and understood that in the end I also supported animal cruelty.
That's why I decided to be vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that there was displeasure on her side, that she then defended vegetarianism and that she knew where her flesh came from and that she was reducing animal suffering as a vegetarian.
Now I wonder if my answer to 'plump' was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan, you are quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without putting it on.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# will not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am on the assigned date on which #PRS_ORG# does not pick up my returns on site.
Since I can't be there because of a funeral, that's not going to change either.
Can I have an alternative pick-up date, please?
From the 01.02.#NUMBER# I can be found continuously again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a donation notice of 45,000 euros to Lord Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein City Hall for the new water rescue unit of the volunteer fire department Lahnstein.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this," says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment trolley is used by the Lahnstein diver squadron, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is a sustained increase in operations: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the continued increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure flow, contribute to this.
I bought a book which I could only read to 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, however, have synchronized, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING has worked.
I am a little frustrated because the whole action has already taken me a lot of time and hope for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

First of all, thank you for standing up to the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar activity, that is, we were also arms carriers in the executive, and I would not like to go further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that, of course, the state servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, which should actually be clear to everyone.
Of course, it is also clear in the special uniform and arms bearer that people on the right should also be magically attracted by conservatively to everyone, that these people can then of course be difficult to deal with the living reality, because of course you have besides the average white, meanwhile many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine cliché gays, because these exist in the executive rather less to not at all, but quite normal men and women to whom you don't notice it if they don't tell you) and also on these people I can and must rely, because in doubt they save your life or use this for you.
But even if it sounds strange in my experience, these marginal groups also represent a conservative attitude, i.e. are proud of Germany and feel rather less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly advocates them or thinks they have to do it right, in doing so they simply want to be treated as normal.
Back to the right, since, of course, police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they can openly say their opinion there or even openly forge any state-threatening plans is completely exaggerated and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that especially police officers and soldiers who were often in foreign assignments often start to flatten due to negative experiences and also sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
Also it happens that surely also sometimes right contemporaneous ones meet, who conduct a lively exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, I believe that this is well fought and also counteracted by political education and education!
Germany is so intertwined internationally and this is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, which I do not understand, the other basket I have also ordered on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered it, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I was chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still supply the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBERS# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the wooden part are two deep notches filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Ordinary by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy with one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am self-employed, very little free time), but for the rest of my life I have been getting it more bad than right to run my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything stays down, and then and then it grabs me and I clean up and clean.
But it is never really "that someone could come to visit spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) no better either, it disturbs me somewhere but mostly household simply loses against work and displeasure.
The kitchen is cleaned on the most regular as we like to cook.
Now, to my question, have you managed to get better with a child?
We haven't worked on it yet, and this question has been on my mind for some time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me as long as no visit comes and e.g. always fresh clothes are there and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you remain sloppy?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus enables almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and squats)

Career in social work - as someone with a self-confident personality disorder?
I have been training in software development and have now been learning for about a year.
Unfortunately, however, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoiding) personality disorder (EVPS).
That means roughly that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I don't have a problem talking to people on a factual level, but it's very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I've been told a lot of times that I'm acting unapproachable (although I think that's already gotten better).
Can I be a social worker like this?
I do not want to work as a street worker or at an open youth meeting place, but rather in, for example, addiction counselling or family help.
But I don't know if the actual day-to-day work is really the way I imagine it is, and it's hard to find something on the Internet.
The ÄVPS is already leading to problems in my job (for me, emotional), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about my code ("already simple things are fucked up again") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do it by now"/"I keep him away from work with my stupid questions"/"he must really think me less mediated" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession but I wanted to mention it at the point.
But you've already got the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pick-up
What do you mean by giving back please!
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein (protein) taken up with the food disperses the bird into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) in its gastrointestinal tract and builds up its own protein substances from these, which it also needs for the formation of feathers.
The formation of plumage in nesting and the formation of new plumage in the mowing bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with particularly high stress for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be returned.

1 g NEKTON-Bio on 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
A coated measuring spoon (intrinsically) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON organic.
In case of severe plumage damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of the new plumage formation is visible.
The normal dose is then administered until the new plumage formation is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.

Statement of a parish worker in reprobate to the statutes
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have this problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So file application made to the municipality.
A staff member writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and therefore also the walnut is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's testimony or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we'll use them new packaging for it.
I didn't get a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, that's what I think, but the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany.
Can you check that out?

Well, thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas on further professional life
First Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head is thinking up everything you can think of.
Before I get out of here now .. in short: I need advice and best advice from people who somehow know my situation - that is, from you.
I'm just doing the ref as a cross-beginner.
Originally I studied something else and also worked there in one area (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I don't call anything more specific).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point, I ended up at the teacher's office and I was sure that it was - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job advertisements".
And it's only been around for half a year.
At the times before, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after which I can still turn around.
But I'm totally done right now.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely worn out.
Now it's a vacation, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my end of the day was my end.
That's when I was free.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now even the family party is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that bother me additionally.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the Ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely worn out and wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it shuts down completely - if it doesn't already.
I wonder if I would like to have the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or if I should go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but was adequately paid for it and worked together on a team and not as a single fighter like this most of the time.
But then I wonder if I didn't get back to the same place in a year as I am now and dissatisfied.
You realize it's all kind of weird, but maybe you've got outside advice or ideas about how I get out of this situation, which I'm completely done and almost start crying at the slightest thought.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, it probably doesn't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, that's enough for now.
Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny undertone of me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has developed steadily, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the Valve Reactor circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps, of course, also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply achieve the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only bubble.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound and modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which once again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two loudspeakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists will find what they want in search of maximum sound diversity.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: They expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of game dynamics and string stop as well as a prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that especially the power stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of every VT+ amplifier equipped with a 12AX7 tube perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic defeat series in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually foldable Velcro fasteners, it adapts to the needs of your photographic equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack naturally depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible assembly would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a plug-in flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for more lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photo items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the well-known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic Island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still dared not forecast when it could end.
Indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV station RTVE.
Millions of damage
In the three months since the eruption began, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava destroyed almost 2900 residential buildings and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
On the coast, two new promontories with a total size of about 50 hectares were created by cold lava.
It was particularly the banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely affected, the newspaper "El País" wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is at the door and especially the children will not be able to expect the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have something seductive in themselves associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is therefore all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss had been a peace-building "social contract of natural peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom the Christmas days were closely linked with the giving.
Before that, gifts were presented in one way or another on St. Nicholas' Day.
The background of this practice, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold in her window in one night to spare them another life in sin.
This unconventional way of giving was the result of Germany's popular custom of filling the boots with gifts, especially for children.
Protestants clashed with this custom because they reject mediators between God and the people as "holy worship".
For these reasons, they guard against the institution.
Martin Luther made Santa Claus the Christ Child and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift was shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions as closely, it is only a little upset that the custom of Saint Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period, similar to the Martin custom with Martinssingen and Martinsumzug.
Today, in boots at the door and under the Christmas tree, you will find everything your heart desires, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources demonstrate a tradition of giftgiving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was postponed on Christmas Eve.
In all Christian - shaped countries, however, a cheerful kuddel muddle prevails over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region in question whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of Santa Claus, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white noise level, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia, it brought Father Frost to some fame.
It's not reindeer here, it's three horses pulling his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was reported to have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's business.
The man fled according to authorities in a vehicle that could be stopped a little later by officials.
Shots had been fired and the man had been shot.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
There are several embassies in the Kensington Palace area.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is simply placed and can be anchored in the ground with 2 spits.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Duration of illumination max. 10 hours
- The robust plastic design can be used all year round outdoors.
In the Hollywood Spectacle, these are mostly menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow in colour inside.
Quite harmless, however, is »Smart Stone«: The sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly – either in white or coloured light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a natural shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also does well in the neighbourhood of larger pebbles and findlings, where he is able to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself big preparatory work: As a solar lamp »Smart Stone« requires neither supply nor batteries.
Place the »lightstone« in any place illuminated by the sun on the day.
Two supplied ground skewers provide a firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides »Smart Stone« inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery charges already when sunlight falls on the housing.
When dusk falls, »Smart Stone« begins to glow automatically; in what color, you decide for yourself: Six attractive light colours are your choice – in addition to daylight white.
The switch-off is also automatic as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a specified minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts the next day from the front.
I've done this several times, it doesn't work.

Pill problem
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and shitty PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave this again, because I already have to take enough medication because of chronic diseases, which I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten explosive pimples from 0 to 100 at my last about two years break and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but I was very burdened and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this time.
Perfume-free and without eduns, my cosmetics are already, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, gynaecologist didn't take me so seriously and dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, dear skin is such a thing.
Had pre-bupertary severe neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale nodules and the acne theme.
I also tried everything possible in the course of my illness and got stuck on a sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed food, because nothing else worked really well.
It may also be good that hormone is simply the worm in it, but if you have like me everywhere construction site you just don't want to go looking for more what else is going wrong.
I already had everything of her colleague semina o. ä.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I have to work in between and on the phone, and all of a sudden everything was gone...
what is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong

110 kV earth cable to be built in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is final.
The planning decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for the construction, which is to begin in 2022.
This is now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long earth cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts.

No, it is with all books, therefore the request at #PRS_ORG#, because it is probably a general problem
Ref: Planning classes (EK)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I have been in the Ref since summer, I enjoy teaching, but I still have great problems planning my teaching in the field of geography in a time-efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
At school, I can only copy b/w for free (which sucks for Earth's clients).
I just need a long time to plan my hours right now.
For example, we are currently dealing with the subject of geofactors and with me, actually, every hour stands for itself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to spend too much time on simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can teach me how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I'd love to.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBERS#.
I have actually already decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to do the return as soon as possible.
The trade fears about the 2G scheme for Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed to enter.
Trade thinks this is unnecessary and complains about a decline in sales.
He also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for the retail trade.
In the case of transactions with articles of non-daily need, sales losses were to be complained, criticized HDE chief executive Stefan Genth.
According to a recent HDE survey among 1100 traders, more than 70 percent of companies had a negative view of the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without ground," said Genth.
Thus, traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis figures in the last week.
It is only good in the food retail and online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief executive.
"2G shopping doesn't bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required high staffing.
The ribbon regulation had to be allowed nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer had to be checked only once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and had access to all shops with the received ribbon on that day.
In addition, sampling checks should be sufficient in retail trade, as in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
Deutsche Euroshop, a real estate company specializing in shopping malls, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of such an important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Business Week".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the Centers are trying to find and approve solutions.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors can, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central location in the center and afterwards - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - enter all shops undisturbed". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error, which was tried to be covered with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to operate.
The lamp produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees with which you can illuminate large surfaces at a relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the lamp in television studios or when the lamp is mounted in hard-to-access places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory Memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory spaces, simply press one of the memory keys for longer and finish.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that the known situation is restored when switching on - Very convenient when working in the studio if e.g. the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester also included - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with electricity via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for attachment as a connection, so you can directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination is to be set reliably by means of locking devices on both sides.
It has been ensured that the mechanical components are extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included.
Great is that a bag is included in the delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy without problems.
Too bad I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after scoring comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two-time victoryless Hessen were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcy.
But then the SGE turned up, shot within a good hour the frustration about a mixed season start from the soul and won furiously with 5:2. "It's madness what the boys did today", cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke out a "flat-up lob, to every single one who was there".
At first it looked like a new damper for the now in ninth place still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkusen with 2-0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," continues Glasner.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Also defensive player Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the spot again for the first time since the fourth day of the match and his overcome muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result especially for the audience.
That was the party we were going to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but also sees itself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we all have players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professional.
Now one wants to "go on step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks "at this level" until the turn of the year.
Next, a away match with Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky) will take place on Wednesday in the course of the English week.
Gradually I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Would for me then unfortunately mean that I will not order again because it has already taken a long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampers for handball women before quarter-finals against Spain
Germany's handball women crept from the parquet after humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty looks.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB selection took a bitter defeat in the 16:32 (8:13) ahead of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were far too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said Federal coach Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8–2 points as second behind the Danes (10–0).
It's a pity we couldn't take the flow.
This was a bad game for everyone, which we have to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for entry into the semi-finals, a significant increase must be made against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," conceded backroom player Xenia Smits, demanding: "We have to look forward quickly now".
Not in height from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team with the whistle was not at the height.
Faults and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 residue after seven minutes.
Only goalwoman Dinah Eckerle was immediately on operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick kickback.
However, this was not the initial ignition that was hoped for.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes, the German women could hardly put themselves in the limelight - and if they did, they mostly failed due to the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
So the game had run early in the 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backroom player Mia Zschocke also saw red a little later due to a hard foul on her opponent.
However, she is allowed to participate again in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get a little better into the game and reach at least five goals until the break.
The anyway only quiet hope for a catch-up after the change was already seven minutes away at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to raise its performance and went off the stage as a clear loser.

I'd like to give you a voucher code
as with #PRS_ORG# poison vouchers
Is that possible with them?
The title gives it, I am active as an immunization doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated especially in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to be a large part finished, it then partly continues in vaccination centers for me.
I gladly answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, if they are not related to one personally (e.g. "I take drug X, this is compatible with the vaccination ..").
In my area of responsibility is the information for the vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to Coronaimpfveverordnung and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (I never happened).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often don't have any, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, who can't carry out any vaccinations (may?), so that I also carry out most vaccinations myself.
Severe "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a Huidler?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television program "Wir in Bayern" has caused violent thinking.
But unlike many previous days, the term remained un guessed by the callers in the series "Host mi?" this time.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one "who needs to go fast."
That, people heard from the TV host, was completely wrong.
To which the man from Amberg shared the solution and thus probably also caused many Upper Palatinates to wonder.
"The Huidler," the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, surveyed as an expert by Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatine term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
Which closed a gap in education - probably also among some who have lived in the area of Amberg for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books in two weeks.
The following error message always occurs after confirmation: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tyre selection on the road bike - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy because I wanted to train at least a little in preparation for my bike tour next week.
Said, done and I drove my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice too - but then what is happening in so every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) lurks.
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire did not want to join the rest of the track any more.
Since due to the weekday I had no real possibility to get spare coat and spare hose, I had to turn around again with a half bad mood and take the first train home.
Was then also not quite so bad in terms of mood, maybe it is also better, if I practice again before the bike tour with the tyre change.
But now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance in front of me for several days, I would be very reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because also the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, came the day I came to pick up the bike until 2 pm 120km torn off!) and who had already called it as a suboptimal because he drove with them for several years on roll.
But if I think that I still have to make a tyre change when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I have come into conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me wondering why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these should be unplattable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so impasseable?
I don't feel like spending 40€/tyres now, just to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I think I have 25x622 on the road bike right now.
They are also available (apparently?) at the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me on a road bike generally to other tires?
The swallow side seems to me absolute! Lay knowledge rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and greetings!
Car hurls against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had bounced against a central island on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car from an unexplained cause and subsequently got onto the opposite runway, as the police reported.
There, a frontal collision occurred with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then hurled against a tree and the man was trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to surrounding hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end wideband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would be reborn.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and visually reminds of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitable designed foot directly to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
As a matter of principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather minor role, but the sound is to be reached at an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to generate such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
This does not mean, however, that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears remarkably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal, the SOLO 15 was matched with a slight high-pitch rise.
This is common in widebands in order to optimize the too high frequencies strongly increasing bundling.
Precisely oriented to the listening area, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
The tweeter range can be reduced slightly to the outside and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the positioning of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and astonishingly precise.
The reference-suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamic that is looking for its same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution capacity and battery rate.
As with all our kits, it is recommended to start by thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan corresponding changes in the construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the housings, the lowering of the speaker must be adapted accordingly, as the veneer again applies material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the DIY store), one should first drill an 8 mm hole into the bottom plate at the appropriate point in order to be able to perform the cable without problems there later.
With the help of an upper milling machine, the speaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used flush later.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° chassis to make the opening surface of the loudspeaker chassis as large as possible.
The four bolting points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail chamfer".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now glued onto these.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in the material thickness if necessary, if, for example, you want to use finished strips from the DIY market instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
The next step is to install the second page.
Then follow all plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circular saw or a Forstner drill, it is easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection clamp on the back wall.
A round milling cutter is then used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded.
The base plate is then firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wooden screws.
It follows the drawing and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the bolting points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (sucking / blowing out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
Here you push the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the foot to the terminal opening and let it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, the cable leads to the speaker opening and also allows it to hang out loosely.
The crossover is prepared and used below.
The building plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan can be taken from the following document: Installation instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the seal of the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box follows, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, hot glue can be dripped onto the opening and thus closed.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp the sealing can be checked accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus cable (marked cable) must be soldered at the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to everyone,
> Finally, we can announce that we are organizing the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the switch, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic – yet we will give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Get some drinks cold, plan some good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
