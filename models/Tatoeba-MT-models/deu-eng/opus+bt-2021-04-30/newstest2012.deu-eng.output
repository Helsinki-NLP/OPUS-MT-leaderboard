No liberating amendment for Tymozhenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today denied the request to abolish, as part of an amendment to the Criminal Code, those clauses on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the liberation of the imprisoned ex-premier minister, was rejected by MEPs at the second reading of the request to mitigate the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for the conclusion of an allegedly negative contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, the appeal of the convicted is to be brought to court in December.
Timoshenko himself describes the verdict as political revenge of the regime and also in the West, the trial raised suspicion of the bias of the court.
The request to remove Section 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was convicted, from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The story of Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As usual in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council professed the customary right of the Shar'a, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft, you cut off your hand in a nutshell.
Women, too, should quickly forget thoughts of emancipation, any apostates of faith will be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will in future be united by the Koran from opposing tribes.
In short, Libya will have an order that is hardly conceivable in this country and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively seen probably not the best and would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans.
In this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters let themselves be helped by the unbelieving dogs at all.
To their excuse may only serve the fact that NATO's airstrikes were not directed by any General from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The victors in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in a shooting change, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians disbanded themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any advantage whatsoever.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the locals are free of a concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
But do the oil companies get the black gold at a mock price even without occupation?
Hardly, and so the West can finally boast of its selflessness in the protection of human rights.
If this does not destroy the Shar'a representatives for them.
Start of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm hit Europe.
The individual countries published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France increasing.
The bond market is breaking all records today.
Investors are keeping an eye not only on Greece, but also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5% and France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France admitted a slight decrease of 0.1% (initial data only referred to stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Czech Statistical Office, the trend towards a slowdown in economic performance was thus confirmed.
The results are therefore worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in this third quarter, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to provisional and seasonally overestimated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the eurozone as a whole and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy contracted by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield on their 10-year government bonds climbed to 28.45%.
The return on Italian and Spanish government bonds increased to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The yield on Czech government bonds is below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, voices are voiced that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-placed goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent goal of Petr Jiráček, she won 1-0 in Montenegro.
With a great deal of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from the home game and will once again not be missing at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the promotion game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro quite happily 1-0 and has thus redeemed their ticket for the European Football Championship.
Also because of the precise defence game of the Czech team, they could not put more pressure on the Montenegrins until the second half.
The pitch birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be participating in the European Championships next year, and it is also gratifying that domestic football will receive a premium of about 200 million.
From the first minutes on, quite fighting football was played.
Both teams combined tediously and so was played mainly around the middle line.
Also in the second half the pressure of the home team remained out and the far-reaching defeats before the penalty area were successfully repelled by the Czech defences.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object Tuesday noon and then announced death to the US and Israel.
On Tuesday, a few hundred students from the University of Isfahan, Iran, formed a living shield around the core technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
With this they wanted to make it clear that they are willing to protect their country's core program, even with their own lives, if necessary.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran seems to have long since abandoned its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, talks about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed in front of the entrance to the complex at noon and then announced death to the US and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, in the event of an attack intended to paralyze the Iranian nuclear program, the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan's target would also be out of the centre in Isfahan.
The menu of a fat-hungry child: It does not eat breakfast and eats sausage for dinner
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important the environment is for the healthy development of a human being, in which he grows up and are the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more frequently on the table than in families where normal - weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had fries for dinner on the day before the educational campaign under the motto "Adiposity is not a coincidence".
In families with fat children, sport is also not one of the favourite activities, which also affects the majority of today's students - only 15 percent replied that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic being surveyed.
This was already the second year of the "Adiposity is not a coincidence" campaign, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Fund and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes have participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are decisive factors that are responsible for the horrifying increase in the number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed, for example, said eating breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-vesper dinner five times a day - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet," one of the survey results says.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that relative small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students' families have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone has breakfast for themselves.
Worst of all was the finding that in every tenth family there is no breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered to be the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
Among other things, the survey test revealed that in the families of overweight children people often consume unhealthy fries.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
While more than 40 percent of the children surveyed exercise, only less than half of their parents do so - only 15 percent.
Set up your own menu
Another part of the survey made it possible for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own meal plan from the possibilities offered by appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite dishes were many flours, meat dishes and, of course, desserts.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonades", is emphasized in the final report to this survey.
At lunch, i.e. the main course, pasta was victorious just before poultry.
The children almost didn't like legumes and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Returning to Health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after completing the enlightening presentation "Adiposity is not a coincidence", there was in many cases a marked shift in preferences towards principles of healthy nutrition", the results of the project are quoted.
This was eye-catching, for example, with the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed poultry or fish much more often in the questionnaire as the main course of the day and were ready to eat less dumplings or sweet food.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I had a bit moaned that this was a bit too much stuff for the beginning.
I didn't know in the least what else was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the square" works.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the test approaches, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we debated with Director Alena (not a single man participates in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideal proportional figure.
And that's what most of us are.
Some have one too short neck, the others have a too young figure without proper curves and others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to optically cover wide shoulders, extend the neck or conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to attract a female type like Jennifer Lopez - i.e. with a large bust, wide hip and narrow waist - pretty and figure-stressed, without making her seem too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so big that the skirt or pants really don't fit, you should at least have a piece tailored to your needs.
You won't regret this, because well-fitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt, you feel much better than in one of the poles, which is always too high and slippery, standing in the waist, etc.
Young figures can in turn allow themselves to wear clothing with folds, buffs, applications, embroidery or ruffle.
With this amount of information and figure types, I'm glad that I have a whole week to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet, I'm afraid that, given the assigned homework, it's almost impossible.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity to create suitable outfits for - day wear and evening robe.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, whom you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
On the inside I cheer, because this is much better for me personally than, for example, putting on Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased in recent times to a hundred kilos (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the garments from magazines or search for them on the Internet, print them out and then print them.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, then our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But it's not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday presentation filled with information about figure types was seasoned by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit this.
And a mailed stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in a very different way.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over the jeans as usual, like a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heels and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or collar and the whole look looks completely different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of all, the following advice came to mind: "First, you must know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," said Jakub.
At last, I realize why we have to timpani all these teachings, what you can combine with what and why, even if you often get to see quite different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothes on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes look quite different than in reality.
So you have to expect all of this in the design of the outfit.
Jan Pokorný confirmed that image and styl sometimes make up half of the success.
You just have to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also well-known personalities often consider this to be thrown out money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look secondary).
And if one of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely force us to a very different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then all you have to do is google to find out for sure that the tabloid press writes that the corresponding celebrity has returned to or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario encouraged us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "build together" the outfit.
In his work, he must first of all communicate with the people he styles and he must be a cunning psychologist.
Appreciating people without making an offer and standing up to his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to sift through her closet and add some pretty pieces, then we can't clean out the whole closet and tell her - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to which you recommend what you can contribute," says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what such a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So this is a bag that you button at the waist and carry all the necessary proprieties with you.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, hair-removing dispensers or safety pins, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (the stylist helps to photograph products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are gathered in the back if they are too large (pins or other clamps are prohibited so that the fabric does not break) and, of course, sewing tools.
But so that we not only have to listen, but can also try something practical, we learned how to glue shoes properly.
Also when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, one can damage the soles of the shoe, let alone the outside.
We were stuck and glued...
With the scissors one must not even touch the shoes, so that one does not damage them.
So you really have to be smart.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was only a fraction of what we heard at the second weekend continuing course.
One thing has become clear to me now - to devote yourself to styling on a professional level is no child's play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree ride becomes a routine journey to the early shift due to a series of completely avoidable, dilettant errors.
Although it succeeded in fulfilling the ambitions to a large extent, what good is that, if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the counters, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" raised high expectations.
He promised to move the already year-old game series "Need for Speed" into a new dimension again and in the playable demonstration examples he did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious how the fitted passages would turn out, in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you're used to with NFS, in the end, many things are different than you expected.
Sure - potentially there are quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is diminished by some superfluous mistakes, which have been present in this series more or less for a few years.
So there are actually no more mistakes, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
First, one is introduced to history, whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, that is, on the west coast, you sit on the wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race takes place on a different track and that the individual stages take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don't have a moment to think that game would offer the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the journey through the desert, through autumnal landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape looks visually very pleasant.
Occasionally, atypical elements bring a little variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts vision.
In the mountains, on the other hand, one has to be infernally careful that one is not spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well in succession.
Only a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classical race against the stopwatch), then you still expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And there's also the police that's trying to screw up the whole thing.
A novelty is passages in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less such passages in the game than one would expect (probably only three).
Ultimately, this is more of a benefit to the matter, because this element at least has no chance of getting bored - it belongs in the context of the above-mentioned to the elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today's point of view, it does not tear out trees, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But the local driving model continues to do quite well for action-packed racing, although one could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything will be fine.
Real problems only appear after some time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not entirely O.K.
A game of this kind is hardly to be expected to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no idea how the car behaves before hitting any object, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: In the narrow overtaking or passing of oncoming cars, one "strips" in some places the other cars only slightly, but in other, almost identical situation one gets into spinning and turns wild pirouettes.
Or drive the car right to scrap.
Thanks to the Restart system, it doesn't matter anymore, it's always annoying.
The restarts are solved like this: if you have total damage or land far off the track, then the game throws you back to the last clue of the track.
Only - in each race you only have five Restarts.
Once you've exhausted it, it all starts from the beginning.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't succeed, but you shouldn't rely on it.
Sometimes, however, even the rest kind does not help, there nothing else but to learn the critical section from the head.
It is extremely unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, you have to go through in a very specific way, otherwise you simply don't fit through.
Elsewhere, at the corresponding point, you always encounter "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you are the first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the opponent is passing by two oncoming cars in front of a playful one, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around them or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed so that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you are always overtaken at the same place by the same opponent and here again without regard to the time.
This is the craziest thing to complete the game on the long bridge you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent obviously has to get you out of here on the devil.
And if he's in front of you, then of course he takes the view, so that you drive your own car a few times in Klump.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly spoils the joy of the game.
And that's a pity, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is generally quite entertaining and sometimes also so action-packed that you almost no longer know where your head is.
And in principle it doesn't matter what is "guilty" about it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can occur, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the car change in the course of the races.
One should not overlook the petrol stations on the route, because it is precisely here that you can change the car, although in most cases the car is sufficient that you have right now.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
The task mode (challenges) also goes hand in hand with the mode of the game history - i.e. the races in the individual locations known from history.
There are not only medals, but also points of experience to gain for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and the story.
In order to get to the higher driver level, various items need to be opened up: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time connected with the online function Autolog, which compares among other things its own achieved results with those of other players and also provides for further collective functions.
One of other unintelligible carvers is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you get by car into a subway tunnel (for my sake), where you race in the dark on the rails long (for my sake).
On the speedometer numerals look between 150 a 200 km/h (for my sake), but suddenly a subway comes from behind and drives an uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial office, we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and here and there even brilliant.
It is all the more annoying that at some exciting moments the refresh rate slows down and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this applies in particular to accidents involving a greater number of people, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound reproduction is OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to reach out to a young audience as broad as possible, a soundtrack a lá "of everyone something" was created - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game was not mitigated by the aforementioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we could have claimed with the boob tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems kind of unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but one should be prepared that these mistakes stab you in the eye with the power of airport headlights.
Concert of the "Students of the Velvet Revolution" with vocal ensembles of the Karlsuniversität
The Festival Festa Academica now offers for the third time the combination of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution and this together with the musical experience.
Over the course of the festival, the twenty professional and university choirs will present themselves.
The focus of the festival is on the two concerts, which take place on 17 November.
"Karlsuniversität has a large share in the festival."
"Among the participants is also the choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanist Studies, and the festival committee includes the rector Václav Hampl," said Jakub Čaloun, head of the organizing team.
The absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of technical school choirs, which takes place on 17 November from 2 p.m. on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The programme includes the composition of the important Czech jazz musician Karel Rşıička "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evening hours, the concert "Students of the Velvet Revolution" (Studenty Sametu) takes place in the gala rooms of the Volkshaus in Vinohrady, in which also university choirs perform, choirs of the Karlsuniversität are not excluded.
Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate the World Student Day with dignity and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present choral music to the public at the highest level and to promote the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organiser is the Association of Czech Choirs in cooperation with Johannes-Kepler-Gymnasium.
The patron of the entire event was Bohuslav Svoboda, the Lord Mayor of Prague and Václav Hampl, the Rector of Charles University.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
The schedule includes numerous music meetings, student cappanings, matinees and other events in addition to festival concerts.
Detailed information can be found on the website of the festival www.festaacademica.cz
EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has put the balance between the various institutions out of balance."
I didn't expect such a hard war to flare up."
"It will take five or six years for the waves to smooth out and everyone to get used to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her presentation to the Faculty of Law quite sharply.
In the first part of her lecture, she showed how seriously she takes the motto "Comprehensive and open about Europe", in which she succeeded in describing the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have envied many lecturers of the Faculty of Law at Karlsuniversität.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism was voiced that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who couldn't handle such a role, but I must say that it took everyone's breath away as well as he took care of it.
"He is a person who manages to listen patiently to, communicate with, and, above all, have clear ideas about how to continue with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it as an answer to the question: Who is this actually - the European Union? What number should I call?", that is, as an important step towards the agreement and easier readability of EU policies towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us our oil-caps Quargel
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived, lives and intends to live in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency of two years ago as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and had also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the government's case during the Presidency as a major negative that had seriously harmed the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has its hands full.
In the words of the Ambassador, not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, has been quite hectic.
And there is still a need to approve the EU's seven-year budget, which makes matters much more complicated precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and economical budget, which sectors of the economy will receive priority, which countries will receive more and which countries will receive less support - all this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Understanding Europe".
"If I don't like something, it's grayish abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.
How am I supposed to know, as a citizen, whether people in Brussels are really crooked or round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes, or whether someone is actually trying to ban us from the quarks.
It would also have liked to have used the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in prospect
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics who perceive more the negative than the positive side of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and is a Slovak nearby, then the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is that your V4 again?" and doing so makes a pretty sour face.
According to Mrs Vicenové, the EU is expecting the Member States' budget policies to be tough in the future.
As a much more real, as a "European federation", it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"Here we have the countries of the eurozone and the countries away from the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation."
"For the first time, it has been said that only the countries that want it and those who do not want it should stand quietly away."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong "Europe of different speeds", says Vicenová.
In this regard, she also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues with an impact on the EU as a whole must be discussed by all Member States and not just by the eurozone countries.
Brand Story:
The Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to look for a suitable word that characterizes IBM's strategy most accurately, this would probably be the word "longevity".
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, known as a modern company, although a century has passed since it was founded.
The basis for this longevity was already laid by their first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
He already spoke of the slogan that countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" thus became a trademark for the future giant's life (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which was first published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen's thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous move towards the future.
IBM also survived and was successful for a whole century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not hesitate to change everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business, and society over the course of our first century.
We hope that we will achieve even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
Thoughtful system
Watson had already been socializing his employees in the 1930s - in a way similar to the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had paid leave as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a thoughtful pay system for the best innovators and traders.
IBM's long-term relationships with its customers are just as sophisticated.
The company was brilliant in talent promotion from the beginning - as one of the first companies in the world IBM lifted any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan will replace at the head of IBM next year by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she has taken the position of Sales, Marketing and Strategy Director.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings in recent years, resulting in many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution of good reputation
Their unwavering position in business guarantees the company a strong image and this to the inside and outside.
"From the very beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist, the professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies," added George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself points out, it is a difference to only be present on the market or form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logo called because of family "Big Blue" has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product width - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM holds the most patents and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most well-known inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes, or diskettes.
With about 220 billion dollars of market value (market capitalization), IBM was the second largest technology company this year (just after Apple), with Microsoft being overtaken for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of today's customers - unfortunate for example were the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you can't get emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they don't work, leaving them again.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
IBM's profits are largely accounted for by services, software and hardware, each accounting for one fifth.
In 1990 hardware was still the most represented with a more than fifty percent share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-disposal assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
In these investments IBM continues after 2008 when the modern financial crisis swept the world for the first time like a storm.
Here, too, IBM remained loyal to the legacy of its first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment volume in the midst of the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM has survived today's crisis without prejudice.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008, and the company's net profit continues to grow.
IBM's corporate slogan is: everything can be changed - just not the values.
This is also why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also master the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutters to spaceflights
Founded a hundred years ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for the later IBM company was the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technologies such as the famous clocks for the registration of the start and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also Chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
This leader then even eclipsed the founders of IBM - based on Watson's ideas to this day the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production and distribution of all possible machines for trade - from sausage and cheese cutters, to cash registers.
In the first four decades in which Watson ran the company, he doubled its revenues to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the executive chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM helped NASA direct flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which determined the computer standard of that time, came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant part of the PricewaterhouseCoopers company and thus entered fully into the consulting services and services business with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the last three years is the "Smarter Planet" concept.
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned so far, e.g. to improve the situation in transport and in city management.
In the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the Smart Commerce platform to help traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932 IBM founded a branch in the then Czechoslovakia - the first country in Central and Eastern Europe at all.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe are located in Prague and here is also a top research team of world level that deals with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová on her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become their lover by the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the further life it has set itself clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová had offered the singer I. Bartošová refuge in her own house, she wouldn't even have dreamed of how this would end with her husband.
When Iveta left after 30 days at her urging, Josef went with him.
Yes, he even publicly confessed that he loved her.
In time Darina resigned, even it seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář Iveta should leave Bartošová in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to end his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, strayed old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have certain ties," said Mrs Rychtářová; but she also said that she had already separated emotionally from him and insisted on mutual decency alone.
Joseph wears the fact that Darina has locked the back door for him with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues to run, I take care of repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"I have a normal conversation with Darina, we just don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he does not want to stop her.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I realize that's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take over any responsibility.
The worst female abusers: what about you?
If you ask the men to name some typical female abusers, they shake some promptly out of their sleeves without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself again in the following lines, in which we let pass a few immoral revues, which let the men flow the blood in the veins?
Shopping addiction
Is their husband accusing them of being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one haber weekly?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a little bit more in action?
Then I guess your case is really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping lust under control.
But hand on heart, which woman can already take it, in the search for a well-fitting outerwear only so to stroll through a clothes store and not to try out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even if shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Why don't you think about how many times they told her husband you'd better stay outside...
Permanent discontent
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would have to lose at least five pounds - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do you even like me?"
Does that sound familiar to you?
Yeah?
I guess you're one of those women who's really obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn't mean you're supposed to let go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife is constantly complaining about their looks.
The stronger gender is in agreement - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are becoming more and more incompatible.
Order and cleanliness first
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - and do so at least twice a week.
Do you scold with your partner because he tramples on the clean tiles again with dirty shoes, you scolded the children, because the just scrubbed sink is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet has fingerprints again, where polishing makes so much effort?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you must not exaggerate anything and that order and cleanliness in family life are not the top priority.
In the end, this excessive sense of purity can also harm mutual relationships and, above all, family peace.
Chickens
"Dirty gym pants come in the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put those old socks on again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, don't be surprised that this will put him on the palm tree.
Of course that's not bad, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not have had to complain so much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to clap and gossip, because behind their backs is cuddled or even slandered or alliances are forged.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to go through issues like - who, where, with whom, how and why.
I think each of us women has a little harmless gossip and gossip in store.
Hand on your heart - this is probably all women's.
But this is not to be confused with gossipants of the grossest caliber, to whom nothing and no one is holy, who despise everyone in their surroundings and which pose a considerable danger, especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
Jaromír Jágr had a large share of the Philadelphia 5–3 victory on the Carolina ice in the NHL's Monday game with two assists, making him the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The benefit of the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star was Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was named the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's fellow player Jakub Voráček.
Jágr claimed after the match to journalists that he had predicted Giroux a great evening.
"Even before the game, I'll tell him he's doing a hat-trick today."
I felt that kind of way."
"In and out of such a feeling," explained Jágr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal at the Flyers' first shot.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráček won the puck behind the Hurricanes' goal and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first third was knocked off, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short hand, but the second third then belonged to the Flyers again.
More specifically, Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jágr praised his center.
"I wouldn't have thought of playing with an ice hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"I'm so happy."
"I'm cutting my game towards me."
"All the years in the NHL, my fellow players set their game on me and now the pike turns around," Jágr grinted.
Carolina made play another drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who prevailed from a penalty shot, it came up to a goal.
However, Matt Read prevented any further complication in which he was successful in excess of two against one.
"Excellently, Pronger was still operating in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I picked up drive and (Read) moved to more distant post."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked," Voráček described the game's last hit from his point of view.
Through this victory, Philadelphia placed itself at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defence player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured Buffalo in the match and retired in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
The Candiens also lost their lead in Penalty shooting 2:3 in addition to their Beck.
One of the penalty shots Tomáš Plekanec could not turn.
More than the lost points probably hurt the coach of the home team the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only with five defense players to the end.
"That's bad."
"We only finished the encounter with a single experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing we can do, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"With each change one attack wave after another and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."
There were reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defensive players.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec prevented thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5–2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters had a share.
Travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five approved state travel agencies in the then ČSSR: Čedok, sportsurist, CKM, Recrea and autoturist.
At that time, the travel agencies sold mainly only trips to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, to the West at that time only selected ones were allowed.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A clear exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore the journeys to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even the citizens of the Eastern Bloc (i.e. the Czechoslovaks) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
If, for example, a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual trips were not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies offered trips to the West, but then one had to accept huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
This was not the way things were going.
The so-called foreign exchange pledge - the condition for a departure to the West - was given only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to raise the necessary funds (Western currency) for a journey to the West without a foreign exchange commitment.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dapps - a habit that continues to this day.
A travel revolution of the Czechs followed the velvet revolution of 1989.
While a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad last year in countries around the world.
A huge paradox that one is no longer aware of today is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular holiday country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, foreign exchange obligations were abolished in neighbouring Western European countries, resulting in a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks simply could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
For example, the Czech vacationers slept in the tent in the park while travelling to Paris, because who would have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension at that time.
A typical feature of Czech trips abroad was a trunk packed with canned food, beer and sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to purchase the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and thus also the average salaries increased, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, after 1997, travel agencies began to prepare regularly for travel by charter flights, which made air travel incredibly cheaper compared to the past thanks to the possibility of negotiating volume discounts.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the US, already had unvised payments with all the world's highly developed countries, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-official" travel came in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was handled - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying to far-off sunny countries every year; this year, twelve exotic destinations are flying directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 thousand Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the most advanced countries in the world.
For the first time in 2008, the Czechs spent more than half their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than CZK 15 thousand per capita for a single holiday stay, including the costs at the resort.
The general meeting is to find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has no chairman, and the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) is not even known after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there has been no agreement on which electoral order should be elected.
And without this, no vote is possible at all on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his role, calling on his colleagues to resign to agree and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old alternations between the two chambers of association broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear and clear on 16 September, when the new chairman was to be chosen.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting had come to the People's House in the Prague district of Smíchov for nothing, because the negotiations did not result and it was not just about the election itself.
We could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full assembly - only the statutory representatives or also the officials with a mandate.
This is the only point on which agreement has been reached, at least in part, to which the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law has contributed, the opinion of which is that representation on a proxy basis is not permissible.
However, the dispute over the electoral order continues.
Nor did the Executive Committee bring any more clarity into the matter, the meetings of which, no matter whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle have nothing else on the agenda at all.
Even though the views on the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how should one proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a stalemate situation?
"The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or whether a completely different model needs to be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of FAČR, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
Moravia is reportedly willing to respond to the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, on the other hand, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage counting.
"Then the two preliminary rounds no longer have any sense at all, this mode would question the entire bicameral concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would be best not to bend the electoral order, but to choose according to valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees, even though it appears that the statutory electoral order is most likely to meet Pelta from all candidates.
"My wish is to be largely elected according to the statutes."
"So that no absurd substitutes are devised, as at the last general meeting," stated the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who ran for the first time and distinguished himself from Pelta in his statements.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively together in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European Football Championship today would certainly contribute to calming the spirits."
"If football is only riding on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to work together is also greater," says the official from Jablonec, who has the greatest experience of all three adepts, both on a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is ambivalent."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "justify" the regulations for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a further blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that common sense will ultimately win," said Rajchl.
Only - there is not much time left for all sides to agree.
Some negotiations should supposedly take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generality will be complete by the qualifying match.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, among others, were supposed to fly to Podgorice, could not start in the morning in Prague because of a technical malfunction and so one was feverishly looking for a replacement variant, as one still brings part of the executive committee to the location of the barrage-hinspiel.
Finally, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday, is crucial.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to have moved the divided parties within the largest sports association in the country to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the trustworthiness of Czech football and the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will point the Czech sport in a new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into the fight for the position of chairman because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, head of the Pilsner footballers, could have made up a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have entered the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and renounce the election."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favourite of the election, Pelta, from getting to the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that, in the event of his victory, he intends to serve as chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to have seen an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
"I spoke to some of the people in question in person."
"It's hard to believe that some told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly interferes with Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Federation Roman Berbr, a man of controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For Paclík, for this reason, it is unacceptable that Pelta should hold the chair's position.
"With his victory, today's state would be preserved and Czech football would not go forward at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be twice as bad for football," said Paclík.
Hereby he also alludes to the fact that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone interceptions to investigate in a corruption affair, from which Pelta emerged without penalty.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to (tsch.) football."
"And how would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who saw his earlier saying that "he would sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta became chairman," but he saw something more relaxed.
However, if Paclík were to win in the Thursday election, he could well imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
The same is true of another candidate - Rajchl, whom Paclík had supported before the October general meeting, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great skills".
"I could well imagine him as head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he's capable of running the association as manager."
"I'm not stuck in matters I don't understand," said Paclík, who had caused a stir in September by replacing Dagmar Damková, who was behind the resignation of the referee commission with Luák Macela.
Paclík himself claims that he feels that he is up to the role of president of the association.
And he relies on his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer he is also head of Pilsen, which with his support celebrated the first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football milieu and contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups who tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which degenerates into disgusting situations," said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy, for example, to Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský.
One of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders for more money flowing from the lottery tax to sport.
"This is one of the crucial things the new chairman should devote himself to".
"When it comes to taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their reasoning, but they also have to say clearly where the money is going," he said.
Paclík does not see his connection to the Pilsner club as a handicap either, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FAČR must be "non-partisan".
Pelta, on the other hand, is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"I don't think it makes much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third party in a hypocritical way in order to return after a year and a half," Paclík made clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which in future ruled out a patt situation.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the chairmanship, Miroslav Pelta, promised that, in the event of his election, he would campaign for the FAČR to be given new statutes that would rule out disputes about the electoral rules in the future.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly defuse in the event of a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would concentrate on the national team and the raising of funds in the event of his election.
He only decided at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting and so the two-month break might help him to defend his ideas about the management of football and to present it in a broader context.
"People at all levels devote themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association was run by someone, says the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonecer club, but who also acted for many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
This is also why he believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hašek is responsible for today's problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, statutes were approved at the June Annual General Meeting, which were not as perfect as all had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September," said Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the citizens' association that he used as a means of attracting the delegates.
"If I should become chairman, I will take this personally and be willing to bear personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
"This is a matter of principle that he cannot be without," says Pelta.
Furthermore, he does not try to distinguish himself from his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he acknowledges because of his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, which in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football, it has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"His attacks, however, were deplorable and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That's why many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed to his opponent, who probably remains true to his proclamations, which he already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is knowledge of football from the lowest classes of the game to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all affairs - from the causa bohemians, to the aftermath of the corruption scandal of last year."
"Right after that, I would rush to negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for all football," said the forty-six-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean staff cleaning.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said towards Strahov, where the long anarchy makes me understand that there is nervousness.
Despite the disastrous catastrophic scenarios accompanying the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If really the only controversial point should be how to vote in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"Soccer needs credibility, and it will only win it back if it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the potentially decisive day of his working career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will begin to work hard under him
If the former vice-chairman Jindřich Rajchl was elected as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would supposedly spoil the mood of many people in the Association.
Rajchl promises that if he chooses, he will start working hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football, and otherwise continue the work begun by previous chairman Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I want to devote myself to football as a whole."
From international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, professional football, to performance football for youth."
"I don't mean to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in a conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and I therefore want to distribute the competences in the executive committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that football progresses in every segment with mile steps."
Many would not be delighted about this, because instead of criticizing others, they would have to start working really hard themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he had considered not to run at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are standing behind me who don't constantly throw clubs between my legs and question every step I make," he said as an explanation of why he hesitated.
"But many people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise others would."
"That's trust you can't lose," he said.
Supposedly, he also motivates him to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we've done a lot of work and I don't want to throw that away."
"Procedures have been launched that will probably only come into effect in a few years, and I would hate to see them stop someone," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't do."
"Behind him are above all people who would make football so that it would only be there for the chosen."
I may be blamed for a few things, but not for being partial."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone is doing well and not just the chosen one," Rajchl noted.
He also disagrees with the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which then each went up to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a particular problem for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Because the head of Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík has now joined the struggle for the role of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances that he will be elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-chairman and now realizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the saving of tens of millions of kroner for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he blames himself in part for the fact that the bandage does not pull in a single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to give Czech football new confidence", he considers the second rival - Paclík a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"Should he be elected, he would probably continue to do the things Ivan Hašek has initiated and would obviously not fundamentally change the staffing of the commissions."
He would certainly not want to bend things in his favor," Rajchl judges over his rival.
Europe’s most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Paddling pool in UFO-Optik, Punkpools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike the tired legs in bubble baths rest.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip for the past one and a half years, one thing was not to be missed in her luggage: her bathing suit.
Rugging on the water, she gazed high in artfully designed domes, she swam towards marble putts waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
If she liked a bath, she took it up in her notebook - with interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architecture historian Meder in this way - and now presents her in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She led her "trip to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe" through 13 countries: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
She doesn't have much to do with sports, says Meder - it's just different in the water.
Only annoying that swimming fans have to settle down with blue tiles and chlorination tanks, while joggers can inhale the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful bird chirping in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Vienna-based Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Splaetzer in the diving pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builders have tried hard, swimming halls can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in baths."
"On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format picture book "Badefreuden" provides information on the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness havens on 190 pages - but above all makes you want to jump into the blue.
Notable specimens were discovered by pool collector Meder in her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found a nitrate-containing water in a quaint karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: while the Züricher Dachbad has the whole city in mind, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can observe the hustle and bustle on the ski slope.
The most unusual pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three bowls open upwards it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector Meder rose the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so strongly of fuel oil that one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing medicinal water, which is almost black and whose slick sticks to your skin as soon as you slip into the pelvis - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places: When she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a closed terrain.
The bathroom, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
When Meder took a look through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, one has counteracted the decay in an enchanting swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction have already passed through this bath; one can discover not only neo-Roman elements dating from the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - not only because it was originally from the Black Forest.
"It's an achievement to merge different architectural styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural Speculation
Deutsche Bank to Investigate Raw Material Business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the Group CEO then wants to draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
For the German people, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions step out of this business because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges drive prices up - and the banks therefore bear a complicity in the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protection is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank boss Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to hedge traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled themselves from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to examine the allegations and said that no business was "worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit is to be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Board of Management of Deutsche Bank - including a recommendation on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the head of the bank then wants to tell the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann tinkers with his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how recklessly banks today are damaging the general good."
As the top bank lobbyist, Ackermann is now particularly committed.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio that use money for betting on food prices," Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is about people suffering from hunger or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann comes at first glance as a surprise, but it is clear that the Group CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before leaving office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Chief Executive Officer would not change to the Supervisory Board, unlike planned.
With a move away from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible losses, he hardly needs to worry - that would eventually have to do with his successor.
Any second would terminate raw material plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute Forsa surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Just eleven percent therefore consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities that bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences when they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: According to the survey, one in two would terminate all investments where money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances against such a bank, 49 percent said thinking about quitting their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with highs, lows and happy ending: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and disappeared.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
If modern post-war architecture is enthralled by clear shapes, glass halls, bold turns and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwacker is an apt and famous example of the 1958 World Exhibition in Brüssler.
At the time, Dicker's pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built Austria's pavilion at the next World's Fair.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus a bowl-like extension in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, was set up in the Swiss Garden near the Vienna South Railway Station after the World Exhibition, rebuilt and opened a museum of the 20th century in 1962 - the "20er Haus" was called it.
However, the building was neither spatial nor technical as a museum - no walls to hang the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art got a new house in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called the "21er Haus" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere in 2007, has completed the new start.
Husslein-Arco, an art historian with a remarkable career, among other things, in his youth as an figure skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, implemented the transformation strongly among politicians and conservationists, procured public funds and private sponsorship funds and determined the use.
Besides contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and a bookstore should be there, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the execution then Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna with Schwecker and the pavilion was a "unfortunately important place" for him, where he had watched the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost in generosity and ease when he moved to Vienna and its conversion.
With the current reconstruction, there were far greater problems: the building was "an energy hurler," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass-fiber-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two basements brought space for the new use, a lowered light ditch between house and street provides for the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red-brown rust protection color.
And the cinema room is still exactly the same as it used to be.
And all under strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the Heritage Office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and modifications, the building has remained flexible and lightweight.
It had been difficult with the pavilion "which came from Brussels", Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and nevertheless wants to "awaken a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21er Haus is not in the wrong place, because there has been a lucky urban development case: Around the Swiss garden, the completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential buildings, is being created.
And another stroke of luck may still occur: The 21er Haus could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and as you can hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighbourly location in the Swiss Garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package in millions
The railway has worked out a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
According to a newspaper report, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year in the fight against train failures and delays caused by winter.
The "Image" newspaper reported in advance on the basis of an intra-group crisis plan that investments of a total of around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
The aim was to improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks, even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, a doubling of internal and external employees for the removal of snow on railway systems and platforms to 16,000 people is planned.
The aim is to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary turnouts.
Two months ago, railway chief Rüdiger Grube had warned about train failures and delays after a top meeting with government and industry this winter.
Last winter, the railways had considerable problems in passenger transport, as they lacked reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been working for years to ensure that it has to have axles of ICE trains tested much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE in Cologne's central station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank Pays Millions’ Penalty in the USA
After the tumult around chief Josef Ackermann, new evil comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million dollars there.
As if the problems at home for Deutsche Bank were not enough, the industry giants are now also catching up with their past in the USA: The Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of large banks of leading cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they have played down the risks.
During the financial crisis, such papers lost a lot of value and dragged the banks into the depths.
"We are pleased that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank spokesman in New York.
The bank admitted no guilt with the settlement.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed to paying $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the courtesy of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is in charge of the US cooperative banks and intervenes in bankruptcies to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get compensation for the billions of dollars of damage.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also taken on other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on house loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became the doom of a large number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank overturned Lehman Brothers.
Even though events have been going on for a few years, banks in the US are currently facing a sharp wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have tried countless lawsuits to get redress or to punish misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of overprivileging two U.S. state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage deals worth around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a lawsuit by FHFA, which deals with several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurters stand for "substantial losses", without, however, mentioning an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett rises at 10 billion at IBM
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the major American investor Warren Buffett had always stated that he would not invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies could not be predicted.
However, he had now read IBM's annual reports and changed his mind about investments in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily providing services and computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered to be a knight in the financial world.
As a result, IBM is now allowed to call itself "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett has now revealed in the US business channel CNBC that he has been buying $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known anything about the engagement so far.
He praised the management, which even in the economic crisis had still ensured proper profits.
"They did a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had tended to avoid technology companies so far.
He says he invests only in companies he understands their business.
Instead, Buffett accessed a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builder.
In addition to around 80 own subsidiaries, its Berkshire Hathaway holding also owns shares in a number of major corporations such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and developed it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with clever investments.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors all over the world.
His almost unmistakeable sense of making money has earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After becoming aware of the Buffett investment, IBM's share pre-emptively increased by one percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also known, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the world's most valuable technology companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now reviving.
The murders of eight Turkish-born and one Greek small entrepreneur from 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is addressed with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, this has resulted in the return of a ghost that has long been believed dead: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks.
Nevertheless, the fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the revealed right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from predictable.
"Is the bloody ideology revived?" headlined the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators is said to have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities may also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany reacted calmly: on the weekend, it reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, the togetherness had been staged - as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media seems like a slap in the face: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the title of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haver X", which talks about the background of the murder series.
Nor can the German edition of the "Hürriyet" be taken away from drawing this mental connection.
"It starts to stink," is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that people had been murdered who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
The procedure of the police and their subsequent search success are discussed extremely critically in German Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not think of looking for suspects in right-wing extremist circles much earlier.
Some people are at least rhetorically prepared for drastic means: "If there is any further embarrassment here, the migrants have no choice but self-defense and arming."
"This will probably be the best self-protection".
"Internal peace in Germany depends very much on the goodness of enlightenment and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network," writes Selen.
The attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s illustrated what it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the sense of self on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was particularly criticised: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack of Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President, but at the funeral ceremony in Cologne, he was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel recorded in his speech at the time how many contributions the local Turks made.
Quite as if the value of a person is calculated by the amount of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been since then.
In addition to the efforts to clarify and re-evaluate far-right terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The scandal bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now let a German judge it.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take up an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss major bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was pleased publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly gained solidity and dropped friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But already in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A UBS dealer in London had bypassed all of the bank's security systems and gambled around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, UBS Chairman of the Board of Directors has also been seen as having been downgraded - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally arrive?
It was already announced that Weber would be able to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the Board of Directors already in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's gonna be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, he is a professor of economics and a central banker and would certainly have had to be trained.
With one blow, he then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven once again that it has long since earned the title of "Europe's largest scandal bank".
On the one hand, UBS is huge - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and, on the other hand, has been squeezing from scandal to scandal for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She had combined the image of the secretive and solid, but also outsourced Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very big number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed more money-rich customers than any other bank in the world with $1.6 trillion.
On the other hand, as an investment bank, it had advanced to the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-time bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger explains: "At that time, I always presented UBS as a model of a good bank for my students."
"From today's point of view, how could I be so wrong?"
He was wrong a lot.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something went wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who until then was regarded as a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker.
A few months later, they suspected why he had left.
The bank's investment division had gambled with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To shoulder this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs.
For this she actually found investors, however, which some until shortly before would have bludgeoned: an intransparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund, which was so silent that one did not even know its name.
But that was just the first blow.
It got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, Switzerland's second-best-paid Board of Directors in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster ensued: the UBS faced collapse in view of its misinvestment in the financial crisis and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank bought UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, which allowed it to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of UBS in 2007 was more than five times the size of Switzerland's economic performance (see chart).
"Once again, we could not save UBS," says bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second disaster.
Just a few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who might have been behind taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it agreed to a $780 million payment - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including a fine.
In doing so, UBS more or less openly acknowledged that it had helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Within a few months, the bank had lost credibility in both core business areas: in investment banking through misspeculation and in asset management through aid to tax evasion.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just as you thought, now the UBS will get it done again, then follows this miserable dealer story: A single dealer gambles 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it turns out that risk management in investment banking is obviously still not working.
"With the Adoboli case, it has been found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the University of Zurich's Bank Institute.
The CFO of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with UBS is that it has no control over risk control."
But it was precisely the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago started to become guardians of the great wealth of the world: no too great risks, for security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic the world might once collapse.
The vaults of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank - it's just a bit bigger.
The location is already classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception room of UBS is accessed through a heavy rotating door.
Inside, the walls are marble-clad, in front of them are thick leather armchairs, next to the bench logo a large sign for the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
Both Swiss major banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but eventually displaced this idea of the Swiss bank - or reveal how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds it.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two major banks.
The UBS had become much too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say there.
"And if they do, they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it high profits, and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss major bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"That Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided the greatest rescue action in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or around 45 billion euros, were granted by politicians to save the large bank that was facing bankruptcy.
How could it happen?
Speaking to Swiss bankers, they see the problem above all in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss major banks joined forces to form a huge group.
A bank was created that was already too large for small Switzerland during the merger - and grew ever further.
It helped the two different predecessor banks of UBS to complement each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalised bank.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers got a lot of money to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high intellectual, modest, who understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the bellyman, who has worked up from the bank theory to the very top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear, exuberance came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the management meetings, on which Group CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: Goldman Sachs pushes off the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on earth.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go, to the top.
A few steps were already successful.
She was at the top of the list in foreign exchange and stock trading.
However, management consultants who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: in international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there was a huge gap with the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime investments.
It developed into a huge machine that packaged and passed securities on to American mortgage loans - but also retained risks itself.
Even when other banks long ago sought exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to go when the attempts to clean up turned out to be more difficult than thought.
Positions at UBS became the ejection seat and are shaky to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all of its obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: end to investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is expected to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has prevailed: he is supposed to run UBS's business on a permanent basis, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to its mid-1990s level.
He'll strike 3500 places.
That won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber will surely be asking himself now.
So far, he has only publicly said that he will look for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of Recession in Europe Harms US Stock Exchange
The impending recession in Europe has taken the courage of US investors to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without force.
The reduced industrial production on the continent suffocated the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the bud.
The general relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass last week was still considered half full, not half empty - but now the problems came to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all financial values were on the sales notes.
The Dow Jones index of default values at the close of trading was 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer fluctuated between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The broader S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange index lost 0.8 percent and went out of trading with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax passed with a minus of 1.2 percent with 5985 counters.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced production and is preparing for the end of the upswing.
Businesses produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, as reported by Eurostat.
The US investors were skeptical about this: "We're not an island, we're dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe would not be able to get rid of a recession so quickly, and there were further signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do anything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why, in his view, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade-old principle over the pile and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the stock price of the traditional group and had it listed at first just under one percent higher against the trend in the course of trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of 170 dollars per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of its investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
At 2.6 percent, shares of Bank of America declined significantly more than the market.
The house silvers almost the entire rest of its shares in the China Construction Bank and pays $6,6 billion for it.
With the net profit from the business, the institution primarily wants to cushion its capital ratio and thus meet tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The share won 1.5 percent after the Group collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 Type 777 long-haul aircraft on Sunday and valued the order at $18 billion.
Including options on 20 other machines, the volume amounts to as much as $26 billion.
On the New York Stock Exchange, approximately 710 million shares changed ownership.
719 values increased, 2281 decreased and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares increased by 630, in 1913 by minus and in 82.
Smart crows spread in cities
In many places seed crows are regarded as "problem birds": But the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, experts claim.
Some like it, others want to get rid of it very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities local residents' complaints about the dirt and noise of animals are piled up.
A remedy against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crows can no longer be retrieved from the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian void.
There, experts from all over Germany discussed possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Nature conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the rural exodus of the particularly protected seed crows: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, growing cultivation, and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for birds.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs exist in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the district had caused negative headlines.
Critics had described the capture of animals in bird traps and the killing with clubs as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the excavation, does nothing," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer noted.
Spraying away nests with water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals escape, large colonies split up and spread elsewhere."
It is only possible to bury them as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is conceivable that a combination of animal burials from sensitive living areas and lock offers could be used to resettle them in other places.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens advocated "information boards instead of chain saws" for an entirely different way of dealing with the animals: "After all, we can best bear a pimple on the face confidently."
Jürgens had co-founded the Aschenberger Krähen educational trail in Schleswig-Holstein, where signs inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project is already being accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the birds' noise: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed crows not only use tools to get a treat, but even produce their own tools as aids.
Behavioural researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested on four seed crows how far the intelligence of the birds reaches.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to use stones to bring a scaffold to collapse in order to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determined what size and shape a stone must have in order to cause the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt, the clever crows had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larve.
With the beak the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid down pieces of wire for them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket on the handle out of the tube.
Three of the four seed crows managed to do so immediately.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to the European Championship 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup failed.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland are present at the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by the double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd) Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect the fifth consecutive EC participation after the 0–0 out of the in-game.
The Czechs reached a 1–0 (0–0) in the play-off game against outsiders Montenegro, after the in-game (2–0) had already been a clear thing.
Croatia did not burn any more in the 0–0 against Turkey, Ireland brought a loose 1:1 (1–0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other hits for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trade meter (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa against Portugal.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal caught a custom start.
Ronaldo chased a free kick from about 30 meters to the early lead into the stitches.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his long shot qualities and hit the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance through goal hunter Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburg from the English league leader Manchester City put a headball on the lower edge of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Afterwards, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was the focus.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic surely transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 runner-up made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time in a row that the European Champion of 1976 has won the European Championship.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to survive a fright second already in the initial phase.
Finalist Petr Cech prevented a possible goal by Tomas Sivok (9th) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the spin from the penalty zone limit just barely past the goal of Cech.
After the break, the cross bar had to save for the Czechs' already beaten world-class goalkeeper, again the striker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50th).
The gate just before the end finally made everything clear.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0–3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond a 0–0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to clear his place on the bench of the World Cup third of 2002, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in an EM final round.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan only hit the post in the seventh minute with a distance shot, assailant Kazim Kazim was also unable to sink the bouncer into the goal.
After the moment of terror, however, Croatia took over more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made way for the Dortmund Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bavaria Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in action.
Trapattoni goes to EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first EM participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision in the 32nd minute with 4–0 success in the in-game.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) paid for the guests.
Ireland pushed up the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment the Estonian back team prevented the possible lead hit.
But in the 32nd minute it was time.
After an accident by finisher Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball to the 1-0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer, SAP, is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around two billion dollars (around 1.5 billion euros) will flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and recruit employees accordingly," co-chief Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
SAP is currently present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the world's more than 176 000 SAP customers are located in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP plans to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers had redeemed around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is running almost rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott explained.
"Our goal is to support sustainable growth in China through comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Terror. A story of the First World War, narrated in nineteen destinies" begins with a long list of main characters that goes to your heart.
Here is a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will know these people very well in Englund's romantic narrative, and these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in those few moments when you, like Englund's men and women, are lost in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not misdescribe as "a work of anti-history".
It contains few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's not a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about what it was like." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and terror" almost coincides with the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, become mad or die.
Each of these lives flickers up like the votive candles in a church, some are added while others are extinguished.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war of position on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Terror" wanders with expert views over other war sites: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall bee baskets, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is almost a moving book from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina, which smells like cordite.
Imagine you're a woman who's at home with her children, listening to gunfire in the distance.
Who's coming, anyway?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Failing facts," says Englund, "have been poised with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and terror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailor.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be terrifying or poignant, but they are extremely alive in Englund's collection of small moments lost in details.
Many of them are talking about lack and helping themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, replacement everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the replacement dinner in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and last served with a fake bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes lined with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to savagery and says about the war: "You feel that despite everything that was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in your hand, and pretending to mean such a facade civilization and as if there was no barbarism behind your own strengthened and foggy shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die and no one will take notice of it or take care of it.
"If you refrain from the idea of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a convicted man who has been hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that falls apart, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict increasingly became an economic contest," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in a tailor-made suit, slaughtering while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways and there are as frivolous behavior as Heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect a prostitute with a venereal disease in order to escape frontal service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonococcal pus, because soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital like this," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, resulting in them being blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes smooth and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "uncontrollable forces unleashed in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People begin to wonder why their leaders make them fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly rather falsified like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West nothing new" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read about in a nonfiction book.
I'm not giving it back.
But it's like with his book, he got us off this page with the main characters in front of us and lit it with a match.
After an early misstep, a minute planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
They had chosen the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there were hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed, and everyone else initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was in the midst of them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and gave the squatters an enormous increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials stepped up the so-called chaos training - counter-terrorism measures, including the quick laying of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, which spoke of a declaration as "exercise."
"The few police officers involved, to my knowledge, did not know that it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then retreated when hundreds of protesters came together after they learned about these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in Tuesday's operation, including operations squads from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials normally deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day, many people in and out of the park, almost like commuters, so 1 a.m. at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do so if the least number of people were in the park," he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and speakers were standing by at the Pike Slip exit and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages roaring from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply gathered their things together and left the place.
Police said that by 1:45 a.m. no tents would be touched to give the protesters time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police president, said this had happened to their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they were trying to stop them from watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the officials' dealings were very rough.
Mr Browne said that television cars on Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved to the west through the big mess of personal belongings of protesters, including suitcases, artificial grass and bags with clothes, their employees followed the town cleaning, which picked up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main centre of protesters moved near the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park.
Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp tied up to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them loose.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 p.m.
According to police, the eviction was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests, as he said, were due to "improper conduct and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent local official was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the police department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not lead the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were supposed to access, a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were built on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, one block further south.
It could be observed how from these locations the police extended the perimeter further and further around Zuccotti Park.
In one place it was observed that several officials, many of them with protective signs, drove people outside.
Approximately 28 people were in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Trade union of the carers will file lawsuit against the city for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of school supervisors who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday as the dismissals are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on the schools teaching poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last opportunity left open for the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to undo dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school workers, care coordinators and other employees, who were among the worst paid employees in the city and had lost their jobs in a move on 7 October, described the union leaders as political revenge for refusing access to a health fund maintained by the working groups last year to close the household gap.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the city council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the redundancies were part of the budget, that they had passed in June.
A member of the city council fired back and told him that nothing in the budget specifically specified that staff members of the school aid would be dismissed.
City Council 37 officials said they had and warned the Ministry of Education about a lawsuit. On Wednesday there will be a press conference at which the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the city's Ministry of Education as defendants and eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson for the city's Ministry of Justice, said that the city did not have the lawsuit and thus their individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a bill of complaint submitted by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in the poor neighborhoods of the city to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment. It claims that poor schools have lost more helpers as they are chronically underfunded.
It states that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn have lost and 46 helpers in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx have been dismissed.
By finding the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: "This is not a neighborhood of bewitched parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th district's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and money was lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra funding for every poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of high schools were misled by the language in a memo authorising the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the plot, even if "excess" (translate German) in the US usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred," the draft complaint states.
Mission completed, Congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and the cessation of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's International Relations Committee will adopt a resolution under the leadership of Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and US troops for its "Mut".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of two parties' support for their democratic efforts."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, legislators from both parties and the White House argued about the choice of words of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the role of the U.S. military in NATO's Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising the restricted use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe group of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this law passed through the Senate, and the Chamber overruled a resolution to cut money for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission became a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress that, although upset enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, was not angry enough to pull the ground from under his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their enormous courage and exceptional endurance in their self-liberation" and " commends the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Board or will they divide the legislators, as the June Act did?
The final version encounters opposition from Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee's top Republican.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change calling for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every Congressional legislature of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or another area that is currently being voted in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have tried so far unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have tried often enough.
Goodlatte's amendment is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been submitted to this Congress, covering a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was submitted to both Congress and Senate - others differ only slightly.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensatory budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners in the Republicans who want to polish up their CVs - the opportunity to brag that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such a change.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to remove the limit on two presidential terms.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage among same-sexers is a recurring template, as is a change that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As eager as the members suggest changes, they move as unevenly faster than in recent years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators submitted 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Bound, but not defeated," said Giffords in the first television interview following the assassination attempt
Ten months after an armed man shot at her at close range during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night. She alone sang the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said the desire to recover was greater than the one to return to Congress.
When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she wrestled for words and needed help walking.
The broadcast showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet that split its skull, pierced the left side of its brain, and crossed its head from front to rear.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt brake.
In her first television interview following the January attack, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied, "Very good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special recorded shortly before the couple's new book was published: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The Special has been tracking Gifford's recovery since the 8 January assassination.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first weeks, she is seen in the hospital bed, with bald shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with the head.
A twitch with the lips.
And then, her first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: one sees the congressman singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and to Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours with therapy every day, said she couldn't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said that on March 12, he had read Giffords an article from a daily newspaper about the assassination when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
Suspicious shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a Missouri prison and is forcibly treated medically while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," Giffords Sawyer told.
"Hart, hard, hard."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly told Sawyer, she said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated?"," said Kelly.
You just got hit.
And you're gonna get through this, and you're gonna recover, and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel pity rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
At one cue, a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraiser in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, who was observed, among other things, by the Chief of Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really it wasn't.
The blatant contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are heaped with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, say servants.
The public is increasingly acting as if the people in uniform were hurting her.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way of support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in conflict with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that was inflicting on returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations take place about compassion in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there was a "annoying, violent veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over an elevated state post in Washington after his return.
During his search for work, he said, he felt that some of the surveyors subtly asked whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"If you speak about your ministry, you must hold the negative impressions against it," Cancian explained to his sons.
The military's lack of lightness is partly due to the Americans' lack of interest in the war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely taken out as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it was absolutely common in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is mostly focused on the suffering of a staff member.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in a rape before the military court.
If that does not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Chief Private Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer with her.
He asked her if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texan wiped away her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my gut."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously awaiting trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a lawsuit they have brought against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admitted to court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not take action against widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, filed by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially included 17 plaintiffs who, however, rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all claiming that they were raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, condemn or provide adequate jurisdiction after the alleged attacks.,
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, as the problem starts there.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individual persons who are in the position of eradicating the culture of retaliation? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February, she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors, many of whom may be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, so to speak, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by state attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss suit.
The court's files, which are available to Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or previous soldiers for injuries that have occurred in the armed forces.
Due to a 1950 Supreme Court law, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiffs' military service," the document states.
The Department of Defense refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the only difference lies in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with native women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to be modernized, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three other lawsuits are pending except hers.
At Yale Law School, Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for suspected promotion of an anti-women's atmosphere.
Independently, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America collects a lawsuit against the military focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that rape victims received to release them from service - a common approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration (the administration of the war veterans) in which she accused her discriminatory practices in her handling of benefit claims for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in service.
Nine laws were independently presented to Congress by a mix of senators and representatives of both parties, offering a number of clues.
According to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Ministry of Defense, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported in 2010.
However, most abuses are not reported at all and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases per year.
The report, published in March, also examines law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases recorded in the military were brought to justice, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole series of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, during which hearing she was asked about the sex she had before the attack with her boyfriend.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the suspected perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember well the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the labours would start. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric ward, and I remember when I came out, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who ultimately diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her unfit for duty.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably released, so she won't receive any support.
Whether the lawsuit that Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed is progressing is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first called into question.
I'm a critic of the Feres doctrine all my life.
The military is lagging behind a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and deterrent that a liability entails.
He adds, "The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the plaintiff's attorney, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms come about," she says.
Or until we die, whatever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who broadcast their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed an amok run in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is by far not alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time before his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on the side of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you only have to log in to Facebook.
"We have found that it wasn't difficult to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding of personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply need to use the page's advertising tool to accurately define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with add-ons, but instead of linking to a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking for their level of education, attitude to violence and assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 supporters of 14 highly right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office once.
"It's a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online supporters of far-right groups are mostly young, male and annoyed about immigration.
But in a sort of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends such as "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research boom that has increased the number of scientific work with the name of this page in the title by nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that through this page you can study people that you don't normally reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They first had to inform the party and it would never have allowed them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook, it's all gone - you're going straight to them."
Others say that the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues has found that students who discussed their full-blown on Facebook are significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who remained silent about this issue.
Moreno suggests that peer-reviewed students, such as residential consultants, monitor the site and help a student when posting too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle at the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children that would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook also constantly taps the data of its own population.
The page's data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and a National Lucky Index (mainly used data that only Facebook has access to - masters of digital freedom have long known that the page should make their large data resource accessible to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they want it or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to display its own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey that they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was all about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the data in a user profile and in contributions are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of the social - and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears in a public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who has confessed to two amok runs in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance in a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knight Templar of Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the laws, but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue as he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted confirmation that he was staying behind lock and key.
Everyone took part with the aim that everything was going to be closed down.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a little further after I have seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and seemed calm and professional throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre indication that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had had accomplices.
Some may like that the July 22 attacks were apparently the work of a single extremist, not a group of radicals.
But does that automatically ease the grief and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said a victim's relative.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the technique genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find most revealing in the recently re-discovered job interview, which was dusted this week before special film screenings on the important markets, is how much this creative head understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and self-appointed hippie, but he was also an meticulous organizer, eager to make diagrams - a man who believed that many managing directors suffer from "a disease of thinking", "that a really great idea makes 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph der Fach Idioten" about the departure of the personal computer. And he sat with Jobs for more than an hour, in which they had one of the rare, in-depth conversations.
At that time, when 10 years had passed since jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company, NeXT, and was looking forward to the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in professional idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing at the delivery.
It was only after Jobs' death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly reworked footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which will come to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for abhorring extensive interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly eager here to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatiently responding to Cringely's questions and prompts him to respond more quickly to topics or side acts of greater importance.
Prior to the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the Lost Interview seems somehow incredibly farsighted when Jobs evaluates what other companies do to his mind right or wrong and presents his own vision of the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read posthumous appreciations of career jobs'. But seeing jobs here as the eager dreamer who is on the leap to grandeur is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"During all the years in business, I always ask, "Why do you do things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues its efforts to streamline Apple accounting.
Astonished, how costs were recorded - usually started with "standard costs", which were calculated by mere assumption and which were then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest.
How the Pope was fooled:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could sneak into the telephone company and lead long-distance calls for free.
Much has already been written about the device, but job enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a chargeable phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another as they loop through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things around the globe half a dozen times, and when you got into the phone, it came out a minute later in the phone next door," says Jobs giggling.
"We were young and we learned that we can build ourselves something that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious prank that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called the Vatican in the middle of the night via Blue Box and wanted to talk to the Pope while they could as well imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"That had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever manufactured".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braun's tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for them.
How to Improve Innovations:
Several times in the interview Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he installed some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later on at Apple, he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember sweeping arguments...They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About large companies that are slowing down:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants with their visions came into stumbling and lost control of their stocks.
"Let's say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so you're making a better copier or printer, so what?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [they are such people] that ultimately run the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is required by the people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products, exterminated - craftsmanship.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the whole computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger if Microsoft could have been in the 1990s...
You've caught defeat from victory.
About Innovation as an Art Form:
"There is a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... if you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about your subtleties.
You have to make adjustments, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
In the end, it all boils down to the taste, it all boils down to trying to deal with the best stuff that humans have created, and then trying to bring these things together to what they do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shamelessly stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
Had it not been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws, as court case accepts
On the day that the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically dividing question of whether to hear a contest of President Obama's health laws, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, participated in a dinner sponsored by the firm that the case would be represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit that raised 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care that was passed last year by Congress, a law that became a catchword among conservative activists across the US.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour fundamental discussion is expected in March, which is probably the result of which will probably boost the 2012 presidential struggle, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer, who will stand in court and claim that the law is to be overturned, will probably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies supporting the Federalist Society's annual dinner, an old-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which contest the law.
Another sponsor was Pharmaciegigant Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had advised on the case at a Washington hotel.
Among others, Mitch McConnell, Republican leader in the Senate and a declared opponent of health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending federalist society events for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
Indeed, judges exempt themselves from the code of conduct governing the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in charity events law near and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms related to the case as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it was sufficient to alert moral and government activists.
"This astounding break with morality and the contrast to the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges lie, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the U.S...
"The judges won and dinnerd during a charity event with lawyers with pending court proceedings."
Their appearance and support of a fundraising campaign for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would mix court matters too easily with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the federalist society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a well-known conservative activist.
By contrast, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was Attorney General under the Obama administration when the first legal disputes came to court at first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from hearing the case for bias, as she was too committed to defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan does not make any institutions to do this.
Boeing pulls record order of 18 trillion dollars ashore
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 two-passenger aircraft with an option of 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It is really a rare news that a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products.
But it's a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft is a total of 18 trillion dollars.
The customer of Boeing is equally unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that Middle East airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest contract of all time for commercial aircraft on the weekend, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-speed Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also announced at the 2011 Dubai Aviation Show that it has an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, which will increase the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, ordered, which greatly improves the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar stock exchange specialist.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many of the Middle East's airlines are owned by the oil producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the aircraft, but an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so damaging, as the country earns from a higher oil price.
This is important as they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders as oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural protection," he said.
Emirates' appointment confirms Boeing's leading position in the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep Airbus' competitor SAS at bay, which is attacking dominance with the A350.
Boeing's victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the launch of the largest A350, which is competing directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more confidence after customers had demanded a higher payload and range.
Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers have supported opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for governor's post.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo from the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, won the race for the governor's post in the Western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday's day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the Sunday election.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... they have occupied poll booths, built road blocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled in Mexico for seven decades until they lost their presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the July presidential election.
Vallejo seems to have beaten Claderon only narrowly, who had still led in the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current incumbent governor, came in third place, a severe defeat for the split and unlucky left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still ongoing.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have left out of fear of the local elections.
For the PRI, victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan seem.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will make us look boldly into next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will curb the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, administrative director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must do "everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that look "unsufferingly" at the difficulties in Europe, saying that financial support from Asia to European leadership and resources helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he said to the Financial Times in an interview on the edge of the Mumbai World Economic Forum.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe’s monetary union has faced a severe debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe is fueling fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls for leading emerging economies to join forces to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - would provide greater bargaining power for European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its economy is now suffering from declining exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an assignment, because where else do we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies, such as India, have no incentive to help rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult politically to sell aid to 1.2 trillion people in India for Europe, more than 800 million of whom live from $2 or even less a day.
"Sometimes they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Executive Director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid civil servants in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railroad.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the eurozone will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The forecast of ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/ now threatens "the risk of gradation" due to the imminent danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant capital outflow of their vocabulary.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defense
Defense Minister Leon Panetta warmed up Congress on Monday, warning that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon's halls to the war venues in Afghanistan and civilian production lines.
The Pentagon is already pondering cuts of $450 trillion over the coming decade, but is now afraid that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will become necessary if Congress cannot reach a conclusion in spending.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating to the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said Congress' failure to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to so-called seizure, would result in 23% general cuts and a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a high cut, carried out in such a careless manner, would make most of our ship and construction projects impracticable - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the Senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from much of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with a certain probability to reach the target."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alert readiness."
The cuts were ultimately going to hit the fighting forces," said Panetta.
"While the wartime contingents in the anti-terrorism struggle are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
"Staff recruitments have been cut, leading to delays in hiring and hiring supervision that support the war."
"Staff salaries would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime traders and disruption of legal and political support."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for more details on the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Defense Department.
"The consequences of a Department of Defense seizure would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently against this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that should be imposed on us."
"Seizing is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings from the senators will increase pressure on a budget compromise or increase demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly outspoken the possible cuts, although he has gained many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a grim picture of what might be ahead - a military with a shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squadron without adequately trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," said Panetta in his opening address in the Pentagon.
"It's a force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to take it on with potential opponents."
"She actually makes you get angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global ability to deploy and respond, resulting in unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects of deletion could fall victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle that Army and Marine need to replace the Humvee.
If the further development and testing of the F35 were to be stopped, this would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but supporters say it is an important next step towards upgrading, so that possible dangers can be banished by China and other opponents.
How to expose a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy mastering the accusations of sexual harassment on the part of several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying.
Penn State's leadership is accused of perjury, as they have allegedly withheld reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself as he circulated denials that were quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations in campaign funding related to cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied during his second term at the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about cheating in school and college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers have given their students the exam answers so that they were good at their performance checks themselves.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that every day we lie between 10 and 200 times.
But many of these lies are regarded as a lie of necessity.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognising lies or "uncovering lies" is one that is important for everyone, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as Scharaden, in which the goal is to call "Have You!", demasking a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have carried out far-reaching research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been exposed.
Lies look you in the eye.
They stutter, stammer, blush, and do not always falter.
However, it cannot be concluded from this that these liars are difficult to discover and to expose.
A trained liar can penetrate to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing area of defiling. And it is clear that defiling a deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us to find justice in our complex world, especially when hiring or questioning persons or negotiations or administration is one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people, raising their interest and mastering their own emotions, and they intuitively feel how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people that men are more often "self-directed" lies than women whose lies are more "orientated" - as a rule, they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie less frequently to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when a person is exposed as an evildoer, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
It's called "baselining," the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent assessment of changes.
Watch the posture, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
You should better know when someone usually keeps jumping with the foot, so they don't blame him wrongly when he's tripping with the foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Think of these accumulations as alarm bells that shrill, not as proof of a disguise.
People who deceive may freeze when they try to remember their story. Maybe their feet point towards the door or they lean toward the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the interview", this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in posture when all the hard questions are over.
Questioners often falsely signal that an interview is over just to look for this relaxation after the interview.
Also pay attention to the language of your subject.
The slip of Scott Peterson is famous when he used the past form when he claimed his killed wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Disappointing people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if one repeats a tricky question in the whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than objective, which often makes the alarm bells shrill.
There is no magic tool to expose lies, but you can learn skills that allow for demasking.
These skills make it easier for anyone to become a victim of fraud, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after danger due to delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned Canada oil pipeline into the Gulf of Mexico, which angered the unions and at the same time reassured environmentalists, the pipeline building companies are trying to re-plan the project so that they can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament Building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This was the case after an announcement by the Foreign Ministry last week that a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course had been reviewed, which avoided the area of the sandhills in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the State Department and pledged his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline will connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta Province to Texas refineries.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators Nebraskas, who are against the plan, weigh the laws to force a turn away from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project has little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy states that the Ministry's main auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused as she allegedly forced an infant out of fear to vomit
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle, in the lobby of her Manhattan building, had a bloating attack that would have frightened her little daughter so much that she vomited in fear.
The Tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she was suffering from "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to set off for a family outing.
While Kevin Monk fetched the car, Roseanna Monk walked with her luggage and Genevieve on his arm into the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped off her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arms," she said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman furiously.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't put your daughter near the door," Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and started to scold - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to tip water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle rushed onto the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be restrained by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby screamed so much that it had to vomit, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls requesting an opinion.
The lawsuit is for unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he would not charge a fee and plan the family, the money she gets, that will donate child cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is exposed to a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climatic adversity slowed down the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and undeclared work rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of the change and fostered great hopes for economic growth, is in government. However, due to climatic adversity, growth cannot be mentioned, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators worsened.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses of millions in agriculture, but also narrowed the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first quarter of the year.This is mainly due to the historic decline in agricultural development of 31.16 percent, which slowed down further economic sectors.
According to a report published by Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582 000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, 78.03 percent of which were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity up to November has caused unemployment to rise steadily in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, as from January to March 55,053 inhabitants of Sinaloa had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53% of the labour force. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28% and from July to September to 6.19%, resulting in 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa, which is 18,969 more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa in the year goes back to several factors. Economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments that the politics of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, liquidity losses in the market as a result of the cutbacks in funding from legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who are illegally accumulating dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them, or use them for anything else," he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased, due on the one hand to the problems of entry and, on the other hand, because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here looking for work here, which causes unemployment to rise," he says.
undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if the high proportion of undeclared work is taken into account. According to INEGI, this includes 60.38 percent of the employees working in the country without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work come from low wages, the lowest in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Agency for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of employees in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos by September, much less than the general government average of 7375 pesos.
Decrease in FDI
In addition to reducing economic activity and increasing unemployment, the largest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the FDI amounted to $630,597 between January and June, corresponding to a decline of 87.74 percent compared to the $5 143,312 in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Agency for Economic Development) for its part recorded a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
In view of the economic crisis, in July the state government applied to the National Congress for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to reactivate the economy. The state congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive effects of debt on any of the country’s economic sectors could be identified by November.
Reactions
For the representatives of the entrepreneurship, the first year of government made Mario López Valdé's government incapacity obvious.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), argued that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"Economic activity in Sinaloa was really poor this year, and it needs to be worked hard to regain the terrain lost this year, and in 2012 we have to make a double effort. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the government team that has already been well tuned to each other, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López stated that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development more difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slowed economy that is not in motion enough to create an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will complete the year well below our expectations," he said.
Redefining appointment
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexico Business Association) in Sinaloa, said that it was necessary to make the state more productive.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There's a lot to do
The chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will guide the government's efforts in a better direction.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas where one can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The prosecution of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a public health offense - here the possession of marijuana intended for trade.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during the surveillance of Cipriano Valdez Street at guard No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and in the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the offender is still in the detention centre.
Debt for construction work
According to Miguel Ángel López Miranda, the social facilities for migrants provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes are in danger of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay.
The head of the Urban Social Development Authority stated that, although the construction programs are already advanced, they are now in danger, as the state government has not paid the funds allocated to them, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Until now, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the completion of the construction was to be expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, they haven't given us a penny, even though they would have had to pay us part already in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not fulfilled its obligations, so the municipality had to borrow 7 million at the beginning of its reign, which would correspond to the amount that the central government would have had to pay.
"We had already done so in the last parliamentary term, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued to run and this year we had to get the funds that the state had not raised to participate in these programmes," he said.
Although the public authorities were obliged to pay out these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance, , was requested to speed up administrative work and pay out the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"Almost 12 million have to contribute, and although the year is already coming to an end, they haven't given us a penny."
The court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico in 2015
The transition of analogue to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional actions filed by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the Presidential Decree, and by virtue of which the switching from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must be brought forward, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including Supreme Court President Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the legislative decree detailing the switchover to terrestrial digital television.
This resolution rejected the constitutional dispute created by the Senate because it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
In the project for the lawsuit prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed that the decree of law be declared unconstitutional, since the regulations relating to radio and television are the responsibility of the Comisión Federal de Telecommunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), which is why the decree of law would be contrary to hierarchical principles and the provisions of the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the decree of law. After the lawsuits were accepted, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the decree of law and ceased all activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the project, which was also the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the national government should not regulate the measures that the public administration should take under general rules.
"I don't think that if you did that, the independence of the regulatory body would be compromised." She also recalled that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it manages state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it causes better use of the radioelectric spectrum, an increased quality of signal and more channels.
The postponement of the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the exploitation of digitalisation, which was a decision in the public interest that had not only technical aspects, "because they encompass economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "made the action of the entire system necessary, according to the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of features that put the constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already implemented the digital transition, through the government, even though they had highly specialised facilities.
It could not be concluded that with the publication of the contested decree of law, the government intervened in the powers of Congress, because the laws adopted by the legislature were respected," she assured.
The possibility to count the ballots in Michoacán individually is being considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of counting the ballots individually this year is a reality at the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governorial elections is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November 9th the polling post adopted a series of rules to harmonise local rules with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, election law, or election justice law to the reforms adopted by Congress, so that they had not entered into force during this election round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the state scoreboard within the time limits set for that, arguing nor having objections to it.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional action filed by the local legislature and judged the State Commissioner's vote on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and unlawful", as he did not have the right to "decide or veto it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal, in an interview on the possibility of individual counting of votes, stated that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by Consejo General del IEM, there is now the possibility that the local electoral authority could count the ballots in part or in full.
Under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted.The results in the minutes do not agree; the minutes on the counting and calculation of votes are not available on the record, or are not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee, or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the fully filled-in ballots can be made if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the person in second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the candidates mentioned.
The vote count may also be made in its entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal or less than one percent, provided that an explicit application is made by a party representative whose candidate has finished second. In this case, the electoral packages that have been suspended from a partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections are in the same situation in Morelia, where, according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is just under 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 voting protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
Its ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés poured down on Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday evening. On Monday, the funeral show and a mass took place.
According to family members, the lieutenant colonel's last will was to spread his ashes over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honour, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila, along with the others killed in the accident, in a plane of the Mexican Air Force. The colonel's closest person participated in the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon at noon, the ashes of the lieutenant colonel landed on the mourning hall, which is located on Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came from.
At 5.30 p.m. his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology. This mortuary show was initiated by his former classmates from the technical high school and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio belonged during his preparation for the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains. He had always said so to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From their point of view, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, extraordinary as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it because they thought it would even get dizzy on a truck. Nevertheless, he always wanted to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good person. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to greet him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán to graduate his family member. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
One Last Farewell
The Mexican Air Force Lieutenant-Colonel Felipe Bacio Cortés, under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López, was honored with his honor by the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military Territory, the Mexican Air Force, the headmaster and students of the Saltillo Technological Education Institute, where he studied in 1985 and was outstanding in both study and sport.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter flown by him, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority also sat, crashed.
At 6:05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the forecourt of the barracks. There, his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers, were already waiting for him.
The abandoned body was found on a property on the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military personnel introduced eleven people to the media who had been arrested in the same village in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by shots in different body parts and a grace shot in an abandoned finca in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at kilometer 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passers-by saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood up across the border.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people inside about three meters away, which they immediately reported to the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow t-shirt and dark trousers, without shoes; next to him lay another dressed with a white top.
The body of another person with a red t-shirt and blue trousers lay just under a metre away.
All three of them were lying on their stomachs.
According to the information received on the spot, the three persons must have been murdered in another place, as no shell casings were found.
On the wall of the country house inscriptions are to be read, which one organized criminal gang writes to another, in addition several shots were found in wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defence) presented 11 people, including a minor who was part of a criminal gang mainly active in the place of Cadereyta, associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo (hunting people) and secret funerals.
According to the public information, eight people were initially arrested and one prisoner freed in the Los Alveros settlement on 11 November.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured, and the arrestees confirmed that they were members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12 at 06.00, military officers found a car with no license plates with two inmates on their watch circuit in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13, at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the community of La Frauda, who tried to escape while seeing the military.
They are charged with secret burials in the towns of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday formation of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present to him the new government, which will face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present to him the new government, which will face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the Presidential Palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the formation of government.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed of a majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said he would present the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of government to the President.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well-stuck," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package called for by Europolitics in order to regain the weak confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti to press ahead has been exacerbated by the fluctuating market situation, which has put a 7 percent interest on Italian government bonds for 10 years, in line with the situation in which Greece and Ireland have been forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Industrial Association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would fully support this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe Professor Monti's efforts are aimed at achieving good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a government consisting of a majority of technocrats, which is currently forming Monti.
Support from Parliament
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or delaying reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also exerting pressure to suggest that Monti's failure is a disaster.
Monti started on Monday with its debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as youth and women's organisations.
The meeting is scheduled to be closed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who set in motion an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief reverberation at the end of last week, when it was known that Berlusconi would resign, the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister has once again reached critical limits for the cost of Italian government bonds.
Saving Italy with a sovereign debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said that his government must last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, rather than prefer the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in view of the procedure imposed by pressure from the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and divisions between the parties complicate the inclusion of people from political life.
Spaniards have more gaming opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players retrieved from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on their hump.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 invited players has 50 games behind them.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the friendly match taking place today at 3:05 p.m. in the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, number one on FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A competitions, the three-colored team has only defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international matches.
He reached this number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in the Rommel Fernández.
Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home matches (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, there are the experiences with the Spanish Fury at complicated elimination matches at the Eurocup and the World Cups.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international encounters in the context of the Concaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last register: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who reached a tie with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta last Saturday against England (decrease 0-1 in London) with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the three-color team and Spain will record a new record of 127 international matches.
Xavier Hernández, player of Barcelona football club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavier even received recognition last week from UEFA, along with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle stormer of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol also approaches the number one hundred with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side-stormer Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there, only five games were played: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The one with the least games.
Less than 30 games are featured in Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the side of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even approach the 20's border.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored the most with nine goals, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is realized"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is ready to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
More than 20 years they were expected, but the band assures that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, they perform at the National Stadium from 7.30 p.m. along with band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the conversation, the full copy of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realized for us.
This is just the second time that we have played in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I have only been to Costa Rica once for a holiday. It is such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted. They experience the days before the concert intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and it took us so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've put down in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on some huge shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we feel like playing there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are excited about the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for surfing. Together with Mexico, these are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we also set ourselves no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes a different song, so the decision we're going to play is not easy.
If we record two or three songs that we haven't played for a long time, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they might be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think that's why it's also for the audience.
With this tour you are celebrating your twenty-year history.
When you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagined playing in a great rock band for more than 20 years. It seems like a dream.
We continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are thrilled to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be any better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of big bands.
We're good friends with Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then a band comes out of a city, but it is unusual when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are still looking forward to being friends with them all and it honors us to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. This alone is a lot more time than many bands outlast.
First of all, I believe that we are all happy to be alive and also to take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up, giving each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't get any better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy, but on the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to fall into this game with huge crowds of people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came for the music, that reminds you that you have to watch the music and what it has brought into being, without being obsessed with being a famous rock star. We never cared about that anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built up the band with us, friends. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why the band chose for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band the best. Therefore, we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live.
Why do you always change Yellow Ledbetter's lyrics when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he can think of.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
Of so many+
The first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fad?
I think we all don't feel very attached to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think that's great, because it's worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she's more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a little frivolous, but there are other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in themselves.
The tears came to me when I heard Ed playing them. They are very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example when you lose a family member or a friend - that influences your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embody this for me.
But I also think that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to hospital for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his family doctor informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who serves 25 years in prison for violation of human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which operates four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, congressman and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish for this because he considered him innocent.
He was operated on four times on tongue cancer and he lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition, there are other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía detention centre since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the Peruvian Army's death squad, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the Uruguayan president, this will be the highlight of his booked-up schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for exchanging information on all policy areas between the two countries," the South American country's presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón's support for the incident with France when French head of government Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that still act as tax havens. This statement was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request from his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and industrialised countries. Since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has sought to accelerate the concretization of tax information exchange agreements in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is the focus of countries that have not introduced all international standards for tax cooperation.
Since 2004, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay, which has contributed to a growing trade in goods between the two countries.
The purr-beard installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years for the rescue of Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game that comes this month to the store counters all over the world has been tailored from the beginning to the features of the Nintende 3DS portable console, with which you can play three-dimensionally without special glasses.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," assured Omar Álvarez, the person responsible for the Nintendo-specialized press in Spain, at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game developed from the beginning for this console" because until now, success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman underlined that although it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" was an "affordable" video game that allowed a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "light" to capture the less tasted users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" over the different game levels, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action in real time. However, in order to overcome the obstacles without becoming victims of the "optical effects", they always have to play three-dimensionally.
This trip of Super Mario into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the Saga and repeats the recipe for success of recent editions: The purr-beard installer must overcome dangerously-picked platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news in movements, the environment, disguises and enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom warrants the extradition of Portillo to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would allow the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo, so that he would be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy to money-launder US$70 million.
Thus the trial of the U.S. application for extradition of Portillo ends, so that it can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed his decision on the independence of judicial authority and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that he had not interfered with court decisions during his government and had accepted all extradition requests he was notified of.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is extradited for murder and serious assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's action is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited when his legal situation in Guatemale is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for embezzling 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his reign. This trial preceded extradition, but the minister filed a protest and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organisation was set up to avoid the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social assistance organisation Trinijove have led to important results: in this quarter century, 6000 young people threatened with social exclusion were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are over a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event was held yesterday in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was launched in 1986 in the district of Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems at risk of marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of those in charge of institutions and institutions working with the association during these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives from different directions during campaign times demonstrated the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
Besides the president of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former socialist minister of education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green city councillor Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and the Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and Jaume Lanaspa, Director General of the Sparkasse La Caixa Social Works.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was launched in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is "a good basis".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in trouble.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does," he explained.
Occupied house where giant parties were held was vacated
The homeowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without resisting.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of house No. 51 on the street Balmes have ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building, which they had illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The eviction was carried out by judicial order without police intervention.
After the eviction, the door lock was changed to avoid a similar situation.
"As of now, access will be controlled," confirmed the house manager.
The squatters, who occupied 11 of the building's 13 apartments - the rest were inhabited - took with them the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. They also painted the walls and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that her business had decreased by 80% since the beginning of the occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the squatters made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure restaurant had been reported by the neighbors for disturbance of rest, while according to her statement the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the squatters, and in particular from the guests of the festivals organized there, and which, according to the angered neighbors, became more and more and longer in recent weeks.
The head of the discotheque stated that the harassment had been so great that it agreed with the owner of the building that no rent had to be paid for the last nine months.
Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that she had received more complaints from the neighbors in recent weeks.
Last week, the chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, called for the building to be evacuated immediately and the problems of civil coexistence and the decline of the neighbourhood to be tackled.
He explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before the summer, but that the squatters had advanced to all floors of the building and almost all the apartments in the last few months. In some, even theft had occurred.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against the anti-social acts in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was evacuated by the Catalonian police.
At 3.30 p.m., police approached Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people entering the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the disputes about fees, the architects agree to the tender.
The urban call for tenders for the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its reproach letter on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers with Central Park of New York.
With the sinking of the CMB in 1987, the park became, in the eyes of many, the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in the north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a nature park plays with this idea.
The role of the yogi bear was no longer modeled on Central Park, but on Yellowstone with wild boars.
As far as the city was concerned, in September the city issued a huge invitation to tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either that's the case, or someone's planning to set goals on the country.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, Park or Berg?
The call for tenders is not only from an organizational point of view, but also in view of a reflection on the city, the topic of discussion in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is already almost a recurring issue, on which two members of this old entrenched caste, who meet in the elevator, can fall back.
And that is exactly the fact that offers the material for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it and some university professors who applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, it is "necessary" to talk about the "front of the mountain" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, the one about the green apples, has not been conducted.
"One should assume the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Tore of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": it must not be imagined "as entrances to a park, but as a limitation of areas in which to act."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that carries "some dangers".
Risks arising from the "uncertainty that the design of a public space brings with it today" following the experience of the 1980s, who had their "swan singing" in the forum area.
The first fear is one's own limitation to what can be cultivated.
"Restricting something always means setting the next step", i.e. crossing it.
"You have to think about new urban planning tools, because the present [referring to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who adheres more closely to the question, says that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study of the Patronage de Collserola that should not "get on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration for giving its committee the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountains to the city is the guide letter, which allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubt" about whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams that have been set up ("just the right thing," he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, as the terms of the tender lack a global view of Collserola: "There were 16 competitions advertised in the cross-section," he says, "on the mountain-sea axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that views the area as a whole."
This has at least led to him participating in the 16 competitions in his case.
Otherwise, the program and definition of a project for a gate would clash with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is equipped in its entire length directly above the Ronda de Dalt, creating a soft transition between town and green zones.
Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, Casino Red's agent freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial being conducted against him for suspected extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the Casino Red agent has granted him to the District's Second Criminal Court, which is leading the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos depicting Manuel Jonás, who allegedly forced him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration would approve the secret operation of the betting house.
After the lawsuit, the prosecution opened a criminal case against the brother of the Panist mayor, who was arrested for 30 days on 2 September.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In this place, he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after Ministerio Público's official had dismissed the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Detention Centre for allegedly bribed the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the media security wing, as death threats existed against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an inmate of the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, the secretary of the District's Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, sent him a detention order, which found that after almost two months of investigations, there was sufficient evidence to make Jonás guilty of paying the House's representatives 1.5 million pesos in exchange for opening it.
This Monday, Casino Red's plenipotentiary, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina to punish the mayor's brother, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the court-affiliated Ministerio Público, asked García Gómez whether he had corrected the damage and who had given his forgiveness to the owner of the betting house. However, the lawyer held the name back.
According to case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is free to speak. Furthermore, no objection can be filed against the trial in the following and no compensation is requested.
After hearing the authorised representative of the betting house at 3:50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and his case was put on file.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details of the aircraft accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transporte - SCT (Secretary of Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people were killed indicate that the helicopter with its whole intact structure has collided directly against the ground without the pilot being able to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before take-off that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller blades had contact with trees at 25 meters height, with the helicopter losing the fuselage, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also stated that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, which is why it met all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the machine was run down.
"In the search no aircraft parts were found at other places, the impact affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At the moment it is a priority to get the results as soon as possible, but it could take several months, perhaps even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, General Director of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretary for Aircraft and Relief Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidencial had flown at cruising speed and the aircraft had fallen to a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of impact."
At a press conference, the head of SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of visual flight. This means that the crew must have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at take-off. During the onward flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some low-hanging clouds rose.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with better visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley because of the clouds.
Impact point:
The collision coordinates and the last radar record of the helicopter are identical. There may have been neither a loss of control over the aircraft nor a deviation from the flight route before the collision.
Dispersal of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter had collided from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered remnants of aircraft suggests that the helicopter had hit the ground with its intact structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft do not indicate fire or explosion at the scene of the accident.
The latest results indicate several ground contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is sloping and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter was probably broken.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a minute search in an area that went beyond the blocked area at the scene of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the unharmed aircraft structure had bounced against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol on finding the gene for obesity
She is the head of a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is leading a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth", with which the genetic markers are to be found in connection with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the IMSS sports grounds in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are carried out every Saturday from 8 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation began on the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and continued on the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) since 8 October.
Once the target of 500 to 600 investigators has been reached, the study will be continued on the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and completed on the one of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He stated that the aim of the study was to learn about the factors and role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors for Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global diabetes day, he said that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 should fill out nutritional questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and family history in order to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He also stated that on the aforementioned Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, size, waist size), their blood pressure and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (trying to identify genes related to childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of the concern of health workers about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years, the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent. Obesity also increased dramatically," stressed the specialist of the IMSS.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of Mexico's population differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that a (e) Mexican (in) is on average 65 percent of Indian-American descent, 30 percent of European descent, and 5 percent of African descent, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess of the energy (calories) we consume, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants was a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin wrinkles in the neck and inner arm (akanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information will be kept confidential and communicated to parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors will explain to parents all the results of the measurements and propose to them changes in lifestyle that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three fundamental factors responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, i.e. an increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbohydrates (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.), along with a high intake of fat and protein, as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM, develops polymer-modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs from the pavement were to be observed, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 potholes when the rainy season breaks out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (Mexico Valley City Area), Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warned and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt surface were properly damaged, the number of potholes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Troughholes from a Technical Perspective", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing polymer-modified asphalt to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Mr. Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road surface and thus avoid the occurrence of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound of which one part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphaltenes - and the other part a low - the so-called Malthene. Together they give the road surface its characteristic viscous elastic behaviour.
Elastic behaviour of the asphalt means that at high temperatures of almost 180°C it behaves like a liquid, at 120°C it is very viscous and almost solid at 50°C, while it becomes fragile at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," said the chemical engineer.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of flexible pavements, composed of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a wear layer of asphalt consisting of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer had been bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on and produce forces, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"On top of the wear layer," he said, "a final layer is laid out, the so-called bearing layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they have to produce friction.
In addition, the load-bearing layer needs an adequate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes wet, water penetrates into the layer and is difficult to escape again. This causes a softening of all layers of the road surface and consequently the occurrence of potholes.
When a pothole is created," he said, "the cover layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only damaged afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but is a process that must be repaired by appropriate maintenance programs at the first signs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of potholes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be proportional to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that a lot of research was still to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries, and with which the potholes could be repaired easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What was the candidate del Valle missing to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th distitle.
Once again Valle del Cauca went empty in the award of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with being on the winning podium, a silver crown and the tape she identifies as a new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department already comes to 14 mistitles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in their hands. Among the proclaimed misses are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many are asking today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favourite who had shown at each demonstration that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing she had been elected Queen of the Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that had also been given to the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor that is considered crucial for the jury's decision to appoint her First Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "Which book has influenced you most and why?" that had been asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I pretty much believe in literature, I think it's a way to civilize, in the end I believe that the book that was the most influential for my childhood is 'The Little Prince', a rather profound book.
At the moment I am reading 'Schuld und Sühne'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Passion'.
An answer that met with little love, firstly because of the notion of 'civilizing' and secondly because it had not explained in concrete terms how each book she mentioned had influenced her.
But at the end of the ceremony, Melina declared to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for everyone: Please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle has burned out.
A journalist from Bogota hinted that the fact that she was the favorite who took all the side effects and who had received all the prizes in advance (Easter gastronomy contest, audience vote on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other contestants jealous, which stressed the queen, which could therefore not shine on stage."
And this was noticed at her first performance in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at her two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although she performed safely in both of them, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the contestant who wins the most prizes during the competition will not eventually become Queen".
In addition, Valle went out of the way of the press at the end - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jurie about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty stated they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, on the fact that she had already worked on projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of derriere and fibrosis, which were noticed in her stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The trainer of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there would be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the abdomen, which, frankly, was hardly noticeable to me, pushed her score the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the woman from Valle del Cauca's mistake was the surgical procedures she underwent.
"The operations are ok, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay."
Because of this award, which was awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction was made after the appearance in the bathing suit, which was to come true at night. It was whispered that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina will begin her reign from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent at one of the international competitions on the appointment of the National Beauty Competition Colombia.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who had escaped the crown despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopeist from Cali entered history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4, a Lophoscopeist of the Criminal Investigation Unit (CTI) from Cali, who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Forces of Colombia), went into action: "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopeists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González was on standby, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working on criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities in Chocó, where he often had to go into the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
During the week of the campaign against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he flew in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world could be. Therefore, he should take with him the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached with the examiner the place where the body was located, he could not identify him due to his physical appearance, for this did not resemble the images he had seen in the mass media in the slightest.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, plant ladle, and flashlight, Eliazar compared the body's fingerprints to those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: It was Alfonso Cano.
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was actually the head of the FARC.
Searching for clues
For a dactyloscope from the Sijín in Cali, the tribute given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
The dactyloscopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopeists not only identify corpses, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many offenders submit false identity papers or have none.
We'll take the fingerprints off them and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that during a theft he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had supported himself with his hand right here when he pulled out a safe stuffed with jewelry and money.
"Wounds are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
The fingerprints can also be used to relieve or burden murder suspects.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspect, and actually a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, he is nevertheless associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A Dactyloscopician of the CTI stated that "the fingerprints were taken from the object with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a plant ladle or ribbon is used to take them away.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the civil status office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identity papers," the expert from the CTI explained.
He said that not everything was as depicted in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold that shines isn't all you touch, a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "indignants" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered in tents on Zuccotti Square.
Much of it followed the eviction order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged the authorities of New York this Tuesday when they again tried to enter Manhattan Square with a judicial order after being vacated from the square at dawn and trying to occupy another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to gain access with a judicial order allowing the "indignants" to again camp at this point. Meanwhile, another part of the movement adhered to the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city where nine arrests took place.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will gather in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-in and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the Movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray stated that the response of the "indignants" to the eviction of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to justice, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent eviction of the place and authorising the protesters to camping.
In addition, the "indignants" occupied a new park, which is located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, and is property of Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but after that the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray cannot give exact figures. He assured the Efe news agency that he had also seen several journalists handcuffed.
The organization assured that hundreds of people had gathered here, where a delegation of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square (a privately owned site) remains closed pending a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday to analyse the legality of the eviction taking place at dawn.
Some of the protesters driven from the square carried photocopies of this judicial order and distributed them. They even gave them to some police officers who were guarding the square, resulting in "some small clashes", as Bray reported, who had reported that some police had beaten protesters.
The judicial order forbids the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street from the square, as well as the application of "laws passed after the occupation and prohibit the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that due to this judicial order the reopening of the square to the public and the protesters had been lifted. He pointed out to the protesters that the city laws did not allow them to set up again with tents and sleeping bags at this place.
The mayor personally defended the eviction of Zuccotti Square at dawn, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators "dismissed the right."
Bloomberg stated that he had given the order to clear the place because it had "turned into a place where people did not come to protest, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people", because "some businesses had received threats" and the residents "feared for their quality of life".
"The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of North American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting press freedom".
The leaders of Occupy Wall Street informed that they were thinking about organizing "great actions" for Thursday, along with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been going on since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary on the TV Christmas Show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Canadian television Christmas show.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson along with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities will appear on December 1 in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
Today, CTV broadcast images of the television program in which Anderson - which also appears for the distribution on the Internet of a self-made porno, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as a Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap that is supposed to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently worked as a presenter on the show "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, appears as a Jesus child.
CTV's Christmas program not only relies on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far away from this controversy.
Recently, Bublé had described North American Kim Kardashian as "whore" at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Reborn After Earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still recovering from the destructive earthquake that resulted in a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster Japan had experienced during World War II.
The government’s initial estimates in Tokyo assessed the damage to property at $300,000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of cases, the data on gross domestic product from July to September were finally used to complete this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% compared to the annual rate.
The value measured in the second quarter - the business year in Japan starts in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the machine sale for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the decline of 0.9% for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the real shift in the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynsian impulses that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has awakened, in particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by the growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has committed itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - fleeing into one of the "currencies of refuge" of investors fleeing from the eurozone's debt crisis and the turbid forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is like a gravestone on the accounts of export companies.
With a tougher currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the Yen.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"One must pay attention to the continuing risks, for example the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of the floods in Thailand and the rapid upgrading of the Yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy, yesterday.
The prospects are really not very uplifting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had shown clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, showed that the biggest economic potentials would have been put at a brake.
For it sank by four tenths up to los 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average, which is 100, after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens gives rise to doubt again
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
Greece continues to get lost in the labyrinth of the major European debt crisis with the increased risk premiums of peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is a reaction to the pressure from Brussels rather than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly proved by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days he had agreed to appoint were perhaps too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and would by no means withdraw his demand for new elections on the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the 26 October summit," said Papadimos yesterday to open a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, reform of disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not remove doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader went one step too far with his challenge to the EU and IMF, the organism that needs to unlock the 8000 million that Athens desperately needs, and made it clear that he would not endorse any commitment to meet the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand should not be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties would sign "a clear written agreement not as soon as possible".
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, stated that the Troika inspectors "very soon" would return to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed for the payment of the sixth section" in the amount of 8000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek ball still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "dominating" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that Spain has become the second donor of this instrument for international cooperation worldwide in the last two decades, whose "being" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity based on trust in people".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the Fifth World Summit on microcredit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the millennium goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular, the target of the number of people who have to live with income of less than one dollar a day, i.e. below the "poverty limit".
Spain continues to work on expanding the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it is carrying out this task responsibly," said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will be derived from the summit, which will last until Thursday, will be "guaranteed the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "face many challenges."
The summit on microcredit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for launching "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen stated that it was intended that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty line.
In Spain and the rest of the world, the concept of microcredit goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia considers to be an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financial instrument as an "admirable idealist committed to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about the local loan strategy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings at Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We have observed a continuous development," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project brought her yesterday's assessment as "Head of the Family" in Valladolid and as "Proponent of the Poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her lecture by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to tie development aid to times of economic booms because it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez felt that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty", and that the governments of the developed countries now have to work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success", "marginized" people who "always stand in front of closed doors" to give "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its gates, stoked by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU) on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig was without real difficulties for Angela Merkel, chancellor and chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was originally not foreseen in the programme, but prevailed in the autumn, in particular in order to satisfy those activists who regard the government policy on the Greeks as too lax today and possibly Italy tomorrow.
The European Commission's proposal for a presidency proposed by the Bureau was adopted almost unanimously.
Under 1001 delegates, only nine voted against, ten abstained.
The standing ovation, which lasted several minutes, which was initially valid for Angela Merkel and several hours later Wolfgang Schäuble due to her intervention decrees, left no doubt on the part of the three European-led finance ministers.
The Chancellor's main idea, as well as the request, has the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "no less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in a modification of the Lisbon Treaty, which reinforces the control of the European Union as regards the countries' budgetary policies in the euro area, but could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote to give Europe a face".
However, this is definitely one of the proposals approved by Congress, which were clearly supported by Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is not likely that the 47 will agree quickly on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone is set.
Similarly, the delegates, in an overwhelming majority, rejected the proposal of weighting each country on the ECB Executive Board according to the weighting of individual economies, which would obviously lead to a strengthening of Germany's position.
The Chancellor, who is concerned about calming the climate within her party, has therefore reinforced the points of reference for Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
In so far as the Europe application devotes a paragraph to the importance of the "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that two centuries ago Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in sick reports?
After the family allowances, UMP and the government are now tackling the health reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November to visit a family allowance fund and present a speech on the theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to test the economy in a harsh manner, but which, on the other hand, is no less harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on workers' health reports.
First of all with budgetary objectives: the government plans to introduce a fourth waiting day before taking into account a health report for employees in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the salary of four days without the permission of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure, which according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos" threatens to provoke anger, but would help to contribute 280 million euros.
And this would be accompanied by another measure of a more symbolic character: to grant the state officials an unpaid waiting day in the event of illness (so far there is no waiting period for them, unlike the three waiting days in the private sector).
In the meantime, these issues are under discussion, and the majority is also rekindling the subject of fraud, this time aiming at the abuse associated with absence of work.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition, they will have to be refunded if required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November, before the RTL transmitter microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this notification on the reality of fraud in the area of disease reporting seems to be somewhat disproportionate.
This has indeed been the subject of permanent observation since 2002, as well as political offensives that have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer sick more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
First, however, let us look at the national figures.
According to the CNAM State Sickness Fund, more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health Care, the daily severance payments in 2008 amounted to EUR 11.3 billion, representing 5% of health expenditure.
This figure was 46% for maternity leave, accidents at work and 54% for sick leave, i.e. €6.2 billion.
And thus 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the average number of sick days was 14.5 compared to the 17.8 days in 2009.
An average that covers up certain differences: another one, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40.000 surveyed French workers stated they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of health reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared with its European neighbours, French workers no longer tend to be incapacity for work than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (sickness or otherwise justified) oscillated, in France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in sick leave accounts for a very small proportion of undeclared work.
As far as fraud is concerned, only a small amount is achieved here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic checks on disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM (the public college for the training of technicians and engineers) found that under 1.5 million checks, 13% of the 285,000 short-term reports carried out, which means 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
In the case of more than 45 days of systematic control of illness reporting, less than 1.2 million 11% of cases "unadapted or unjustified" were reported, i.e. 132,000.
Thus, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are made against several million workers who have filed a complaint.
A figure which represents only a weak balance with, for example, those of undeclared work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a factual report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the deframation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needed a new adjustment programme to intercept its economy.
This had been announced on Monday, 14 November, by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in front of Parliament, adding that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue efforts to boost the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of government in his first public speech in opening the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's involvement within the Eurozone was at stake, as he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's government deficit "by the 9%" of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new austerity measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent to the already approved measures regarding an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but had sent forward that his party would not be prepared to pay any additional savings.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a congress of his New Democracy party.
He had agreed with the targets of reducing the budget deficit and debt, as well as fighting waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner with economic and monetary responsibilities, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties about their support for the planned measures, had replied to Antonio Samaras that his word was enough and he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalised, according to an expert panel
Canadians live in denial of death, reports the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, going beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a refusal to face death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, intertwined in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the penal law in such a way as to allow accompanying suicide and euthanasia, where this choice is made, in patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts cite a recently published survey by the independent society EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada has placed itself in 10th place, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid of cutting the subject of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, so the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report to us.
And despite the Canadian majority's desire to die at home, 68.6% of them ultimately die in the hospital.
From the country as a whole, the rate is highest in Quebec at 86% of hospital deaths.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not intend to make any changes to the penal law on euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
But now, according to the experts, all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide, have been inspected by the same experts, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would lead to abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanying suicide by uncompetent or unwilling persons.
On the contrary, there are many more cases of such transgressions, especially in countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Accompanied suicide is also practised in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians advocate euthanasia
Let us bear in mind that, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already cleared up in favour of euthanasia, since they believe that it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact that euthanasia is legalised does not lead to the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
With regard to those who have already committed an accompanying suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or cessation of treatments in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
Similarly, they suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the withdrawal of funds for which a legally valid rejection has been submitted should not be considered criminal.
The Expert Panel also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the loss of resources at the end of their lives, without fear of criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, going beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the methods of pain relief or life-saving measures already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, the Panel calls for at least consideration, as they did not serve to reduce physical pain and refer to the same procedures as euthanasia.
Reservations from other experts
Some experts in the field of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deshamps, a specialist in health law, has called the attitude of the reporting experts, among other things, "extreme", since it sets no limits to euthanasia practice for patients in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation in which everyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years of age asks another person to help him commit suicide," said Rashamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
Dishamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place individual responsibility above all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there are "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, health law specialist, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she called "Pro-Euthanasia Manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly doubtes the reporting on the absence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad yesterday demonstrated in front of the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria's Bashar al-Assad, which, however, resists it thanks to Russia's support and rejects a "complot" directed against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League's expulsion from Syria, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, despite Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbours, taking a position in favor of President Assad's resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the acting Arab Prime Minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "depose his official power in Syria" in which about forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he would resign, but in addition he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, Syria's neighbour, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, lamented that the Turkish mediation attempts aimed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must leave," he said, alluding to Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey is taking a steadily harsher stance.
For its part, the United States welcomed the "enhancement of consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have struck an ever-increasing tone in the face of repression in Syria," observes Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of government in the Dar'a region of southern Syria have died, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights proclaimed OSDH.
According to this NGO, two other civilians had died in the besieged city of Homs in "shooting changes and heavy bombings for Jobar".
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless considered the country's "tax towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has reacted emphatically to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which he considers to be a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not give in," he added under the plea that "the plots forged against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé also spoke out in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from the regime's repression of ensnaring themselves after him in his "paranoia".
An extra-scheduled re-meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis phase-out plan adopted on 2 November, in particular the controversial, probable withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of imprisoned protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov described the Arab League's decision yesterday as "uncorrect" in order to avoid supporting possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, future head of the Italian government, has called for a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that "victims" demand to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme involving a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, MP of one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had to wait for Mario Monti to give Parliament a vote of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The arrangements will culminate in the presentation by M. Monti of a list of deletions, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of stock market and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government as well as a government program, he stressed, under the remark that it would be "sure that the markets will show themselves dutiful and discreet".
His appointment by the President was welcomed by the markets at the beginning, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The incumbent Prime Minister was to form a staff composed of mainly technocrats, although he had stressed that he also liked to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next general election, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's evidence of confidence by Friday.
Since taking up his role, Mr Monti has committed himself to working in all urgency in the spirit of the objective of making Italy a "renewed protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson for Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change even taking into account the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budget balance objective in 2013, despite the austerity plans taken up in recent months, has in particular requested new tough measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, head of the Italian chiefs, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic recovery, since a country that has no growth whatsoever can't respect deficit indicators".
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epoch change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolises the "challenge of trustworthiness" as well as a "other Italy", according to editorial authors.
The great unknown here would be the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy will now have to pay for 200 billion euros of state bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helps Iranian nuclear energy program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-grade detonator, confirmed Monday an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recently published report of the International Agency for Nuclear Safety AIEA and other documents originating from this UN agency to identify this scientist.
The AIEA had last week expressed its "serious concern" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, apparently had worked for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
He is said to have left the centre in 1989 or 1991 to set up a company in Kiev that produces "nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA referred to "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear explosive system" was supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only highly skilled in this technique, but also, as a member of the agency announced, had worked his entire professional career via essential on this technology directly on the military nuclear energy program of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and offences have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racially or religiously motivated violent crimes have either decreased slightly or increased only slightly in the same period, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, whereas there was a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes directed against Jews, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" had risen to 6,628 cases in a very weak measure, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," stressed the human rights organization Human Rights First."The rise in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of the law against human rights," added Paul Legendre, a leader of the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, appreciating that this could be done by improving the police attitude towards the "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" is presented in American federal law as an inheritance from the era of struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish acts of violence directed against race, colour, religion or descent, and now also involves offences of sexual affiliation.
Twitter transforms the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
On Monday, the Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to enable its users, in particular, to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, making the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" allow better legible live understanding of the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") are tracked and who track your messages.
This makes it possible to find out whether they allow their messages to be tracked, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday"in August with a small percentage of users", said Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner in front of the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, endowed with something esotheric-looking wording (RT for referenced repetition of another person's contribution). followfriday pour recommender de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users debated about this innovation via the Internet with the help of certain "tweets".
"This is useless, intrusive, and too much Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The "Activity" function will help me to better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entry of a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution
The government of the large Social Democratic/Christian Democratic coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also avoid any degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top credit rating (AAA).
It was the Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, much higher than the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If Austria's solvency did not fall at a blow from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros in additional interest each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democrat Foreign Minister.
Austria also makes a request at the Brussels Summit of the eurozone Member States on 26 October: the Heads of State or Government at the time demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012, as well as a return to the public balance of accounts in the Constitution or by adopting an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government for this purpose is similar to the "German model", since Germany had been the first European country to have included such a "rule" in the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and as of 2017, the state's structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, while the regional states and municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eliminate budgetary debt in the 2020/21 horizon under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement.
Strong yen
Noda faces new intervention in currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that Japanese authority would intervene again in currency markets if the Yen continued to rise.
"If we find an excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, we will intervene just as we did the last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen again jumped close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold yen against dollars to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is about to set a new record value since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has regularly risen above it, doped by purchases of investors who see the yen as "excursion value" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped below the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was listed around the 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This booming fire of Japanese motto harms the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the cost of the "made in Japan" products and reduces the income value extracted from abroad by Japanese companies, as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and tsunami on 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast)," says M. Noda, who fears that this inflation of the Yen can already kill the weak upswing in the bud.
With growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - the third world economic power has regained traction for the first time this year thanks to the jump in export growth and consumption of households "sealed" by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the yen's inflation does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
For its part, Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to defuse the Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, has informed that the BoJ has already initiated "appropriate measures", which has made it clear that no additional currency easing is to be expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its state bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) in order to clear the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of cover it had spent on various purchases of financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
Euro-zone:
Rapid interest rates, stock exchanges pull back
The contagion risk of the debt crisis is constantly undermining European key figures.
Despite the new heads of government in Greece and Italy taking office and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are drifting into negative areas this Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions in government bond yields in the eurozone in difficulty, global equity markets continue to release some of their recent profits.
"Capital investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which for its part suffers from the renewed fear of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe that the debt crisis would continue, had closed with a baisse of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe, and trade moves on a limited corridor of variation as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the euro area is damaging the single currency, which continues its bailout on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for one and a half months.
At 10 o'clock, the European Valuta was worth 1.3570 dolls, so it gave up by 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it has declined after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered in Congress on Monday, approved a request that specifically provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to exit the eurozone without simultaneously leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The interest rates on loans from Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the Italian bond yields reached 6.85% for 10 years, while the Spanish title reached 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel investor fears.
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, demanded more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by paralysis caused by the debt burden.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Eurozone summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the visir of the markets, as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new historical high.
In anticipation of growth figures in the euro-zone
Statistically, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, driven by household consumption, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office (INSEE) revised the figures for the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In reality, it is the fourth quarter that worries the economic experts most.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
An initial projection of the eurozone as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., with the European Commission warning against the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as an opportunity to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, an enormous proportion of the world's population should not have to renounce a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to mitigate the shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity constantly, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to fight against climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to forego nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which submits its decision to the need to find a substitute source capable of substitution, nor in Switzerland, which just intends to build nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
After Fukushima, the United States, for its part, decided to add another unit to their park by restarting the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model, which is geared to renewable energy sources, is occasionally presented as an example, reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will take the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, especially on Russia, as a result of the increased use of imported gas, and an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will already be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to reflection.
Denmark is, on the one hand, the European leader in the table on wind energy, from which it obtains 30% of its electricity, and, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% respectively higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% higher electricity bills than our French households.
Since the price of energy in the globalised economy is a key element of competitiveness and a guarantee of stability for industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage due to the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong increase in energy prices, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys showed that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are just as unwilling to pay as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us bear in mind that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125,000 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a plethora of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France decided to phase out nuclear power, most of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual EUR 6 billion in exports of capital goods and nuclear energy would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would commission an EPR designed to work for sixty years if the decline of his producer is preprogrammed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one must admit that there is no more a miracle tool for generating electricity than a devil's work.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy are proof of the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing plants, such as the construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the safety concept.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only a single one, in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, so it ran without consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was conjured up by reactor construction and infinite human error.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented proportions that caused the death of several ten thousand people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it did after the previous two.
As a fruit of this approach and of cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a design that enables it to withstand such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party leaders dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overloading police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a numerical policy, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had titled itself.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students from the official side had shaped the weekly shows, the Interior Minister had casually (see Libération of 23 May) announced that France "had no talent, bricklayers or waiters from abroad needed".
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right hand side, the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990 that France "cannot absorb all the world's poverty".
The only difference is the degree of generosity
Fear of the invasion of national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was divided from both right and left in 2005.
Both camps perceived immigrants as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that one is willing to admit to immigrants.
Francois Hollande, in his programme, confines himself to banalities which point out that development in partnership allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present to us in a recent work summarizing the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Limiting immigration would undermine growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they are threatening to substitute the local labour force, especially the lower-skilled, by exerting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than domestic wage-earners, since they are mainly engaged in occupations in sectors which are technically unencumbered.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local wage earners, the more skilled among the immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not aligned with labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, this complementarity also causes a positive effect of immigrant migration on wages and the national labour market.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the influx of immigrants would result in an inclusive, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas introduced by immigrants as well as economic growth is beneficial (high proportion of naturalised immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, on average around 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 will, on average, contribute a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of around EUR 150,000 to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring about the missing intersections "with the teeth" at the beginning of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which should deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now it remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a delicate asset.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had let the entire 20th century pass over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some had believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy prevail over their enemies once and for all.
One knows since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a characteristic of the mental attitude.
The general right to vote, the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can just as well become an "oppression instrument", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, an education, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe we are in is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first and foremost a political and democratic crisis.
The change of attitude of the Greek True-False referendum would have had a double enlightening character in this regard: the need for a powerful return of politics, but also the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to push for a success of the national referendum, which was organized in accordance with the needs and in wrong order.
A free pass for the European sole ruler or a blind jump into the void of nationalistic withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, from full right, settled and steady, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - it is no longer clear where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is all Europe that is bowing to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, suffering from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated at international level.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - it is all Europe which is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every single one of the nations attached to it.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the leadership of the European project.
It is a matter of the whole of whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and launch a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level as a condition, which cannot be made without total democratic legality, without certainly leading us to ruin.
After a long time of fighting this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone today is pushing European economic governance.
Agreed.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it suggests to the citizens - this would be a new folly and a further impasse.
We must take on a new stage in European integration.
In order to create the republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This teaching remains valid.
We must form a more integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become general goods
The World Chip Card Fair opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurossmart, 2011 was supposed to end with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is the contactless technology that allows payments on public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless smart cards would be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment, having been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
Consumer markets, however, are steaming up.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move to a higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out bank cards with contactless chips to their customers in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
To date, a tiny percentage of devices have been equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
"They're in delay".
"But they should at least experience a real upward trend next year."
"In 2012, we expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société Générale had yesterday declared to prepare the launch of an offer that allows their customers contactless payment by mobile phone.
Terrorist Front understands itself, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspected relationship between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seems to confirm.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now acquired "certainty".
"The way in which both organizations operate, as well as the relations of the secret services, indicate clear cooperation," he said without going further into detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January had exposed interfaces.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped by supporters of the Aqmi in a restaurant in Niamey, are said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their hijackers during an operation carried out by the French Special Forces.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble at the scene of the operation.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the telephone calls led to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one leads to a Nigerian who has long been in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria that had stopped the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man considered close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but there is no doubt that we need to wait for clearer evidence before we can talk about an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem".
"It's conceivable, though".
"For years, it has been known that the sect has attracted financial and intellectual support from outside and that it is becoming increasingly active," says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become increasingly visible in their course, as well as the speeches and operational modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the involvement of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives, which bear the same signature as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, to start with Washington, has since then been exerting pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed for a long time regarded the group as a community of Illuminati, to which no special attention needs to be paid.
Faster success
Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri near a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a disgrace" - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this destitute region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict observance of the Shariah, while the activists attached to it fight against the godless central government.
The activists initially target churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in their intensified attacks against the commissioners.
However, Abuja's reaction is as usual indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, counting 800 dead.
The imprisoned Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming increasingly radical and leaving its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to an attack in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, then to another one in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is blamed for a suicide attack that occurred in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters became the primary international target.
Since then, the formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has troubled all security experts.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria,ta Alain Juppé warned against Boko Harem and showed himself ready to "communicate all clues".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq, and aid to Israel.
Can a crisis-stricken America lead a complex world with simple, not to say simple, ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidate, voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their fellow fighters have repeatedly announced their thundering statements and statements regarding foreign policy, a traditional Republican focus.
Slogans about China, Iran and Israel's aid - often in no way underpinned - fall.
The highest-ranking Mitt Romney in terms of the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and to accuse them of "currency manipulation" - a leading issue in an America that has been irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
Dumbly run if this is to imply the start of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost cut off the air in terms of his emotional gesture.
He had called for a tangible but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman is not heard, as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear program were to fail.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he had tinted.
"When Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb".
In addition, he promised Israel increased military assistance and accused Obama of remaining guilty of commitments to this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second-highest-placed candidate, for his part, shows a shameful ignorance of the files.
Recently, he called for the Chinese military threat to be countered, as Beijing "attempts to develop a nuclear power" - and in doing so seemed to ignore the fact that China has already been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and demands military strikes against Iran, declares himself willing to take the American army into service in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture measures against suspected terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009 was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidacy of Michele Bachmann.
One is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight.
In opposition to the current presidential opponents, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama was himself an amateur and had to pour water into his wine, concerning the issue of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
This hostility, however, is not quite so casual.
The population rather estimates the positive balance of National Security under Obama, which Bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding itself against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to revive its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with glory and Gloria.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level, last Tuesday on the Baltic Sea coast under orchestral sound and gourmet buffet.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte symbolically turned the valve's steering wheel, which transports Russian gas to the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline is expected to deliver 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year to Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1,224 km in length that connects the St Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of French total consumption - will be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already let the eventuality of building a third line sound on your own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous building is a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will enable direct gas delivery to Germany, avoiding any path through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: it is now more difficult for them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was not afraid to compare the Nord-Stream pipeline with a "new German-Andean pact" linked to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of Poland's occupation in 1939.
This means that the issue is extremely sensitive politically.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
This, however, at the expense of decontamination of European energy, as the project has struck a breach between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to enforce its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which have strong gas consumption and whose gas deposits are running low.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out the extent to which the large gas contracts are also important from a political and economic point of view.
All this explains the broad smile of the numerous Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding the gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technology.
The underwater line is made of steel with concrete coating, which is intended to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at a depth of about 200 m.
During their construction, minefields dating from World War II had to be avoided.
"About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed for the sake of precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures to protect fauna and flora had to be taken.
The line is a long line of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which is not interrupted by anything over the entire length: neither through valves, nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have refrained from doing so, as the Swedes were little eager to see a Russian state company permanently settling at the level of their coasts.
"In the event of a accident, we close the gas passage in less than one minute," Jens Müller stated.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is not considered likely by the designers, since the weld seams were estimated to be resistant to one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot controlled for external observation purposes from a seagoing ship, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, having a diameter of one metre, is inserted into the inside of the pipeline and moved by the gas pressure.
After three complete days of locomotion through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on any deformations of the metal upon its arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to function for fifty years without even having to undergo the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
This amounts to 200 bar at the entrance point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have united their forces to realize this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated (each 15.5%), as are the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (each 9%).
These five companies have formed a group of companies called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company on a renewable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the volume of gas transported is," stated Jens Müller.
The financing of gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
Total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are prepared to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas pipeline appears on a sandy, pine-wooded coastline near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas outlet gates.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other parameters of the incoming gas before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Launched by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, by candlelight with the writing added hours.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognisable, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the eggshell sides, as over time aged.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a distributed design note book.
Maria Sebregondo, then a specialist consultant of the company, is commissioned with the market launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton rack used, for example, for upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was very popular among writers and travellers.
"Moleskine revived an old and almost forgotten object, which was regarded as an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now a brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established itself with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook inspires businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, now employs over 100 people and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of city centers and is committed to enforcing its identity.
"We followed the zeitgeist and its new writing needs, which exist despite the upswing of e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine company: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno film festival, the company also launched a cover with leopard patterns.
Moleskine profited from its success and cultural zeitgeist and understood how to diversify its products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer cases... The brand has the entire range of articles.
A success that brings envy to the table: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th week of work for the disabled".
Despite a target-oriented public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice the average average: 19% against 9% unemployment for the total population.
Disheartening?
"No, according to Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, which is organising the "work week for the disabled".
"The progress made within fifteen years is significant."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not double, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still a great deal to be done."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for disabled unemployed people before they get a job.
It is more common for older people: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no Abitur and only 10,000 disabled people are among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% for the total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to start work again, and which form the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
Remains the unspoken, the mental attitudes that are certainly but slowly developing.
A study carried out in April by the Association IMS-Entreprendre for the journal La Cité stated that the managers surveyed had "a weak level of knowledge regarding disabled people", which was "overrepresented" by "persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually underrepresented".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was laid down in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, dating from 2008, refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, General Director of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that are not respecting this law.
The proof: The number of "paying" establishments has decreased, as has the sum of the paid-in amounts between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which provides for increases in contributions, created strong pressure on companies," Pierre Blanc said.
"But this improvement also expresses a real insight, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of workplaces employ disabled workers between 20 and 49 employees, while enterprises with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a lucky thing"
Even before they faced the "Blue Tuesday Nights" (20:45 p.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not conceal their pleasure that the friendly game brought them.
It would be too far-reaching to claim that there had been a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the audience podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could well and gladly have made peace.
Five months after the spirited gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to look forward," the native Liller assures.
As for the contrast between his portrayal in club and national team, "It's a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille I am all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to start".
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought in Friday night against Romania regarding the match against France to finally "shin".
However, without neglecting the note of "fun".
He has been firing the French national team since the age of 7, and led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This inevitably contributes to further strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance:"Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
"We just ran into each other".
"To play against them is great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, sounded with good-naturedness "Stolz".
"The pride to perform a gala match".
"Stolz" also to confirm - in his capacity as "neighbour" - that France"has again become a team of very high level", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a hell of a good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is looking to share the aircraft with the Blues (the French national team) ... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
"We're about to plan one thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry".
"You will notice this at the upcoming games". The game against France involved.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism to the return match against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
Both teams lacked objectivity during the match.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, in fact, that means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to dump an opponent, Bosnia.
Given the play-off (0-0) on Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to put on the so important stamp that would have removed the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk as we have not scored an away goal".
At home, however, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will be able to get through to an audience that is just as hot as the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very close", said the optimistic, but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but are totally convinced that we can win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be part of the 2012 European Championship", but the successor of Carlos Queiroz relativized.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
A draw can already be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk as we have not scored an away goal," Bento regrets.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese would want to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning in order to "allow them no time to think."
A good idea, on condition that it is put into practice this time.
