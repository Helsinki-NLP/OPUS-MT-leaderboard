The members of the Wells Assembly are worried that they "look like muppets"
Part of the members of the Assembly are amazed by their proposal to change their title to "CUP" (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was provoked by plans to change the name of the Parliament of Wales Assembly.
Members of the entire political spectrum are worried that this may become a cause for ridicule.
One of the Labourists said that his group was worried because the new name was "Romancing with Dumb and Podlab."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, this certainly has an offensive meaning.
According to one party member, Plaid, the whole group "is not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party pointed out that his group "is not prejudiced" to the change of the name, but notes that the new name PMI (in English – MWP) has a certain verbal resemblance to "bumpet".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced like the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drawing up a draft of the bill to change the name, made the following statement: "Of course, the final decision on all descriptive names by which the members of the Assembly are called will belong to the members themselves".
The Wells Government Act of 2017 gave the Wells Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, establishing broad support for the Assembly to begin to be called the 'Parliament of Wales'.
As far as the position of its members is concerned, the Commission prefers "members of the Wales Parliament, in short "HRP", but the option "HRP" has received the greatest support after a public consultation.
The members of the assembly offer alternative options, but reaching consensus will obviously be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft of the bill for the change in a few weeks.
The reformary bill will include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualification of its members, as well as the design of the commissary system itself.
Members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they come to discussing the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change their country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is an administrative area called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on changing the name of the state, has said he will not respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name of the state is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silenced against the backdrop of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"If we look from a historical perspective, according to the old people I talked to, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Today they're both gone."
Adams says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in different ways," he added.
"The bars are no longer the living-rooms where everyone gathers regularly."
As for the churches, he voiced concern that the money from the sale of the assets would not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will be in the same situation".
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks of apartments where people live who do not help in the survival of the other sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy housing in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the closing process of these churches, as it is not likely that most of the new settlers will visit them."
Both churches were built by white shepherds before Harlem became a black neighborhood – the Metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the years after 1930.
Then the building became the property of the black residents of the neighborhood.
St. Martin's was taken over by black Christians under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is Harlem's main market street, because they didn't want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building suffered severe damage in a fire, but Father Johnson's parishioners drew up a plan to restore it, ordering the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin's, proudly calls them the "poor bells".
The expert, who used the bells in July, has another description: "Cultural treasure" and "intended historical instrument".
The relevant expert Tiffany Nga from Michigan University also noted that this is the first system of bells in the world, which was used by a black musician – Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger system at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather mentioned that St. Martin's never been replaced.
What took place at St. Martin's in the last few weeks was a complicated fairy tale, woven by architects and performers, some brought by the secular leaders of the church, and others by the bishop's diocese.
From vestiaria – which is the governing body of the congregation, consisting of secular leaders – wrote to the diocese in July, expressing his concerns that the diocese “would be willing to transfer the costs to a vestitory” although he had no role in hiring architects and performers sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark on a lobster hunt in California.
Shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while he was diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, officials reported.
The attack occurred shortly before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hummel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends about half an hour Saturday morning when he overheard the boy screaming for help and rushed in with a whole group to get him out of the water.
Hummel first thought that the child had caught a lobster and got excited, and then realized how he was screaming, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel says when he got to the boy, he found out that the entire area of his clavicle had been torn apart.
“I called everyone out of the water because there is a shark,” Hummel adds.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It is not yet known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Rescue Captain Larry Gilles has spoken in a media briefing that a shark was seen in the water a few weeks earlier, but it has been estimated not to be of a dangerous species.
Jills adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of her body.
The responsible authorities have closed access to the coast line from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Suomi in Encitinas for 48 hours for safety reasons while the investigation is under way.
Gills notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which, however, pose no danger to humans.
Sainsbury plans an offensive on the UK beauty market
Sainsbury faces Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by opening beauty stands at its sites, where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the UK beauty market, which is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while at the same time sales of fashion and household products are decreasing, the largest so far beauty stands will be located in 11 shops across the country, after which, with the success of the initiative, similar ones will be found in more sites.
The investment turn in the beauty industry is made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the racks, recently occupied by TVs, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the number of products offered to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space, similar to the proposals in Boots stores.
The supermarket also reintroduces its boutique range of makeup so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought by younger consumers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfumer will test discount programs in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, southern London last week, while the second one will be opened in Seli Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the shifting focus on shopping for smaller quantities of food daily at convenient times leads to supermarkets having to make more effort to attract buyers.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sainsbury, has said that the sites will look more and more like department stores, while the supermarket chain tries to fight the discounters Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food goods.
From Sainsbury they have Argos sites in hundreds of stores, and they also open Habitats sites since they bought both chains two years ago – for which the company claims to have increased food sales and made the acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to redesign its sites for beauty and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury made a joint experience with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's outlets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 sites of Celesio, which is the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there they claim that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing a wide range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-X, sales director of Sainsbury, made the following statement: “We have transformed the appearance and character of our beauty stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We have also invested in special training for our colleagues, who will offer professional advice on the ground.
The range of brands offered by us aims to meet every taste and all needed in a charming setting with convenient location, and this combination makes us an attractive destination for beauty products, which challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones was furious after Holly Willoughby refused a £11 million deal.
Dragons star Peter Jones "has become angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby has given up a £11 million deal with his lifestyle company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for brand household appliances and accessories Truly.
The couple's business is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of "This Morning" has announced her leaving in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones "to boil" after withdrawing from their lucrative brand business for lifestyle at the last minute – and to focus on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones "was angry" when the "golden girl" on TV admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts -- worth up to 1.5 million pounds, meant that there would be no time for his brand of household products and accessories Truly.
The business is similar to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, with rumours that it has doubled Willoughby's wealth, whose value is forecasted at 11 million pounds.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram his departure to Truly, Jones left Britain by plane to head for one of his vacation properties.
One of the sources said: “Truly was definitely Holly's highest priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to ensure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave the boil absolutely everyone completely unprepared.
No one believed that this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
At Marlowe headquarters, there's a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of "This morning", which is one of Britain's most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to the large investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household products, and could also lead to delays in placing the brand on the market.
And last but not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby herself founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman of the company in March.
The two families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the "messenger" of the M&S brand and will also replace Ann Mcparlin as the host of the ITV "I am a celebrity".
A source close to Jones last night made the following statement: "We will not comment on his business affairs."
Tough negotiations leading to "warming relations"
He joked about the criticisms he would take from the news channels for commenting, which someone would consider "not suitable for the president" and as too positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in his humorous "news" way.
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first meeting took place in Singapore in June and Trump was declared "a big step towards eliminating North Korea's nuclear weapons".
But the negotiations to eliminate this weaponry are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Jung Ho, told UN General Assembly officials that North Korea "does not see reciprocal attitude" on the part of the United States towards its country's first steps on the path of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the US continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relationship with North Korea is wonderful," he noted.
"We were going to war with this country.
Millions of people would have died.
Instead, we now enjoy a wonderful relationship."
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results -- termination of missile tests, release of hostages and return to home of the bodies of American servicemen.
He also defended his unorthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It is extremely easy to act as president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to enter this crowded area, we would have about 200 people right there," Trump said, pointing the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island and led to the death of hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok of foreign NGOs, it was declared that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for the initiation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, an unequivocal opinion is expressed that international assistance is not required, which makes things slightly challenging," Mrs Sumbung said.
While "Save the Children" is forming a team to head to Palu, it is still not certain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the territory of the country.
The national spokesman for the disaster agency, Mr Sutopo, announced that the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the reconstruction efforts.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this kind of natural disasters.
Although shelters were built in Achech in the event of a tsunami, they are not a common view on the other shores.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu may have contributed to the loss of life, even though a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the numerous Indonesian islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this logistics even more.
Until recently stationed in Lombok for service, the victims of the earthquake have headed for Palu, but it will be at least three days before he can reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Wido has turned the improvement of Indonesia's backward infrastructure into the centre of his election campaign by investing a large amount of money in roads and railways.
However, insufficient finances are constantly harassing his cabinet, while Jocko is heading back to the polls next year.
Mr. Jocko is also under pressure caused by ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands forced to leave their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons.
Look: Daniel Sturridge brought a late draw for Liverpool vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal in 89th minute this Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27 to 28 meters from Chelsea's door, while his team was 1-0 behind.
He set the ball on his left leg, then fired a precise shot at the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penalty field and headed to the top right corner of the net.
She transferred the plunky Kepa Arisabalag and entangled himself unscathed into the net.
"I tried to take a good position to master the ball because players like Shaq are always looking for forwards, so I just tried to earn as much time as possible for a good shot at the door," Sturge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I pushed my ball and I just fired without much thought."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute after her Belgian star Eden Azar's goal.
The attacker of the "blues" passed with a fifth to Mateo Kovacic, then sprinted from the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
Kovacic exchanged a quick double pass downtown.
Then he dropped a quick shot pass, which led Azar to a clean position in the criminal field.
Azar outrun the defenders and scored with his left foot in the far corner past Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 this Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be Videoton in UEFA League Europe at 3:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths following the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people are trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which struck the country on Friday and led to waves up to 20 feet high, news conference spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugrojo reported at the news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 people, is littered with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old male on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation was initiated after this morning in Berkenhead, Mercyside discovered a woman's body.
The remains of a 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds on Grayson Mose on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of the murder.
The police are asking for assistance from everyone in the area who has seen or heard nothing.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan made this statement: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I am begging all those who have been near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially cab drivers, who may have filmed something with the cameras on their tray, to contact us, as they may have vital information to investigate."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found on private property.
This afternoon, a group of friends who consider the woman to be their acquaintance arrived at the scene and asked where she was found in the morning.
The investigation continues, with the police announcing that he is now informing the victim's relatives.

Cromwell's parliamentary statue becomes the newest memorial hit by "rewriting history"
Its ban will be poetic justice for his almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts that were committed by his fanatical puritan followers.
But "The Cromwell Society" described Mr Crick's proposal as "madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of Cromwell's Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's to Westminster Palace became a goal.
The iconology of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be made a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent performance by Sir William Hamo Tornecroft is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of historiography of a figure that many still consider to be worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph this: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, and of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century that shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognisable person who represents one side of the division that has occurred.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of commemoration and celebration."
A killer pig wounded a lethal Chinese farmer.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his last name as Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pigsty in the Leupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farmer prepared to inject his pigs with vaccines in May 30, 2005 in Sinin of Qinhai Province, China.
Supposed to have arrived with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also found the door to the next pigsty open.
He also reported that there was a big male pig in the pigsty with a bloody snout.
Forensics has confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked the farmer, the report reports.
"My cousin's feet were bloody and mutilated," says Cousin Wu, quoted by Guyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so he couldn't attack anyone else while the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It is also reported that Yuan's family and market leadership are negotiating compensation for the death.
Although rare, pigs that attack people have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, as after the attack the man suffered critical injuries.
Ten years before that, 650-pound pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive him away.
After a Oragonian farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
"They're just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... not meant to hurt anyone.
But even one should treat them with respect," the man ends.
The weakening hurricane Rosa will lead to frequent and heavy rains in the southwest US
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as she moves over the cool waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will lead to flooding rains in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa includes winds with a force of 85 miles per hour, which is a category 1 hurricane, starting at 5 a.m. Sunday morning east time and located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a sinclinal begins to form, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture deep northward towards the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will lead to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching sinclin will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid floods, suffered debris streams and likely landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will cause precipitation from 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain locations, especially parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest are expected from 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially over most of Arizona.
There may be lightning floods in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to travel a handful in the desert when a threat of tropical rain is imminent.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to dust and violent winds.
The approaching sinclinal will lead to heavy rains in some parts along the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach precipitation of over half an inch, which will lead to small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the rainy season.
On late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain reaches a larger area in late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
October may bring large temperature fluctuations to the United States, while the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There's about 20 degrees of temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to raise and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October, with temperatures around 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast expected to prevail.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the fascinating spectacle of the testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blacy Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which took place in the 1980s.
During this time, political opposition continued, with the networks interrupting their regular turnaround programmes in the last minutes of Friday: an agreement that was arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake and according to which the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that she was 100% convinced that Cavanaugh was making out with her drunk and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Cavanaugh, in his devoid of emotion, is absolutely certain that such a thing has never happened.
It is likely that even more than the number reported by Nielsen of 20,4 million viewers saw the testimony on Friday.
The company has counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediately available data on the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also Nielsen traditionally has difficulty measuring the number of people who watch from their jobs.
For comparison, we are talking about an audience similar in size to that of a championship football match or the Hollywood prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose leading supporters strongly supported Kavanau's appointment, was the first among all 5.69 million viewers on average during the full-time hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to the report by Nielsen CBS had 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After a declaration from the office of the moderate Republican that he would vote in favour of Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras filmed him booing protestors Friday while trying to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judicial Commission.
During all the harassment for a few minutes, he never lifted his eyes off the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I am right here, standing before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he presents the truth to the state?
"You have power, while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Flake said his office had already issued a statement, and before closing the elevator doors, he announced he would make an additional ruling during the hearing by the committee.
Cable and broadcasting networks provided a tight live coverage a few hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer Cavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate's attention.
But Flake said he would only do that if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominee next week, which the Democrats insist on in opposition.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the senator of the Democratic Party Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Fleck made a decision.
His choice was definitely essential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political play" with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political play" with Britain's future and of undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on her so-called "Lady Game Plan" for Brexit, saying that the collection of UK customs fees for the EU and vice versa is "totally absurd".
The police arrested suspect Dittian Simpson for the death of the LSU player.
Police arrested a suspect in the final fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dittian Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department reported.
Officials presented a video of Simms-Simpson confrontation, police reports Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson's DNA on them, report from CBS WAFB's affiliate.
After Simpson's interrogation, police reported that he confessed to the fatal shot against Wade.
His bail is set at $350,000, notified by Advocate.
The Department of Forensic Medicine of East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report Friday, indicating a gunshot wound to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The police department thanked the Luiz police's fugitive search department, the police crime lab, the Southern University police and the locals for the aid they provided in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
LSU athletic sports director Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for "timely justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The six-foot-and-six-inch player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
On average in the last season he achieved 5.6 points and 2.6 ricochets per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "broken down" and "in shock" after Wade's death.
Wade said that "this is something that worries a person all the time."
Volcano spreads ash over Mexico City
The ash thrown out of the volcano, Popocatepetel, reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater activity has risen and 183 gas and ash discharges have been recorded in the last 24 hours.
The Centre has observed numerous tremors and tremors.
Pictures published on social networks show a thin layer of dust that covers the windshields of cars in some of the neighborhoods of Mexico City, for example in Hokimilko.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in the volcano's activity, which is 45 miles southeast of the capital since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in a clash with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona Saturday after protestors for independence clashed with the gendarmerie when thousands joined opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote to break off Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not admitted by the gendarmerie, began to throw eggs and paint at the peacekeepers, creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets that are usually crawling with tourists.
Later in the day, there were other fights with the police, and the police resorted to their batons to master the situation.
For hours supporting independence groups cried "We do not forget, we do not forgive", while those who declared themselves to preserve the integrity of the country responded with "Spain forever".
The local press said that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical assistance for minor injuries.
The tension remained high in the eligible independence region even a year after the referendum held on October 1st was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vast majority voted for independence, although activity was low, as most opponents of the secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in the polls in the region with a number of violent clashes.
The independent groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Nevertheless, the demonstration took place, but she was forced to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer has hope of Catalonia's chances of independence.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now it seems we are stagnant," the man added.
Despite the significant victory, whether with a small difference, in the regional elections in the last December, supporting the independence of Catalonia political parties are having difficulties this year, as many of their most famous leaders are either self-imposed or arrested in anticipation of a trial because of their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his phone a police-support protest, claims the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
His comment is that "it's getting more tense."
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders arrested in anticipation of a preliminary trial last year, announced he would run for European Parliament elections next year.
He argues that "my application for the European elections is the best way to resist the regression of democratic values and the repressions that the Spanish Government has observed".
Londonderi: Arrested men after a car crashed into a house
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39, respectively, were arrested after a car had repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderi.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard Crescent Thursday around 7:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings has announced there's been damage to both the gate and the building itself.
It's also possible that a crossbow was fired on the car.
Menga's goal brings Livingston's 1-0 victory over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston provided victory.
Premier League rookie Livingston surprised the Rangers and only lost Steven Gerard in his first 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's goal turned out to be crucial, and Gary Holt's team tied to points with the second in the Hybernian standings.
Gerard's team remains undefeated in the Premier League this season, and next Sunday, they face the leader, Harts, who is eight points behind.
But before that, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has already been in a series of six games without losing in the championship, and manager Holt still hasn't tasted the loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed good opportunities against the idle guests.
Holt's team had to lead in the score long before he scored the goal, and his direct style of playing extremely difficult Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke defense, but his shot went sideways, and then Alan Litgow fired along the beam after Craig Halckett turned the ball head to him.
The hosts let the Rangers play the ball, knowing they could seriously make it difficult for the guests to get into static situations.
And that's how it got to the winning goal.
The Rangers committed a violation, and Livingston played well, like Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined each other and took Menga out, who led the ball and scored from the middle of the penalty field.
Up until now, the Rangers had more control over the ball, but they faced the impenetrable protection of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This style of play continued during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
The Rangers' goalie saved Scott Pittman's kick with his foot, and a blow to Litlow's head passed the door after another static position for Livingston.
In the penalty field of Livingston, the centered ones fell, which were easily cleared, and the judge twice ignored the claims of the guests for penalty – first after the match between Halket and the Glen Middleton Reserve, and then in case of doubt of hand play.
“Phenomental” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland of "Tony Macaroni Arena"
Phenomenal game and a great score for Livingston.
The team game simply superb, continuing to exceed expectations and improve performance.
The style of the game and the composition have hardly changed since the team's return to the Premier League, but Holt deserves much praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the field.
Captain Halket was amazing, organizing the defense in an excellent way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell under pressure.
At the same time, the Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, they're demonstrating some great things, but in this case, they were way below those standards.
They missed the last pass before the goal, and only once managed to split the protection of the hosts – this loss should wake up the Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), we witnessed smiles and blue expanses when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to correct the relationship between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship has cooled due to problems affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU admission.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, police prevented a 25-thousand crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, yet there were still many supporters around who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to allow it into the country.
The various protests reflect the fault caused by a visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks while being despised as a despot by others.
Road crash in Deptford: A cyclist rests after a collision with a car
A cyclist died after a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, around 10:15 AM British time.
The driver of the car stopped and medical assistance arrived, yet the cyclist died instantly.
The accident occurred several months after another cyclist died after being hit by an escaped driver on Children's Street, near a mile from the scene of Saturday's crash.
Capital police have announced that her employees are working on identifying the man, then they will notify his relatives.
The road is closed and the bus lines are diverted, and it is also recommended that motorists avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in mutiny
Six prison guards were injured in a riot in a high-security male prison, prison services reported.
The riot broke out at the Long Lartin prison in Worcester at nearly 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and still continues.
In order to contain it, special officers of the Tordano unit who will have to deal with eight prisoners, such as the riot itself in a confined wing of the prison, have been summoned.
The injured guards suffered minor injuries to the faces and received medical attention on the ground.
A spokesman for the Prison Service made this statement: “Specially trained officials have been called in to deal with the incident that occurred at Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards have received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons and we very clearly state that the responsible persons will be handed over to the police, and it is possible that their sentences will be extended".
Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after an inmate was attacked, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, riot police were called to prison to contain a heavy riot in which the staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens with a flash flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although the dried areas may benefit)
It's rare that Arizona gets hit by a tropical storm, but there's a good chance that this will happen early next week, while the weakening storm Rosa floats through the desert to the southwest, leading with it the risk of lightning floods.
The National Weather Service has already established positions against lightning floods on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different path over Finisk on Tuesday, with rain coming in late Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center provide a 2 to 4 inch rain with isolated quantities of up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest wilderness, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Big Pool, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of rain possible in separate locations.
For those who are not threatened by lightning floods, Rosa's rain may actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although the floods are extremely serious concerns, some of the rain will probably be useful, as the southwest part is currently on land.
According to the Commission for Monitoring U.S. Dry Periods, just over 40% of Arizona suffer from at least excessive drought, which is the second most heavy category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to land at the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who on Sunday morning can still boast at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets cooler waters over the Pacific and therefore weakens.
It is therefore expected to reach land at Mexico with the power of a tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of indoctrination.
"Full rains are expected from up to 6 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches," reports from weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border Tuesday early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona into southern Utah by Tuesday late evening.
"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is an extremely strong rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center warns.
These rains are expected to lead to life - threatening flash floods and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous terrains.
Assault in Midsamer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old male were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old child was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsummer Norton around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
It is placed in a hospital where its condition remains "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two boys 18-year-old and 20-year-old male, reported by Avon and Summersett police at night.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Cavanaugh "has suffered from the villainy and anger" of the democratic party
"Every vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a voice that rejects the insidious and outrageous tactics of the democratic party," Trump announced at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Cavanaugh was "injured by the vileness and anger" of the democratic party during its nomination.
Cavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, categorically dismissing Christine Lacey Ford's charge of sexual assault decades ago at the time the two of them were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the prosecution hearing.
The president made a statement Saturday that "the American people today witnessed Cavanaugh's intelligence, courage and qualities."
"Every vote in favour of Judge Cavanaugh is a vote in favour of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation in public service," the President told the crowd of Western Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Cavanaugh's nomination as he talked about the importance of republican votes for the general elections.
"There are five weeks left until one of the most important elections in our time.
Although I am not a candidate, in fact I am also a participant," Trump continued.
"That's why I'm going around and fighting to support the good applications."
Trump noted that Democrats have set themselves on a mission "to hinder and hinder".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for Cavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place not later than Friday, as CNN reported one of the collaborators of a senior Republican party representative.
Hundreds died after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, casualties are rising
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were swept away by the washed up coast giant waves when a severe earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in Palu on Friday, when at nightfall the coast was swept away by waves of up to six feet [6 feet] high, carried many to their death and destroyed everything in their path.
The Tsunami came after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately, which is why many have fallen victim to the disaster," BNPB announced during a briefing in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's Disaster Control Agency.
"The water had dragged cars, trees, whole houses, hit everything in its path," Nugroho continued and added that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed the trees and managed to escape the water," he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Published by the Disaster Agency photos from the air showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, torn down and twisted bridges, as well as a water-bound mosque.
The secondary tremors continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) issued a declaration that the energy released from Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb placed on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugrojo described the damage as "great" and specified that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, the spokesman added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugrojo said the victims and damage could be higher along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
He also added that "communications are completely crossed and there is no information from Donggala".
The Red Cross, in turn, pointed out that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers are already on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it may be even worse."
On Saturday, the agency was furiously criticised for not informing about the impact of the tsunami, although officials explained that the waves had arrived during the announcement.
Social networking amateur videos show a man upstairs screaming at people on the street panic warnings about the approaching tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall slams into the shore and takes away both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the authenticity of the video in time.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a severe power outage, which stopped communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the responsible authorities reported, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other essential products.
The urban airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Wido will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
Those who died in the Indonesian tsunami are already over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision officials from Donggala managed to get safely to Palu, where they found shelter in brezent shelters crucified in the courtyard of their office, they passed a number of scenes of devastation, says Mr Dosseba.
"They told me they've seen countless destroyed houses."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the ongoing work on rescue and recovery emergency groups, some complain that those with extensive experience in such situations foreign rescuers are prevented from reaching Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, financing, sending of personnel and supplies from abroad can only be started if the impact is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The disaster is still at regional level," said Aulia Ariani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government announces that it is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but they have not yet declared such status."
While the second night of the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those who are still missing continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones have somehow survived natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandonno, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped in the Roa-Roa hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi added.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa Hotel reached the Paragliding community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to the players in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue bookmarks, however, the only response to his messages was a single gray one.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he added.
Thieves steal $26, 750 while loading an ATM in Levi's Newport.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26, 750 from an employee of Brink, who was loading an ATM at a Newport in Levi, it became clear from a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM at the amusement complex and was preparing to load it with money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While the man was busy, another man "came running from behind the back of Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses have noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, the announcement continues, but police have not identified the number involved in the theft.
Anyone with any information on the identity of the suspects should contact the NYPD at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of the Twitter change on Saturday, he also wrote: "The man officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has for some time been named Ye and has been using it as a title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change precedes his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He changes singer Ariana Grande in the show, which gave up "for emotional reasons", the creator of the show tells us.
In addition to abbreviating his current professional name, West has previously claimed that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you' or 'you'," West said earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with the radio-leading Big Boy.
"This way I am you, I am us, it is us.
It passed from Kanye, which means only one person, just Ye – which is a reflection of the good in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our essence."
The rapper is one of many known in its sphere, who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and names, including Puff Dadi, P Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preferences for the nicknames Leo and Brother Leo.
One of West's previous associates, J.Z., also presented himself in a dash or no dash and/or capital letters in his nickname.
The president of Mexico swears not to use the army against civilians.
The newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore he would never use military force as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
President Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolko Plaza "never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people, while student movements with left political views gradually spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador swore an oath to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening more free public universities.
The President also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attracts young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. has to double the financing of the A.I. development
At a time when China is becoming increasingly active on the front of artificial intelligence development, the US needs to double its research budget in this area, says EI researcher Kai-Fu Loi, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various units of the US government made statements on the AI topic, although the US as a whole does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan as early as last year: the country seeks to become the number 1 innovation in the AI by 2030.
"The doubling of the AI budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the US and are about to make further breakthroughs regarding the AI," Lee said.
Double funding can also double the chances that the next major AI achievement will come from the United States, as Lee informed CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book "The Super Powers of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest companies for AI in China – Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon Lee University, he worked on an AI system that beat America's most successful player, then was CEO at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee paid tribute to the previous technological competitions of the federal government, such as the robotics competition of the Advanced Defense Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next one would be to help identify the new visionaries.
"The researchers in the United States often have to work hard to gain government funding," Lee said.
"It is not China that takes away academic leaders, but corporations," the man said.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university lights to work on AI.
Lee also argues that changes in immigration policy can help the United States strengthen its AI programme.
"I believe that doctors in EI sciences should be automatically offered green cards," the man said.
The US State Council announced its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding for people from academic institutions like the way the National Science Foundation and other state organizations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint AI Center, which aims to include industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Special AI Commission.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, there are currently more than 100 million dollars invested annually in the development of the AI.
Meanwhile, the US legislature, which wanted to set up the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not seen any activity in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum whether to change the name of their country
Macedonia's citizens voted in a referendum this Sunday whether to change the name of the state to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia". This is a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocks Macedonia's EU and NATO membership.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name is a claim against its territorial integrity, which is why it vetoes its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he himself would not vote in the referendum, while a boycott campaign casts a shadow on whether the referendum will be able to reach the minimum 50 per cent required to recognise its validity.
The question of ballots reads: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, which include Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the Yugoslavia-based state of Macedonia into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to give my voice for the future of the country, for young Macedonians, so that they could live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough Members of parliament have said that they will comply with the outcome of the referendum to such an extent that the vote already has a decisive burden.
In order to change the name of the state, two thirds of parliamentary representatives must vote for this.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 afternoon.
However, turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters visited the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Guyose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and arranged chairs in front of tents stretched by boycotting referendums.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads held proudly, not through the door for servants," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead to investment needed for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is over 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he cast his own voice.
The statesman also said that the positive result would lead to "confirming the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published survey results, according to which between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum -- which is below the required activity.
Another study by Macedonian TV Thelma announced that 57% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they would vote "Yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow against pro-Western government policy since it won power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes through Brighton's entire defense and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City a 2-0 victory on Saturday at Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Playing Aguero for his naked in 65 minutes seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine scorer was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He outrun three defenders from Brighton before sprinting the ball into empty space forward.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He snuck past one of the defenders, then left the rest behind at the border of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he passed left to Sterling.
The English striker with one touch brought the ball back to Aguero, who, with a right foot, overcame Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his door.
"Aguero is struggling with some injuries at his feet," City Pep Guardiola's manager told reporters.
"We planned for him to play for about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky you scored a goal at this very moment."
But Sterling was the one who provided the original advance of the "heaviest blues" in this match from the Premier League of England.
He signed in 29 minutes.
In the naked situation, Aguero got a pitch deep into half of Brighton.
He immediately dropped a forward pass on the left flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sanne made progress with the ball, then found Sterling with a pass on the far beam.
The attacker of the "heaviest son of a bitch" managed to pick up close, shortly before the ball went out.
City will face Hofenheim in a match of the Champions League group phase at 12:55 on Tuesday afternoon at Rain Neck Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play fix the fate of Rockies
Since the Nationals didn't qualify for the playoffs, it doesn't make much sense for another match for a starting pitcher.
Yet always ambitious Sherzer hopes to be the winner on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, if the match is relevant to the Rockies, which lead with a match in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West ranking.
Rockies guaranteed participation at least in the Wild Card match after winning 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is still not certain that they will win their first division title.
"Although we ourselves are not fighting for anything, we want to finish the season with a nice match in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win the perhaps most important match for them during the year.
Why would I want to miss a game like this?"
Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but are supposed to allow Sherzer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Sherzer, this would be the 34th match as a starting pitcher this year, as he held a workout on Thursday and would have the normal rest time by Sunday.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump recruits supporters in West Virginia
President Kosso hinted about the situation with his Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh, while talking about the importance of republican votes in the general elections.
"In November, everything we have achieved will be at risk.
Five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the biggest moments in the current history – I also say that although I am not a candidate, in fact I am also participating, that is why I am fighting with all my strength for the right applications," Trump said.
Then he went on with “You all see this scary, terrifying radical group of democrats, you see them with your eyes.
They are determined to regain power in any way, you are witnesses to their ruthlessness, to their malice.
They don't care when they can hurt, who they have to run over to cling to power and government, because they are only interested in power and governance, but we will not give them."
Democrats, according to the president's words, have set themselves the goal of "to hinder and hinder".
"What we have all seen in the last four days," he continued, calling Democrats "angry, nasty, vile and unfaithful".
The president reminded of the Senate Judicial Commission, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which caused loud booing from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you distribute the document?
I'm sorry, what?
No, no, I waited – that was a really bad sign – probably the worst I've ever seen".
The Labour are no longer open-minded.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I am just the last member of the Labour Parliament so far, who was declared not welcome – just because I speak frankly.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she was determined to confront anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship has criticised me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics which are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy disagreed during the time of previous leaders.
The notice on the meeting of Labour members from Nottingham East on Friday said that "we wish the meetings to include everyone and be fruitful".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, Friday's meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and the promises of a "lighter and more measured" policy have long been forgotten if they were ever on the agenda.
It became increasingly obvious that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion was judged on the basis of how much the party's leadership liked it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I worked for before considered to share similar political views began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would never agree with - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I actually say – there is a whole insulting tirade in social networks, where it is called for recall, rejection of moderate politics, statements that I do not belong to Labour.
Like this doesn't just happen to me.
As a matter of fact, I know that I have even been more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments for me are, at least, mostly of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purposefulness of those colleagues who face sexist or racist flips every day without being intimidated by them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer open-minded, with any sign of distrust or change of the rules of choice becoming more narrow-minded.
Over the past two years, I have received many advices to keep quiet, not to talk so much, and that “everything will be fine. ”
But that's not why I joined politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student provoked by Thatcher's government, which through its neglect led to a literal breakdown of my excellent school, I fought for better public services for those who need them most – either as a local advisor or as a minister.
I have never hidden my political views, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way from my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state heads for Brexit, it will harm households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the Labour chief.
But really, my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labours or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of recall or political excommunication will refuse me to act in the way I consider best in defence of your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Undefeated Air Leads to Ranking
The two late essays may have changed slightly the final score, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match from the Premier League of Tennent.
The team is already leading the ranking and the only one of the ten teams is without loss so far.
Better protection and better use of opportunities proved crucial in the match, from which coach Peter Murchi and his team can be very pleased.
"I am happy because the other teams tested us quite seriously in the past matches, and we are still without loss," Murchi noted.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations about Air really took advantage of their situations better than us."
Grant Anderson's essay in 14 minutes, followed by a successful additional blow by Frazier Climo, brought Air forward in the result, but a yellow card for the Scottish National Rory Hughes, released to play in the Wariers game, allowed Melrose to catch up after Jason Baggot realized an essay followed by a failed addition strike.
Klimo increased the lead for Air from a penalty strike shortly before halftime, marking an essay after a solo action, and then implementing the additional blow, which made the score 17-5 for Air's break.
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful additional blow by Baggot, reduced the lead to just five points.
There was a continuous stop of the game due to a severe injury of Ruarid Not, which was carried out on a stretcher, and after the renewal of the match Air increased their advance after a Stafford MacDoual essay and a successful additional blow to Klimo.
Then the acting captain of Air Blair MacPherson received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage, exerting strong pressure and implementing an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by a failed additional blow.
However, the hosts regained the presence of the spirit, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after he knocked down Klimmo without a ball, MacPherson carried out an essay with the help of Air's advanced offensive line.
Climo realized the extra shot, and not long after he did it again, after Kyle Row caught David Armstrong's kick ball and took Gregor Henry's wing out on the flank for the fifth host essay.
The star of Still Game seems to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business.
The star of Still Game Ford Kiernan seems to be heading for a more direct and warm industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular show, which he is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars, along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last for the show, as it appears that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from comment, although a source from Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was planning to join Glasgow's "prolific restaurant business".
"The Sea Is Ours": Bolivia's Sealess Hopes the Court Will Reopen the Way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the rigging naval headquarters in La Paz all the time.
There's an ocean blue flag flying over public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are adorned with the motto: “The sea belongs to us by right.
It's our duty to get him back."
In all Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost outlet passed on to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century, is still alive – as well as the call to sail again in the Pacific.
In fact, this hope is currently the strongest in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting judgment by the international court on October 1st, after five years have passed in consideration.
"The power is in Bolivia, there is a sense of serenity and unity everywhere, and the country expects a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadila.
Many Bolivians will watch the judgment of the international court on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's claim and that after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Evo Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is due to face a controversial re-election battle next year, has also bet a lot and a lot on the judgment of the court on Monday.
"We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific," Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the possibility that the court will make a decision in favor of Bolivia is quite small, and even if it decides in its favor, that would not change things in reality.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands does not have the power to take over Chile's territory and has ruled that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the international court is only six months after the hearing of the last arguments, points out that the case "is not complicated", recalls Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may actually have hurt her.
"The problem of access to the ocean has been swelled by Bolivia's current government," Zarate said.
Then he hinted that Morales' warlike rhetoric had wiped out Chile's little remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult after what has happened to have a normal dialogue.
The two countries have not maintained diplomatic missions with each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
According to him, on Monday Bolivia will have "an incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relationship with Chile", as well as a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefits for both sides".
Kalzadila also rejected the idea that Morales -- who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America -- used the problem of ocean access as a "political crutch".
"Bolivia will never give up her right to go out to the Pacific," he added.
"Decision is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome our past problems."
North Korea claims it will not continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his country will never proceed to nuclear disarmament first unless it is able to trust Washington.
Ri presented his speech Saturday to the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep the promises they made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of relaunching the deadlock diplomacy on the nuclear issue more than three months after meeting in Singapore with Kim Young Un from North Korea.
Ri called "empty hope" the idea that continuing with the sanctions and objections of the United States for a declaration to end the Korean war would make the North fall to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture on the path of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second date.
But there is widespread skepticism that in Pyongyang they are serious about their refusal of an arsenal, which they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest scream on massive hats that will soon be in the fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun's rays, you don't need to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown revealed a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection that amazed the fashion podium during Paris Fashion Week.
Pretty impractical hats caused a wave in Instagram in the summer, as designers sent their eye-catching creations to amaze the fashion community.
Valentino's protruding proposal was an extravagant beige hat with feather-like broad periphery, which literally swallowed the heads of the models.
The other too large accessories included jeweled watermelons, magic hat and even pineapple – but they are not meant to keep warm on your head.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had their lips sewn up and reminded not so much of high fashion as Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled diving equipment in a complete set of snorkels and glasses, while another looked like a melted cone of ice cream.
If you're into fashion trends like this, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats will soon be sold in fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come very soon after La Bomb – the straw hat with a two-foot periphery, which was seen on everyone's heads – from Riana to Emily Rataykovski..
The cult of the extremely impractical hat, which took over social networks, led to the emergence of another huge design of the fashion podium – a straw beach bag, almost as big as the wearing it with a bathing suit.
The bag of raffia with the color of a burnt orange, with rhizomes and a handle of white leather, was the all-seeking item in the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus during Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitide told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – after the designer has made such a big impression, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic distinction, which continues in 2018 with another superb performance of the exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports disciplines, art, music and other social sciences.
With up to 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can draw up and implement a personal curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, your words can reach them.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year's exams, we see that languages come first with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved the high A score.
The data collected from 74 members of SCIS schools shows that 72% of students have achieved a Chinese A rating, with 72% of students studying German, 69% of studied French and 63% of those with Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland perceive foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
At the moment, languages as the subject of free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural-mathematic disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in the programmes of independent schools and beyond.
A study conducted in 2014 by the UK Commission on Employment and Employment Skills showed that, from the reasons employers have difficulty finding employees, 17% have indicated insufficient linguistic competence.
Therefore, more and more knowledge of foreign languages becomes mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require the mastery of a foreign language, which makes these skills essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person masteres a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future after mastering such a skill that remains for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the master of several languages ahead of the competition.
According to a study by YouGov, among more than 4,000 adult UK citizens in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to conduct a language, with the French being the only language whose mastery reached a two-digit percentage with an indicator of 15%.
That is why investment in language learning today is important for children now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will differ from taught languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important to the UK in future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, and teachers will be specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed in life, regardless of what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country, which requires this to be taken into account in the educational system.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered to be "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools
LeBron's doing his Lakers debut this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are eager to see LeBron James' first game with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will take part in the first preseason team match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still unclear how many minutes he'll play in the fight.
"It will be on the field between one and 48 minutes," Joke Walton announced through the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel announced on Twitter that James would probably play a relatively small amount of minutes in the match.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of the Lakers preseasonal training.
"At this stage of my career, I do not need preseason games to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of election rallies tonight in Welling, West Virginia..
This is the first of the five Trump rallies planned, which include stops in familiar places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By postponing the confirmatory vote on his choice to fill the seat in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress in the November vote.
At what time will the Trump rally take place in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Welling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m., Eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Welling, West Virginia, below by broadcasting live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to review this week's hearings about Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh, in which tension arose over allegations of immoral sexual activity, which held the Senate's confirmatory vote within a week while an FBI investigation was under way.
However, the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November elections.
Therefore, President Donald Trump's campaign announced that these five rallies next week aim "to activate volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Congressional control is so important for his programme that the president will visit as many states as possible and start a campaign season full of commitments," a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who refuses to be mentioned, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Welling, could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Trump's second visit to West Virginia will take place Saturday, in which he won by more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Western Virginia Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissie that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological research," said Simon Heather, a political scientist from the University of West Virginia, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team will fight to the last, keeping their hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without the intrigue "foursom" matches on Sunday afternoon may have brought what Ryder Cup needed.
Changing the advantage in sports is a very subjective concept, in which, however, players believe unreservedly, even more in races like this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They led by six points, and now there are only four, so I guess we have gained some momentum," Jordan Spite said at the end of today's race day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage with only twelve more to distribute.
As Spite says, however, Americans have more to show and their fans must not lose hope if we have to judge by the sports form of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Speed shows excellent shape from the beginning to the end of every hole and is the real leader of his team.
Fan cheers were getting stronger as he progressed in the round in which with a precise strike he evened the score in the fourth match, after he and Thomas were two strokes behind the first two holes.
His blow, which won them the game of the 15th hole, was met with strong enthusiastic reactions that make us believe that really not everything is lost for the American team.
"The important thing is not to think about anything else and focus on your own match," said Spite.
That's all those players have left now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Speed and Thomas in the last two days have been Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed heroes of Ryder Cup so far.
The strange but delightful couple from Europe won four out of four, and it all seems to be working out for them.
Mollywood was the only couple who didn't make "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they didn't have "gods" either on Saturday morning or Friday afternoon or in the morning.
These successive successes, as well as the way they seemed to pass energy between them and enthusiastic fans, have confirmed the view that they are the players who will win on Sunday and there will be no better pair than Fleetwood and Molinari, which will bring Europe's potential victory while the sun sets over “Le Golf National”.
Preferably both of them at the same time on different holes.
However, the talk of European fame has proved a little premature.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the "fourball" games from this morning, while he was partnering with Alex Norén.
"Boghe" and two "Double" of the first nine holes put the Spaniard and Swede into problems that they could not cope with.
In Sunday games, however, no one else can solve your problems.
"Fourball" and "foorsom" matches are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they exchange with each other and the way in which a strategy can undergo changes at any moment.
The Europeans played better teamwork and therefore gained a significant lead before the last day, but this session of "foursom" matches showed that the US team is also ready to fight to the last – something that many people, especially in the United States, strongly doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid lead before Ryder Cup's last day after leading the United States by 10-6 after playing the games from the "fourball" and "foorsom" formats on Saturday.
The inspiring duet Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari began with two victories against the inconclusive Tiger Woods, with which their asset in the Le Golf National race rose to four points.
In an attempt to win back the trophy that had been lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated the morning "fourball" matches over the Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and ultimately Europe won the series with 3-1 wins.
The United States put up more resistance in the "foorsom" matches, where they won two victories, but failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furrick's team needs eight points from the 12 singles on Sunday to save the trophy.
Flitwood was the first rookie in Europe to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known as "Moliwood", after this sensational weekend became only the second couple to win four points of their first four games in Ryder Cup's history.
After unappealed outplaying Woods and Patrick Reed in the "fourball" matches, they were extremely motivated to defeat the defeated Woods and the American rookie Bryson Decambu with an even more definite score of 5/94.
Woods, who barely went through his two games on Saturday, only occasionally demonstrated outbursts of genius, but so far he has lost 19 losses from 29 games in "fourball" and "foursome" matches, as well as seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who received a break for the morning's "fourball" games, partnered with Henrik Stenson in the "foursom" clashes with 2 & 1 over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copka, respectively number one and number three in the world.
The team of Europe, however, failed to enjoy a completely pleasant, cool and cloudless day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas gave the Americans back their hopes by winning two points on Saturday.
They achieved a difficult victory with 2§1 against Spaniard John Ram and Jan Polter in the "fourball" matches, and later returned to defeat Polter and Rory McElroy with 4&3 in the "foorsom" meetings, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, a team has happened to catch up four points of deficit before singles, and according to the regulation, Furrick's team will hold the trophy even in equality.
However, after being outplayed in two consecutive days, it seems their chances for a turn on Sunday are not very high.
North Korea says "there is no way" to disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korean Foreign Minister told the UN on Saturday that continuing sanctions deepened distrust of the United States and there is no way the country would abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the world organisation, Ri Young-ho said "significant measures of goodwill have been taken over the past year", for example, stopping nuclear and missile testing, destroying the nuclear test site and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without having confidence in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security and under no circumstances can we disarm ourselves first."
While Ri was expressing North Korea's known complaints about Washington's resistance against a "staged" approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded because it had taken step-by-step measures, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim promised to work for "nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula", and Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States says that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists "first to remove nuclear weapons" and increase pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal through coercion, and even oppose "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us fall to our knees is a meaningless dream of those who do not know us.
The problem, however, is that the continuing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting was planned between Kim and Trump, for which the US leader stressed through the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister focused on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-In over the past five months and added: "If the country on the issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, the elimination of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a standstill.
However, Ri's tone of speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that directing North Korean missiles to the mainland of the United States was inevitable after "the evil president" Trump called Kim "a man-missile" on a suicide mission.
This year, in the UN, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with "total destruction", praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said a lot of work remains to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea eliminates nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there is no deadline for this and said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must necessarily continue until full, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is carried out."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop financing Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly couloirs and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress was made, but just a few hours later North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has promised to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "the appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that "the appropriate measures" he seeks are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wants to achieve normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students on a course for enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year caused all students to sleep more in an effort to fight the growing culture of learning "all night" with the help of caffeine.
A teacher found that students at number one university in the world often don't even think about it when it comes to the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Keysler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, has prepared a course he thinks is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the day, a girl came to me and said, "Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?"
She said that no one ever talked to her about the importance of the dream that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to the students the most important thing about how good sleeping habits help academic and sports achievements, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Bareira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
A one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is an image of a room in a dorm where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to explain to them the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are influenced by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of bedtime routines.
Another part of the participants tells how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke," Professor Kaisler added.
The culture of pride from "learning all night" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Providing adequate and quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says – even in order to avoid getting fat, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Keysler prepare a course by taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says his course "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step is for all graduates to be asked to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Keysler recommends that students think about setting a bedtime and wake-up alarm and knowing the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can upset the circadian rhythm and lead to falling asleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal crushed Gerard's team
The Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's jester crushed Steven Gerard's visionless team and brought a 1-0 victory to Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory as a guest from the February triumph with 4-1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only suffered Gerard's second defeat in his 18 games as manager, which left his team eight points less than Harts' break-out team, a leader in the Ladbrokes Premier League.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the devoid of constructive ideas team of the Rangers at no time seemed close to leveling.
After the game, the Rangers have fallen into sixth place, and Livingston is now third, lagging behind the second Hibernian only by the naked difference.
For the Rangers there may be additional problems, as side judge Callum Spence received a head wound after being hit with an object that was apparently thrown by the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that defeated Air in the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came up with the same 11th of Livingston who pulled a point against Harts last week, and he should be happy with the way his aggressive team paried all of the opponent's actions.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston did better in the rarer cases when they owned it.
They were supposed to score the second minute Menga brought out Scott Pittman with one touch against goalie Alan McGregor, but the quarterback missed a good opportunity.
Later, a center of Keegan Jacobs from a foul found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgow turned the ball aside from the back beam.
The Rangers took control of the game, but they failed to create anything meaningful in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there should be a penalty in 15 minutes when he confronted Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only hit two straight shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily dealt the Lassana Kulibali head and the weak shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livy's hit at 34 minutes was surprising in view of the ball's possession, it was totally deserved.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' deep concentration.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher took the ball to Scott Robinson, who passed in cold blood to Menga, for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacted to the break by replacing Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this shift almost immediately resulted in a result when the wing passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the impact.
Livingston, however, continued to force guests to play in a host-friendly style of play, such as Litgow and Halket constantly pulling the long balls sent forward.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the last few minutes, but MacGregor managed to deal with Jacobs' strike, and with the subsequent Corner Litgow, he fired his head around the beam.
The one who entered as a reserve, Glen Middleton of the Rangers, requested a penalty at the end of the match after the match with Jacobs, but Thomson again saw nothing wrong with the situation.
Yearbook: Geiger counter inventor
Page from our yearbook Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROENE... the day when future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hance" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as a Geiger counter.
A cornerstone of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become the cornerstone of pop culture, when in 1950 the film "The Bells of Coronado", which was attended by seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: “What on earth is this?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure he's giving a shit right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to “see” foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to “see” foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory
Then they can “see” a protein that is common to many cancers and are injected back into the patient
The test vaccine showed promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who trained the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many types of cancer called HER2 and then re-injecting them into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: "The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal carcinoma, explained Prof. Berzofski.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “training them” how to target cancer cells was used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat labeled "Let's make America Great again" when he participated in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was booed at the studio during Saturday Night Live after doing a pointless performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song of the evening called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat marked "Let's make America great again," he declared himself against the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
"Very often I talk to white people and they ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began the Matt Damon show, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Legal Commission for Sexual Violence Complaints made by Christine Blaisey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, the recording of West's performance was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear why Rock tried to mock West with his publication.
Besides, West complained to the audience that he had problems backstage because of his hat.
"I've been terrorized backstage.
They told me, "Don't go out in that hat."
I've been bullied!
And then they claim I'm on a sinking ship," he said Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the sinking ship?", claiming that it will put on Superman's suit, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try love."
The comments provoked at least twice the booing from the audience and members of the SNL team seemed embarrassed, Variety said, one of them said, "The whole studio has quieted down."
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle "Perrier".
West received the support of the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest: THANK YOU for MEETING THE BULLET."
However, the current-leading show Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "she was herself and that's wonderful."
“But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his “art”), whom I think welcomes and distributes an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That's what we are," she added.
Before the show, the rapper reported on Twitter that he had changed his name, now "known officially as Kenny West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he follows Didi's example, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didi.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lyon, and musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol.
Charge of attempted murder after stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place at Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Magistrate's Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be dealt with by the prosecution.
Kit Harrington, the star of Game A Throne, is against toxic masculinity.
Kit Harrington is famous for the role of John Snow's sword in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO Game of Thrones.
But the actor, who is 31, declared himself against the stereotype of the macho character, saying that showing such roles on the screen leads to young people often thinking that they should be "hard" in order to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admits that she feels “hardly convinced” that this problem must be resolved.
"At the moment I am personally convinced – what have we done wrong in terms of masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach growing men about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to many manly characters.
He continued: “What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught by television and on the street that makes boys feel that they should become this particular type of men?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
Because obviously something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in a prestory or continuations of "Play of Thrones" after the end of the series next summer, claiming that he had "completed with the battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit will play in the reenactment of Sam Shepherd's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing that happened in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so that's how he gave me my future family and defined my life from now on," he said.
Rose plays Playit, the girl Kit John Snow's character falls in love with the fantasy show that won the Emmy Award.
They were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
According to health services in the country, more than 820 000 people have been affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual intercourse, which marks a change compared to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly to some parts of China as a result of a transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, China's health services said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, every year the number of those living with HIV and spin in China increases by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997 homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in KGB communities is widespread.
According to studies, because of conservative values, 70–90% of men who have had sexual relations with men end up marrying women.
Many of the cases of disease transmission are due to incorrect protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged to provide universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leak of Republican party senators, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, US House of Representatives member Maxine Waters condemned the allegations that a member of her team had published personal information of three state senators from Republicans on the Wikipedia legislators' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were made by experts and ultra-right wing sites.
"Liars, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a hearing of the Senate's composition on charges of immoral sexual conduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh.
The leak occurred after the three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications is linked to Waters' office and released information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
"This unfounded statement is completely false and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – is in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded statement is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked criticism online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"There is anger in this denial," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that it does not have the temperament suitable for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
He shouldn't be challenging.
I shouldn't question the accuser's motives.
He needs to be calm and balanced."
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the criticism by the Democrats of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused by critics of also looking angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters' place in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Amenly, if it is true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said her office had called on the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
"Johnny English Blows Up Again" review – the weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for references to Brexit in any new film with British participation and it seems that this also applies to the revival of action comedy, spy franchise for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and returned in 2011 with "Johnny English is back".
Will the self - laugh and the mimics that speak of how obvious it is that we are stupid become a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with eyeballed eyes and a " rubber" face has the permission to renew things for the second time – his name is the most important when it comes to a great comic creation designed for movie fans who do not speak English.
He is, of course, a foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of flattering brilliance, owns a little of Clouseau, a little of Mr Bean and a large part of the man who contributed with a note to the music theme Chariots of Fire at the 2012 opening ceremony of the London Olympics.
In addition, it was originally based on the leaving chaos behind a traveler and an international man whom Atkinson played in the already forgotten TV commercials of Barclaycard.
In the last movie with Johnny English, there are either two good moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing medieval armor and for a while the fins clinked into his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy and obvious, but humor is quite weak and strangely unnecessary, especially when "serious" film brands such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humor seems more focused on children, not adults, but Johnny English's wacky accidents, in my opinion, are not innovative and focused, as Actinson's net game reminds Mr Bean.
Always the current prerequisite is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker hacked into the British super-secret spy network and revealed the identity of all operatives for the terror of the agent on duty – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and pompous figure and already suffers from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this quasi-Thereza-May role, but there is nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that she needs to summon a retired agent, as all active agents have been compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a teacher at a chic center, who, however, illegally teaches lessons on how to be an undercover agent: there are some good hits here when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English was summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former longtime assistant, Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, a hilarious role in which Vicky Pepperdin's talent is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's secret services and face the fatal beautiful Ofelia Bouletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the creepy Jason Volta played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their odyssey of farces: disguised as waiters, set fire to a French restaurant; create chaos when they sneak into the luxury yacht of Volta; and English provokes true anarchy when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to get to know the interior of the Volta house.
All the jokes are certainly taken from the previous film, but since they're so cute and violent, there's a lot more content here for children.
It's a pretty mediocre production.
Just like in other Johnny English movies, I keep thinking, can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labourers deny that they're developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to receive a pay for five.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is considering a radical plan, according to which the British will work four weeks, but receive a fee of five.
The party says it wants company bosses to provide savings made through revolutionary artificial intelligence (III) to workers by giving them another day off.
She wants the workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but to receive the same pay.
Sources say the idea would "save" the economic programme and the party's plans to shake the country in favour of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been approved by the Unions Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A top source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected before the end of the year to be reported for a policy review.
"It will not happen immediately, but the four-day working week is an aspiration that fits into the approach of rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as in the party's common industrial strategy."
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its joint election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this aspiration does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not in party politics is not considered by it."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr MacDonnell said he was determined to take power back from the "personal directors" and "speculants" in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that the current ownership of shares in water supply companies may not receive their full share, as the Labour government could impose "restraints" on the basis of established violations.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on the board of companies and create privatisation funds to transfer 10 percent of the net capital of private companies to employees who can accumulate annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy are talking in front of "60 Minutes" whether Cavanaugh's investigation by the FBI could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed his final vote on the Supreme Court nomination by at least one week and raises the question whether the bureau's findings could have prompted some of the Republican Party senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelli asked Republican Party senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after that statement came out, and I asked him, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, unequivocal and unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion about Brett Cavanaugh and in order to change it, a shocking accusation is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has categorically denied it," Graham added, addressing Christine Blasius Ford.
"And no one she mentioned but could confirm it.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive composition of performers and performs an equally impressive mission: the eradication of poverty around the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the big lawn in Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, but will also get acquainted with the real purpose of the event – the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty project, an international protection group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or actions such as voluntary participation, sending no email to a world leader, telephone call or otherwise to help raise awareness about their poverty eradication goal.
But how successful is Global Citizen 12 years before achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genius way to be convinced to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clitivism" – people think they are doing something significant when signing an online petition or sending a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, "Global Citizen" has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who insist on many different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, which have already paid or collected at least 10 billion dollars.
The group considers that the funds provided have already had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", established in Britain a partnership between investors and performers, engaging in "helping children develop their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 posts on Twitter from "global citizens".
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition simply into a historical note," Ambassador Tracy Ulman told the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions have been taken that call on Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, "The Power of Nutrition", which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of his FAQs on his website, asking, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
"Global Citizen" replied: This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail and still fail.
But just like in the big movement for civil rights and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers of this year's New York event, which will host Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use naval forces to “block” and hinder energy exports – Interior Minister
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products entering the markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Interior Minister Ryan Zink, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zink argues that Russia's engagement in Syria -- particularly where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government -- is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just as they did in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that the maritime roads are open and, if necessary, block them to make sure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink addressed the attendees of the event, organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, which is presented as the "voice of energy users" in the United States.
It aimed to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
"The economic option with regard to Iraq and Russia is more or less stimulating and replacing fuels," he said, while at the same time describing Russia as a "one-number pony", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with strengthening the export of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said turns Berlin into "a hostage".
Moscow stressed several times that the $11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's zealous opposition to the project is dictated simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the point of view, energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position triggered a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (DBDI), urged the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look" at the 2020 presidential run, says the Massachusetts senator.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "look seriously" at the presidential run after the midterm elections.
During a city council in Holyoke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It is time for women to enter Washington and fix our broken government, and this includes a woman at the top," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will take a serious look at running for president."
Warren expressed his assessment of President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he "leaded this country in the wrong direction.
"I worry to the core of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank in her criticism of Trump and his candidate for Supreme Court Brett Cavanaugh.
On Twitter on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A poll conducted Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren's own voters do not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this application.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, 38 percent for and 48 percent against.
Other senior representatives of the democratic party, discussed in terms of potential running in 2020, include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points to Truck Palin AKP at Donald Trump rally
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"What my own son is going through after returning is familiar to other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming home with," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they return a little changed, hardened, return and wonder whether they will receive the respect that they themselves and their brothers in arms have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence of a woman, included in a report on domestic violence and possession of drunk weapons, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Vasila Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and D.C. are in favour of a court dispute over a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims of gang violence and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from the 18 states and the county filed a goodwill request in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions case, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August, has not been disclosed.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of violent members of his gang" abused her, but US officials rejected the asylum application on July 20th.
She's being held in Texas.
U.S. lawyers helping Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, as nations facing comprehensive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy returned the decision of the 2014 immigrants' appeal board, allowing immigrants to apply for asylum.
D.C. attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "failed decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined according to the specific facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates this principle," the goodwill report said.
In addition, lawyers argue in the report that the policy that refuses entry of immigrants is damaging the American economy, pointing out that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "to provide the necessary labour."
In June, chief prosecutor Jeff Seciones ordered the immigration judges to suspend asylum for victims fleeing home abuse and gang violence.
"A sanctuary is given to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a specific social group or political beliefs," Secios said in his 11 July policy announcement.
The sanctuary has never been intended to alleviate all problems—not even all serious ones—that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, while deaths doubled during search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her sick boy in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance carries more corpses.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake are overcrowded.
Some of the victims, including Dvi Harris, who suffered spinal and shoulder fractures, were placed outside Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing aftershocks.
His eyes are filled with tears when he recalls how he felt the severe earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was cornered in the ruined wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that he came to town with the family to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "harassment" with "propagand ads"
One week after an official newspaper in China launched a four-page advertisement in an American daily about the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American propaganda press.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid publication in Des Mines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of seeking to intervene in the November 6th elections.
Trump's accusation that Pecky is trying to intervene the elections for the US Congress, noted what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to launch commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently taking part in an escalating trade war in which they equalise import tariffs between countries.
Experts from the US and China said at the beginning of the trade war customs tariffs in China were intended to hit exporters in a state such as Iowa who support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstadt writes in a comment in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is currently doubling this harassment by launching propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In the spread of its propaganda, the government of China has benefited from America's respected tradition of freedom of speech and press by launching paid advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"In contrast, at the newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see a real reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese people may have regarding China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media are under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He adds that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish" his article, although he does not specify exactly who.
With Kavanaugh's defeat, Republicans repel voters women for midterm elections, analysts warn
As many of the high-ranking Republicans stand behind and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh in connection with several sexual assault charges, analysts warned that there would be a response, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around this tray are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue with a vote.
These things cannot be returned back," said Grant Raher, professor of political science at Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Raher said he was doubting whether the last-minute insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it either tomorrow or November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington's newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to proceed with Cavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr Christine Blasius Ford, said Mick.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded," Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news.
"People say the problem is already serious; this is true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among the voters women in the suburbs and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years, who often don't vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her charges of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggest that a response may follow if Republicans insist on confirming the candidacy.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Cavanaugh is put on the stand. It is about the way Republicans deal with it and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect democrats, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided on who to trust as a result of Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, with a little more leaning towards the second.
A new sociological survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
Besides, 38 percent say they think Cavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent say the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence at the moment, the FBI is investigating Ford's allegations, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavanaugh assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals to her while they were at a party during her studies at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee begins an enterprise that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the Berners-Lee Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the intention behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said regarding the venture.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own “online repository of personal data” or POD.
It contains lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify that are available through each browser, and at the same time all of them simultaneously.
The unique thing about the online repository of personal data is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it "the granting of authority over personal data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the CEO of the company John Bruce, is to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developers who signed a project contract, and a group of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, or not, when all their business models are fully updated overnight.

Bernard Van: In memory of the priest awarded Victoria Cross in World War I
It was celebrated for 100 years in the hometown of the only English priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross for his participation in war during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without realizing that he had been honored with Britain's highest military honors.
A memorial monument was inaugurated Saturday by his two grandchildren, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" to open the monument exactly 100 years from his grandfather's trial, awarded a medal.
According to London Gazette on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very thick fog and under heavy fire from artillery and machine guns."
Later, he attacked the line of fire and with "the incredible bravery" he marched forward before attacking an artillery cannon with one hand and killing three of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do, but it makes me humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Van placed a wreath after the parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was "a great honor to participate in the parade" and added "the valor of the true hero is demonstrated through the support that will be provided to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead received Peppa Pig
Imagine that you've been waiting all night to watch a full edition of Bellator 206 and you can't finally witness the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six of the main map and had to be broadcast live in the UK at night on Channel 5.
At six o'clock, just as Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain were stunned when the show changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after being up until the early hours, especially because of the fight.
A fan described on Twitter the switchover of the children's animated film as "some kind of sick joke".
"The government rules that at 6 o'clock this content is not appropriate, so the program was replaced by a children's show," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communications, in response to a broadcasting question.
"Peppa pig," yes."
Company President Bellator Scott Coker said they would work on planning meetings to include UK viewers in the future.
"In my opinion, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," said Coker.
"There, however, it is six in the morning on Sunday and there is no way to plan for the event to take place here on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received a lot of messages and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't like that. He was government.
I can promise you next time that won't happen.
We will stick to including five fights instead of six – as we usually do. We tried to give more to the fans, but we went too far.
This is an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt "lower" due to his sexuality
Olympic Jumper in Water Tom Daly says he grew up feeling lower than everyone else because of his sexuality – but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started studying in secondary school, he didn't realize that "not all of them are like me."
In an interview with the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he talked about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he became less interested in winning the Olympics.
The permanent host of the longtime show, Kirsty Young, is on sick leave for a few months.
When he was participating in Laverne Daly's first program, he said he felt "less" than everyone else when he was growing up, as "it was not socially acceptable to like girls and boys."
He said: “Until today, the feeling of inferiority and the fact that I am different from others are actually the things that give me the energy and the power to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that it was "something", he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year's British Community Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he was happy to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to inspire “hope” for others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man, the American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - surprised him.
Daly married Oscar's winner, who is 20 years older than him last year, but claims the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much while you're so young," he participated for the first time at the 14th Olympics, and his father died of cancer three years later," he said, "it's hard to find someone your age who has experienced such ups and downs."
They became parents in June and had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daly himself said that "his whole world view" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that all I care about is winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said that his father could not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 Olympic Games in London – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't be there for me, Dad, or in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and at that moment when I found out he was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that all my life I dreamed of jumping at the Olympics in front of the audience at home. There was no greater feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song – “Proud” by Heather Small – which accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympic Games and still makes him shiver.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15, British Summer Time.
Lost form Mikkelson stays on the bench for Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mikkelson will set a record Sunday when he will play his 47th match at Ryder Cup, but he will have to regain his old form if he does not want his record to be linked to failure.
Mikkelsson, who participated in the two-year event for the record 12th time, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furrick for "fourball" and "foursome" matches on Saturday.
Instead of being the main player of the US team again, the five-time winner of major tournaments spent his day as a fan and in training his long-distance hits in the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who even at the top of his career was never among the most straight players, is not in optimal shape for the difficult court of “Le Golf National”, where the long rough terrain usually punishes every wrong blow.
And if the court itself isn't disturbing enough, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mikkelson will face the precise British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who is teaming up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and trying to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind the 12 singles, make a strong start, it may be that the Mikkelson game is absolutely crucial.
Furrick expressed confidence in his teammate, although he could hardly say anything much different.
"He fully understood his role today, patted my back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furrick said.
"He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given as much as in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing in just two games.
I expected him to play more, but it just worked out, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else."
Mikkelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most matches in Ryder Cup, played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career at Ryder Cup, which has never come close to his impressive individual achievements.
Mikkelsson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equal matches, but Furrick said his presence brings other benefits to the team, which are not measured by numbers.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for every team," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the big lead could soon be melted.
The captain of Europe's team, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the big lead gained before the singles from Ryder Cup's last day can be easily erased.
The Dane debuted in the game of "Valderrama" in 1997, when the team with Captain Seve Ballisteros led by five points in front of the Americans, but right at the finish line was almost caught and barely managed to hold the victory by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead on Valderrama; we had a big lead on Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama we won, but very difficult," Bjorn said after Europe's 2018 team won 5–3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, leading by 10–6 of Le Golf National:
So the story has to show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
Be ready for attack tomorrow.
Go out and do what you have to do.
It's not over until you see the final score on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try and win this trophy, and that's what we need to stay focused on.
I've been saying all along that I only think about the 12 players on our team, but we're also aware of our rivals, who are some of the greatest players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of the players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never rush the celebrations.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, individual performances will come out in the foreground, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, then you test your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message that must reach the players: tomorrow you must do your best.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he must also be given to the end."
Unlike Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furrick will ask his players to perform better individually than as partners, with exceptions being just Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
Furrick himself was on both sides of these big gays on the last day – he was part of the triumph of "Brockline", and then he was on the losing side when Europeans performed "The Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Krenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to make the same good start you saw on "Brockline" as on "Medinah".
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches are played under tremendous pressure.
So we formed our group and distributed our boys as we wanted to, to try to do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with leading our counterattack and facing Rory McElroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Polter will meet the other Europeans in the upper half of the arrangement.
"I chose these players in this order because I think this gives us the best chance of success," Bjorn said about his choice for singles.
Germany puts off again the launch of a new battleship
The latest frigate of the German fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 in order to replace the outdated battleships of the Cold War, but this will not happen until at least next year due to failed systems and shelling costs, local media reported.
The introduction into operation of Rheinland-Pfalz, the brand's leading brand ship, new frigates of Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, who quoted an army spokesman.
The sailing court was scheduled to join the naval forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace obsolete frigates of class Bremen.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, e.g. reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest frigates should be able to be used up to two years before returning to home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that advanced warships -- which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power across the ocean -- will be old when they get into operation, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate frigate F125 entered the headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to put the vessel into operation and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned a ship to shipbuilder after delivery.
It is little known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware defects" that make the warship unusable if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws are particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class craft will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older frigates in the Bremen class.
In addition, it turned out that the ship was significantly overloaded, reducing its efficiency and limiting the ability of the naval forces to add future superstructures.
The 7000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is considered to be twice as heavy as ships in a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
Besides defective hardware, the cost of the whole project – including for crew training – also becomes a problem.
It is believed that it has reached the stunning 3.1 billion euros (3,6 billion dollars) -- of the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest frigates become particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet was in fact "exhausted from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said that the problem has become bigger in time, as the old ships have been decommissioned, but no new ones have been made available.
He complained that no frigate of Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the fleet.
The National Trust follows the secret life of bats
A new study carried out in a mansion in the Scottish mountains aims to establish how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hopes are that discoveries will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help lead future conservation actions.
Research by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow the common bats, as well as the brown Strelly Water Nightwear in Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations on the estate to track the activities of bats during the season.
Employees of NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's call sounds, as well as which species produce them.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Duar, the NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by any species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and in Britain as a whole declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to habitat loss.
The risk to populations may be from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles along their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The Trust has trained experts who conduct regular studies, inspections of shelters and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first bat reserve in Scotland and the only special bat reserve in the Treave estate in the Dumfrees and Galloway area, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
The estate manager David Thompson says it's perfect territory for them.
"Here in Treave, we have great terrain for bats," he noted.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and completed a suitable habitat.
But there are many other things about bats that are not known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
It emphasises that it is important to check for the presence of bats before carrying out property maintenance activities, as it is possible the unintentional destruction of an asylum to kill up to 400 female and young bats, as well as to destroy an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish employee at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our animal species, because we just don’t know what’s happening to their populations.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape, and his lawyers are suing a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people "want to become famous" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was charged with rape of American Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is said that he then paid her $375 000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a Instagram video, turning to its 142 million followers, a few hours after the announcements were published, the 33-year-old Ronaldo condemned the publication as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is fake news," the five-time gold ball bearer told the camera.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain popularity on my back, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the football player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they call "unacceptable publication of suspicions in the field of privacy", Reuters said.
Lawyer Kristian Shertz said the footballer would demand compensation for "moral damages corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is said that the incident in question occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the football player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her that he was a "good boy" to "99 percent", but in this case he simply succumbed to "one percent".
According to the records, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that happened with her consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court agreement because she felt "h horrified with revenge" and was afraid not to "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she's willing to cancel the agreement as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident in question.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian Grand Juventus for the sum of 100m euros.
Brexit: Britain "will regret forever" losing car manufacturers
Britain "will regret forever", if it loses its status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worried" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at their plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of the border slowdown in the event of Brexit without a deal could result in job losses.
At the plant in Bournaston – where the Auris and Avensis models are produced – last year nearly 150,000 cars were produced, 90% of which were exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, voiced concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says they will close their factory for the Mini model in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks to the supply chain in cases of Brexit without a deal.
Toyota's production line works on the "right on time" principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers from both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there may be problems at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait more than one day to complete their inventory at the factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and therefore production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's "shahmat" plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to seize this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio's 4's Today program.
"After not only Toyota's claims but also other producers' claims, we are absolutely convinced that we should be able to continue to provide successful supply chains."
Toyota cannot say how long production will be stopped, but in the longer term warns that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite Union at the plant, said his members are increasingly worried: “From my experience, if these jobs go away, they will never return.
A spokesman for the government said: "We have laid out a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House says.
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed with another week", as the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Cavanaugh continues to fight, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian intervention in the elections, ties between Trump's and Russia's assistants and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy prosecutor or not, and thus endangers Mueller's independence, he's been feeding the Washington rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times announced that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this claim.
But last Monday, he went to the White House after reports of his resignation.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting was announced with him on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not to" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the hearing before the Senate legal committee, which both Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blaisey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI of complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
When she was asked a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set for this week, but seeing all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court, I think it might be postponed until next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would argue this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10th.
The host of the show, Chris Wallace, asked for the reason.
Sanders said that rare press conferences are not due to animosity to the "demonstrative behavior" of television journalists, although he said: "I cannot say that I disagree with the fact that they have a demonstrative behaviour."
Then she hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is conducting more questions and answers than any president before him," she said, adding, without quoting evidence: "We checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but "if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, this is far better than talking to me.
We try to do this a lot, and you are witnesses to practice it quite often in recent weeks, and this will replace the press conferences, since you have the opportunity to speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting top officials.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and at times strange behavior in front of the gathered journalists.
Health Minister addressed EU workers in Scotland's National Health Service regarding Brexit fears
The Health Minister addressed in writing EU personnel working in the National Health Service of Scotland to express the state's appreciation and desire to remain in place after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months left until Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to the costs of established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “In the summer, the negotiations between Britain and the EU on leaving continued, with solutions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also progressing in its preparations for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain period for all of you.
I would therefore like to remind you how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
Members from all over the EU and beyond contribute with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is beneficial to patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is unconditionally your home and we would very much like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after he suffered head trauma.
Tennessee State Tigers' Linebacker, Christian Abercrombie, had an emergency surgery after having a head injury during Saturday's meeting, when his team lost the Vanderbilt Commodores by 31-27, according to Mike Authority of Tennessee.
Tennessee State Senior Coach Rod Reed told reporters that the trauma occurred shortly before halftime.
"He went to the sideline and somehow just passed out there," Reid said.
Coaches and medical professionals gave Abercrombie oxygen to the sideline before he was put on a stretcher and taken to the locker room for further examination.
Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details of the type/seriousness of the trauma" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the trauma occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore on a college scholarship, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five roadblocks before leaving the match, making a total of 18 blocks for him this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp levy when buying real estate in the UK
According to new conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp levy when buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the stamp levy will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects an increase of over 120 million pounds per year, which will help the homeless
Teresa May will announce today the decision of foreign buyers to pay a higher stamp levy when buying real estate in Britain, with additional revenues going to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promising more affordable housing and targeting people with high income.
The promotion of the stamp levy will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional revenues supporting the government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The addition – which is an addition to the current coat of arms levy, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for dedication purposes – can amount to up to three percent.
The Treasury expects the proceeds to rise by up to £120 million per year.
About 13 percent of newly built buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the UK, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for individuals who buy property for the first time to intervene in the property market.
Many of the rich districts -- especially in the capital -- have become "ghost cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time abroad.
The new policy appears only a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the stamp levy to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by looting land, but not using it, and asked Ms May to abandon affordable housing quotas to repair Britain's "hospital disgrace".
Mr. Corbin announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reforms, including rent control and the end of the "no guilt" expulsions.
He also wants to give the councils greater powers to build new homes.
Ms May said: "Last year I shared that I would like to dedicate my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream – the life of every new generation to be better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who wish to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for individuals who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, to buy housing as easily as the hardworking citizens of Britain.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has gone too far in time, and the insult of sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to lead the Scotland team"
Sunderland's manager Jack Ross said that "the greatest ambition" of his career was to be the senior coach of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman accepted the challenge to revive the club from north-east England, which is currently in third position in the First League, three points from the first place.
He crossed over to Stadium of Light this summer after last season he took St. Mirren back to the Scottish High League.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded a match for the B team and that was it," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsround.
"But I grew up with the Scotland matches of Hempden, which we watched together with my father as a child, so the national team has always attracted me.
"However, this opportunity would only be opened if I had success on a club level."
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland include names such as Dick Advocate, David Moiss, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poet and Paolo Di Kanio.
Aloa Athletic's former mentor said he was not concerned as the successor of such established names in such a illustrious club, and before that he rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, success at the moment will be measurable with a positive answer to the question "Can I return this club to the Premier League?"
Because by structure, basis and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the Premier League," he said.
"It will not be easy to go back to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross has only been a manager for three years since he spent some time as an assistant at Dumbbarton and 15 months at Hart's coaching headquarters.
Then he helped Aloa not to fall into the Third Division and turned St Miren from a falling team into a Championsship winner next season.
Ross shares that he now feels more comfortable than during his football career in Clyde, Hartleypool, Volkerk, St. Miren and Hamilton Academy.
"I was really at a crossroads," he remembers when he took Aloa.
“I really believed that being a manager was the best job for me, including being an active player.
It sounds weird because I was doing well, making good money, and having some significant success.
But being a player is hard sometimes.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still facing the same levels of stress and pressure at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I'm really doing it, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin in my entire adult life."

The perfect time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals research
The summer heat increased the revenues of the struggling British pubs, but gained more tension for restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 percent in July, but revenues in restaurants dropped 4.8 percent, statistics show.
Peter Martin from the business consultant CGA, who compiled the statistics, said: “Because of the long solar weather and longer than expected Britain's participation in the World Cup, a similar model such as June followed in July when pubs reported growth by 2.8 percent, but restaurants received an even stronger blow.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
The pubs and bars for drinks reported the best results in their height compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
Food pubs also suffered from sunny weather, but not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks jumped 6.6 percent in the month, while in food there was a 3 percent reduction."
Paul Newman, from recreational and recreational analysts RSM, said: “These results continue the trend we noticed at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the service sector outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a drop in sales by 4.8 percent on an annual basis can be particularly painful in addition to permanent costs.
The long hot summer could not come at a worse time for the managers of the food establishments and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring the desired rest."
The overall growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly discovered ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand deployment.
Coffee Peak Tracker, the sales analyst in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of over £9 billion, and is an established indicator in the industry.
One in five children hides a secret social networking profile from their parents
One in five children – some at 11 – has a secret social network profile, which he hides from his parents and teachers, revealed a study
A survey conducted among 20,000 high school students shows a rise in fake Instagram pages
News has raised fears that sexual material is being published
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" profile that they show to their parents
One in five children – some in 11 – creates a social network profile that keeps secret from adults.
A survey among 20,000 high school students shows growth in fake Instagram accounts – a reference to Instagram photo-sharing site.
News has raised fears that sexual material is being published.
Twenty percent of students said that they have a clean "main" profile, which they show their parents, while also having secret profiles.
A mother who stumbled across the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage child who encouraged others to "rape him".
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC of independent schools found that 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 have two profiles, with half of them confessing to keeping their profiles secret.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It is worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eileen Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on the Board of Athletics in Scotland.
Eileen Doyle was elected to join the Board of Athletics in Scotland as director without executive functions at the annual general assembly of the managing authority.
Doyle is Scotland's most accomplished athlete, and President Ian Beatty described this move as a great opportunity for those leading in sports to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Aileid enjoys great respect in the athletic communities of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by attracting it," Beatty said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help promote sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-and-400-meter finals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, adding to his four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator at the BBC, lost his ability to walk after having a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I achieved a complete recovery, learned to walk again, and today I am doing mobility training!
Thank you for the encouraging announcements!"
Breast pump ad that compares mothers to cows, divides online opinions
A company producing breast milk pumps splits online opinions with advertising that compares nursing mothers to cows that are milking.
To mark the placing on the market of the expected “first silent milk pump in the world, suitable for carrying”, the consumer technology company Elvie launched a joke music video advertising to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives to breast-feeding women to show.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn full of hay against the background of a song with text including: "Yes, I milked, but you don't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not a udder, it's my breasts."
The chorus continues: “Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk my friends. ”
However, advertising published on the company’s Facebook page caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying it undermines the "horrible" of the dairy industry.
“It is a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth," wrote someone.

Another comment: “It is understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast-feeding pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone added: "So inadequate advertising."
Others defended advertising, one woman admitted that she considered the song "extremely amusing".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breast-feeding.
Draining it made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I accept it the way it is.
This product is genius," someone wrote.
Another comment: "This is a ridiculous advertisement aimed at mothers who are cleaning themselves (often at their jobs or in the toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not an advertisement praising or condemning the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they danced with the discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and is collected discreetly in a breast-feeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, to keep their babies and even to go outside as they drain.
Ana Balarin, partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, commented: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative marketing.
By drawing a parallel between breast-feeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to milking and all the challenges associated with it, while showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that will bring the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has hit the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the podium for designer Martha Yakubovski using the product.
Hundreds of migrants' children moved secretly to a palace camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children jumped sharply, although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because acute rhetoric and policy by the Trump administration made it difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Usually, most guardians are immigrants without documents who are afraid to risk staying in the country if they want to identify a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other family adults should provide fingerprints, and this data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wished to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of the persons who are either guardians or members of the family of guardians who reside illegally in the country, most of them being foreigners-criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these individuals," Albens said.
In an effort to cope more quickly with the registration of these children, authorities have imposed new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as was the previous norm, according to shelter officials.
Many appear in a video conference conversation, not personally, to present their case as legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will become depressed or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter officials and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as the one in Tornillo, where the signs that a child has problems are more likely to be ignored because of the scale of the place.
They added that moving children to the “palatian city ” without giving them enough time to prepare on an emotional level or to say goodbye to their friends may exacerbate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges US, France, Turkey's "occupation troops" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muwalem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign troops are illegally residing on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism and "the appropriate actions will be taken towards them".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he said at the meeting.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions have been forced out of their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian lands were cleansed" by both terrorist organizations and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 servicemen in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish troops and Syrians, opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the land of the war-ravaged country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said the conditions are bearable and can return, accusing "some Western countries of "spiring baseless fears" that move refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to these returns," he said.
"They turn into a political issue something that is entirely a humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given to the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to stop the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel fortress in Idlib is enabling progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russia-backed Syrian forces over the province, where three million people live.
Mualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and voiced hope that the military action would be directed towards jihadists, including fighters from Al-Qaeda-related Al Nusra front, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of the new committee, composed of members of the government and the opposition, to draw up a draft of the post-war constitution of Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem laid out the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "a review of the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump to win a second term
By this logic, Trump will win a reelection of the 2020 elections, unless – as many viewers from the Liberals probably hope – his presidency is not suspended prematurely because of impeachment and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the primetime rating has doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during primetime, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show is at the top of the cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers at big news evenings.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," says Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC's "Last Candidate" drama, where it's about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skovel, who is veteran stager of comedies and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneeking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, "Why?"
Mrs. Skovel told me that he said, "Because he makes me laugh."
There's fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe vs. Wade, whether immigrants' families can reunite, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, the desire to be an informed citizen does not correspond to watching a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book "Fear"; Paul Manaforth's flight jacket for $15,000 (a dress full of arrogance" according to Washington Post), and the startling descriptions of Stormy Daniels about Mr Trump's anatomy.
I specifically will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does to make you feel like part of a reality show is to give you a little each night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Pawn Stars", with regard to changing participants and daily turns (babbling with the National Football League, praising Kim Jong Un).

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny on the north coast of Kauai, 80 degrees, but he had closed himself at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't separate himself from the TV, especially when Brett Cavanaugh had to face the Senate legal committee, and that depended on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization," Mr. Flyce told me.

Investments flow into the most controversial race in early elections for a seat in Congress
It's not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania receives a stream of money thanks to the rearrangement of the counties of Congress and hence two members for the same place.
The recently redistributed district in the suburbs of Pittsburgh points to conservative Democrat Connor Lamb, who won his place from another district in a partial election last spring.
Lamb confronts another holder, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, who stands up significantly for the new 17th.
The maps were redrawed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered in January that the old counties were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the main funding institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congress Committee on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after the difficult victory in the widely discussed partial elections in March for the 18th Pennsylvania Congress District.
The position was held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts believe Democrats have a slight advantage.
The US considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador because of its support for China, then withdrew
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heart meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella from Panama in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from Trump Organisation.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, due to "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," Heather Naworth, spokesman for the Department, said earlier this month.
But sanctions were envisaged only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about USD 140 million of aid from America to fight drugs, for development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be excruciating to the Central American state with its unemployment rate and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which served as a continuation of such a gathering last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent the influx of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, the senior management authorities specified that their wish was for the conference to take place, so effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Penns now announced that he will participate in the mid-October conference as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, diplomats say.
All three US envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strict announcements or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who wanted to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also wished to remain anonymous.
Study History
The next move could be the report by special adviser Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, with the report currently being significant evidence in the public register.
It is said that Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump conspired with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our elections.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will turn out that Mr Trump will have to report to this body, just when he is preparing to face the electorate, and perhaps before a jury composed of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here and I do not suggest that Mr Trump's downfall is inevitable – neither is that of those like him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make these choices, which will affect how long the fight will be.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to take a coup d'état against Hitler as long as the West had stood up to him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of the massacres.
The course of history depends on such crucial moments, and the relentless march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
At the moment, Americans are facing several similar key points.
What if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this paper announced that last year he proposed to secretly record the president and speculated that he was not fit for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein has announced that the story in the Times is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Cavanaugh, requested by the FBI, is not complete or fair, or if it is approved for the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the early elections for Congress if it will force Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these trials, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I believe we won't fail because I learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles at that table wearing a swastika.
With an inheritance like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to move forward from Group G of the League of Europe.
A knee injury didn't allow half-defencer Graham Dorans to play his first game of the season before the 2-2 match in question with Villareal, but he believed that for the Rangers this result could become a stepping stone to greater achievements.
"We have won an important point because Villareal are a good opponent," said the 31-year-old footballer.
"We entered the game hoping that we could win something and left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but overall equality seems a fair score.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
We're looking at Thursday, another big night of our matches in Europe.
I hope that we will be able to fight for the three points, this will be a difficult match, because they have achieved a good result in last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience, we can do our best and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely tough after everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but now things seem to be going in the right direction.
The team is good and the boys are really having fun, the workouts are fruitful.
I hope that we will be able to harness all our strength to forget last season and achieve the desired success."
Women worry about fears about their pension savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted to receive, few people discuss this with family members.
About half of the participants in a Nationwide survey share that they discussed long-term care costs with their husbands.
Only 10% have spoken to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they have not taken the steps to hold this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance sector.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not declare your wishes in advance.
Together with your counselor and your family discuss where and how you want to receive care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you with an idea of how to pay these costs.
Your decisions, when choosing a financial institution for long-term care, may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed policy of life insurance with monetary value, to help each other by covering these costs or self-insurance by your means – if you have the cash resources.
Draw up your legal documents: Deal with legal battles from the beginning.
Appoint a health care commissioner so that you have a certain confidant to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also the idea of a commissioner in financial matters.
You can choose a trusted person to make the financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are incompetent.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer the questions about medicines and allergies?
Provide these details in writing so you can be prepared.
"It is not just about the financial aspect, but also about who the doctors will be," Martin asked.

The victim couldn't see his attacker.
His injuries aren't life-threatening, and the police are trying to draw witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died from a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, authorities announced, and the number of dead is expected to rise.
Due to the interruption of communications, support organisations cannot obtain information from the Regency of Dongala, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster in Palu.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulavesi, with a population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck it.
Dongala is a regency that spans more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of the island of Sulavesi.
The regency, which is a smaller administrative region than the province, has an estimated population of 299200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of the province of central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian disaster recovery agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Tsunami attacked the western part of Dongala and in 1996, when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic "Pacific Fire Ring" and is regularly killed by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunami waves in recent years:
2004: A strong tremor on December 26th on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Acech in North Sumatra activated a tsunami wave that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Acech.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 magnitude quake hit the most populated island in Indonesia, Java, by activating a tsunami that crashed on the south coast, destroying nearly 700 people.
2009: Earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 hits near Padang city, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 hit one of the Liptawaii islands and activated a 10-meter tsunami wave that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Regency of Pidi Jaya in Acech, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time no tsunami was activated, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong tremors killed the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, more than 500 people died, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges.
Trak Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report by Alaskan state police released Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in the building for pre-prisoning Matt-Su and under an unsecured guarantee of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, certainly" when he was asked to plead, the media reported.
Palin is threatened with punishment for three class A offenses, which means he can be deprived of liberty for up to a year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He's also charged with a class-B felony, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently under review by the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of drug users in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son's aggressive behavior with post-traumatic stress arising from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died of an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
The 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication network is down, with the number of dead expected to grow in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Social networks have clips that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors from New York want the death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people died, a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It is said that Saipov, 30, used a home Depot rental truck to carry out the October attack on a bike near the West Side highway in lower Manhattan, driving pedestrians and cyclists on its way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused severe bodily damage, according to the notification of intent in connection with the death penalty claim filed in the South District, New York.
According to the court document, both charges could end with a death sentence.
Weeks after the bombing, an expanded federal court has issued a 22-point indictment to Saipov, including eight counts of racketeering charges used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of vehicles.
The attack required "serious planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out as "terrible, cruel and perverted".
"Seifulo Habibuljevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clevez, Anne-Laurie Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Early, Hernan Fellucci and Alejandro Damian Panuko," the notification said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last Southern District of New York sought death punishment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in New York in a federal case, was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after a conviction for conspiracy and espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an Uzbekistan national, showed no sense of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIL videos on his phone, the indictment says.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, the police told him.
He pleads not guilty to the 22-point indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"In our opinion, the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a sentence of guilt and life without parole will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NAJEL FARAGE has to lead Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilise the army of the people" today, during a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should "feel the pressure" -- one of Theresa May's own party members suggested he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonn, a Conservative MP, said in March in Birmingham that Britain "would have gone out by now" if Mr Farage had been secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge Mrs May faces to reconcile with the party's deeply divided ranks was highlighted by conservatives supporting the stay, who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan "Chequers", despite attacks by the supporting Brexit, the supporting stay from the EU as well.
The Allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and insist that Eurosceptics and Labour choose between its package and "chaos".
Mr. Bonn told protestors with the slogan "Getting out means getting out" in Solihil that he wanted to "put away Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr Farage should have participated equally with the others and that he should have received responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have left by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit, but we must throw away the Chequers plan."
Claiming his opposition attitude toward the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to create our laws in our own country".
Mr. Bonn rejected allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The perception that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is entirely false".
Conservative representative Andrea Jenkins also participated in the rally, telling reporters: “I'm just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists, who actually went out on the street and actually helped us to be elected.
Please drop "Chequers" and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their position when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said at the rally that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they intend to amend the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to change Brexit and we are gathered here today to say, "We will not let you get away with this."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of changing to Brexit, feel the pressure.
"We are mobilising the army of the people of this country, which has helped us win at Brexit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-managing, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, the supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists had raised flags with inscriptions "Conservators against Brexit" after the start of the group this weekend.
The Labourist Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives about the security issues of the party's application when it opened at the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can deploy the IT systems and all of Canada's technology and more and more, for smooth crossing of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren said he would "think seriously" his presidential bid.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that she would "consider seriously the possibility of running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that the representative of the Massachusetts Democrats was talking about her future during a city council in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for reelection in November against Republican State Representative Jeff Deal, who was joint chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It is at the heart of speculation that it can take Trump's post in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the City Hall building after Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it was high time "women went to Washington and repaired our damaged government, and that includes women at the top".
An arrest was made for Simms' death by the LSU.
Baton Rouge Police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was a suspect arrested in the shooting on Friday when basketball player Wade Simms of the LSU was killed.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, during a press conference at 11:00 Eastern Time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify the man who was seen on the footage.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
"Wead Simms was shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, had a gun, and shot Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without a hitch and arrested in the custody of the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
A young 6′6′′, grew up in Baton Rouge – Simms, participated in 32 matches with 10 outings last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2,9 fights per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after his team's instructions helped defeat Sebastian Fettel
From the moment Valerie Botas ranked ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions from the Mercedes team would play an important role in the competition.
Bothas made a good start from the first position and seriously disturbed Hamilton while defending his position in the first two turns, enabling Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel first made a pit stop and left Hamilton to deal with traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next lap and came out after Fettel, but Hamilton managed to overtake it after a daring maneuver and drive "tire to tyre", which forced Ferrari's driver with unwillingness to release the inner part of the track to avoid punishment with added time after he had already closed his opponent's path with a dangerous double defense maneuver on the third turn.
On top of his 21st birthday Max Verstapen started from the rear lines of the starting grid and was seventh after the end of the first lap.
Then he even led through a rather long period of competition, as he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would have allowed him to be faster at the end of the race and eventually overtake Kimi Raikonen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally he entered for a pit stop on the 44th lap, but failed to catch up enough in the next eight laps and ultimately Raykonen finished fourth.
It's been a tough day since Valerie did a great job all weekend, and she showed up like a real gentleman when she let me beat him.
The team did an extraordinary job to win the first two seats on the podium," Hamilton said.
That really was a bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally Saturday because of her claim that she did not distribute Christine Blaisey Ford's letter, which accuses Supreme Court contender Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a talk at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony to the Senate legal committee, but instead commented on how what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "evil and disgusting and insincere".
"What can happen is the good that happens the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see angry people and evil and disgusting and insincere," he said.
"When you look at publications and distribution, and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
You know what I mean?
Diane Feinstein, has it spread from you?
Do you remember her reply... did you release the document – "Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't distribute."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... no, we didn't distribute," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter with details of Ford's allegations against Cavanaugh in July, and it was spread earlier in September – but Feinstein denied this distribution happened from her office.
"I didn't cover Ford's claims, I didn't spread her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to maintain confidentiality and I kept confidentiality as she had requested."
But denial on her part was not well accepted by the president, who commented during the rally Saturday night: “I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
She may not have, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court challenger accused of sexual crimes against three women, the president said that Democrats are using allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
See dishonor, shamelessness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to regain power and control," the President said according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars got back for Friday's Elite League defeat against Belfast Giants by winning the Dundee rematch with 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants took an early lead in the game with two goals after hitting Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boolier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney tied up for the hosts before Dwyer regained Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied up for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals strengthened their victory.
This is the third Elite League victory for Adam Keefe's boys who got out of the bottom to beat Dundy in Belfast 2-1 Friday night.
This was the fourth clash between opponents this season, as the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's strike came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with Kendall McFall's assist, and then David Rutherford doubled the advance by assisting Boolier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped level with Cowney's help at 3:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break, scoring a second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard evened the odds again with a powerful blow to the door at 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the end of the second half, as he gave his best and confirmed the team's victory with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
Giants, who have lost the last four matches of five meetings, welcome as hosts Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller died to make sure hundreds of people on board an airplane could escape an earthquake.
A flight leader in Indonesia was praised as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board managed to take off safely.
More than 800 people died, and many are missing in a massive earthquake that struck the island of Sulavesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami wave.
The strong aftershocks continued to strike the area, and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Juffrey Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the track at that time, would be able to take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died at the hospital later.
Air Control spokesman Indonesia, Johannes Silate, said this decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Authorities, meanwhile, fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong was limited.
"We suggest that the number of deaths will increase, as many bodies are still under the debris, and many people cannot be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugrojo.
Waves that reached six metres devastated Palu, where a mass funeral took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring relief and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water.
There are marauders everywhere in the minimarkets."
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the International Movement of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is struggling to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia President Joko Wido arrived in Palu on Sunday and turned to the country's army: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was struck by earthquakes in Lombok, in which more than 550 people died.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reports that one person is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, which flew a plane that crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific Ocean, is now reporting that a man has been reported missing after saying earlier that all 47 passengers and crew have been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In press release Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon they could not contact a male passenger.
The airline added that they work together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in trying to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Boats of local people helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, authorities announced that seven people were admitted to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday, with everyone in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the US airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had passed the runway.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims the plane has gone very low.
"This is extremely nice," Janes says.
Janes says that he and the others managed to run through deep-to-crust water to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
U.S. Navy reports that sailors repairing a harbor nearby also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to get people to shore before the plane sank into the deep about 30 metres of water (100 feet).
The safety network data show that 111 people have died in flights registered to PNG in the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
Analyst puts out the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive.
The D.A.'s office closed its case statement this Saturday in a retrial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rawlet of the US Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rawlet said he received location data from several mobile phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interview Sanford.
Sanford stood trial Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said "that's a lie because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy is that Tellis claimed to know Chambers two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlet pointed out that shortly after Chambers Tellis' death, he deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He has erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin with its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be presented to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscientious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to provoke negative opinions about the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol argued that the hip-hop had deviated from its origins of political statements and engaging in social problems.
They want to go back to its roots and re-populate the conscientious hip-hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common are revived in Britain through performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy? !
New York nanny sues a couple after getting fired for "racist" announcement
A New York nanny sued a couple for dismissal on grounds of discrimination after receiving a wrong message from the mother, who complained that she was "another black".
The couple denies being racist, likening the demand of "extortion".
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was amazed when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, THE PROVISIONAL BLACKKOW", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman of her husband wrote in a text message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flacksman, who felt uncomfortable, fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the previous nanny, who was African-American, did not do the job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, reports New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for one day of work, then sent home in a taxi.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for dismissal, demanding the sum of $350 a day for the six-month arrangement for which she was originally hired, even though she had no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do this," she told Post on Friday, adding "You're sure this is discrimination."
In response to the claim, the couple claimed that they were not racist, adding that Maurice’s termination of employment was a reasonable act, because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," the husband Joel Plasco told Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you offended, even if it were by mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
Likening the demand for "extortion," Plasco claims his wife only gave birth two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You will attack someone in this condition?
This is not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit is still under review, public opinion quickly condemned the pair on social networks, condemning them for their conduct and logic.
Paddington publishers were afraid that readers would not feel a connection to a talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond’s daughter Karen Yankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the audience, relates about the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It's a lot of fun now that we're aware of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book for a little toy, would feel optimistic about a possible rejection of the book, adding that he met the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with mixed feelings" after his death last year.
With regard to Paddington, whom she describes as “an important member of our family”, she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
"He was a very modest man and was not a braggart," she said.
"But because you felt Paddington so real, it's like having a child who's achieved something: you're proud of him, even though it's not really your doing.
I think he kind of took Paddington's success that way.
Though it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"He kept calling to say that the situation was really bad, that he did not expect to survive," Mrs. Edna-Laperuz said.
"Then Nad called me to say that he would die in two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I told her, “Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I'll be there soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicines given to her by doctors to maintain her heart slowly cease to work and leave her system.
She's gone a while before that, and that's how it's over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing this was all happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to pull myself together."
Finally, Mrs. Edna-Laperuz, who has so far mourned the loss of her daughter, gets on a plane with the other passengers who have no idea of the ordeal she's going through.
"No one understood," she said.
"I had bent my head, and all the time my tears were dripping.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt this overwhelming sense of empathy with Over.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Grieving women put up postcards to prevent bridge suicides
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place on a bridge in Wales postcards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, from Lidney, says her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by the smile.
They always said his smile brightens every room."
However, he gave up his work before he left, and was in a "really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I am constantly worried that this will have consequences. ”
Mrs. Davis created the cards, “so people would know that there was someone to go to and who to talk to, even if it was a friend.
Do not remain silent – you must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He did not say that he felt depressed or depressed or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when the children opened their presents, he neither looked at them nor anything."
She said that this was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to cope: “This opens up a gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must move on and fight."
If you are trying to cope, you can contact the Samaritans on 116 123 (for Great Britain and Ireland) for free, send an email to Jo@samaritans.org or visit the Samaritans' website here.
Brett Cavanaugh's future is in question after the FBI starts an investigation.
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wants – an investigation of limited duration and limited scope – maybe we could join forces," Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that he feared that the commission "is falling apart" despite the confirmed over-party blocking.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their reluctance is because of the moment itself.
Early elections are only five weeks away, on November 6th - if Republicans do not perform well, their attempts to elect their representative in the highest court in the country will seriously suffer.
George W. Bush is calling senators, inviting them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush at the White House, and with his help he met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where members are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Penns to declare equality and confirm his application for the Supreme Court.
The number of fugitives from North Korea "decreases" at Kim
South Korean law enforcement says the number of fugitives from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sug, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, said there were 1127 fugitives last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, the stricter border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts demanded by human smugglers, are the key factors.
There is no official comment by Pyongyang.
Most of the fugitives from the North eventually get citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, and it is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarised area (DMZ), which divides the two Koreans.
China considers fugitives to be illegal migrants, not refugees, often forced to repatriate them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stagnation in nuclear disarmament talks.
This happened after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they basically worked for the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident of our national security and under these circumstances there is no way to disarm ourselves first unilaterally," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said he wasn't fit for Supreme Court service.
Congressional minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was too unstable to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented this during an interview this Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had reacted like this, they would have called her "hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate legal committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally rejected the allegations that he committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times he almost screamed and became emotional when he discussed his family and his school years.
He also categorically condemned the democrats in the commission, calling the allegations against him "a grotesque and coordinated attack on the person", organised by liberals who are unhappy that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi pointed out that, according to her, Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he is unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it has become clear that he is biased against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these allegations and with the way he pursues the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi denied it when she was asked if she would try to discredit Kavanaugh if he was appointed and in case the Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say it this way - if he is not telling the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only unfit to enter the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings regarding the Law on affordable health care or the Roe vs. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would reject certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to enter the court and expect us to say, "Isn't it wonderful," Pelosi concluded.
And women need to be mastered.
That's a legitimate criticism, after months and years of spreading rage, and she can't accept it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs Steinham told me 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, do you?"
She continued, “I got a huge help from a woman who was an executive director somewhere who said that she was crying when she got angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she got angry and cried, she said to her interlocutor, “You may think that I am sad because I am crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just goes on.
I thought that was genius."
Tears are allowed in anger, partly because they are misunderstood at first.
One of my clearest memories of a previous job, in an office mostly with men, is how, when I was sneezing with inexpressible rage, an older woman grabbed me by the neck – a chilling leader, which I was always a little afraid of – and she dragged me to the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they did this to you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congressman from Colorado, was working with Gary Hart in his campaign for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship on a yacht called "Monkey Business", and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why she should not consider running for president herself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they wanted was another one to appear.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves".
As she joins the campaign late, she lags behind in fundraising and decides she won't stay in the race unless she manages to raise $2 million.
The battle is doomed to failure in advance.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would only give her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
During her speech, in which she declares that she will not continue with an official campaign, she is flooded with so many feelings – gratitude to the people who supported her, discontent against the system, which makes it so difficult to raise money and to be able to turn to the voters, not to the delegates, as well as anger against sexism that she has become emotional.
"One might think that I have had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder how the media reacted.
"Someone might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my tombstone.
"She's crying"?
How the US-China trade war can serve Beijing
The first shots in the US-China trade war were deafening and, while the battle is just gaining momentum, a rift between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, launched the first warning salvo this year, taxing key elements of China's exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tensions occurred this week with the new duties affecting production of USD 200 billion (150 billion GBP) with an effective taxation of half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Each time Beijing was countering new duties by five to ten percent of US goods for $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond to every US strike and soon the second largest global economy is not expected to ignore this.
To get Washington to give up means to yield to demands, but to bow his head publicly to Washington would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinpin, the President of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure of the trade war with the US can help in the long term China with reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in both Washington and Beijing could create conditions for an economic crisis in one of the two countries is actually more dangerous than the observers had previously recognised," said Abigail Grace, a research associate on issues related to Asia to the New American Security Expert Group.
Syria "ready" for refugee return, Foreign Minister said
Syria has announced that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for assistance in the reconstruction of the country, devastated by the war, which lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem pointed out that conditions in the state are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress we have in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists to bring them back to normal.
Now there are all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living there need humanitarian aid.
Al-Muwalem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in the reconstruction of the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional support or assistance from countries that financed the rebels would not be accepted.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's team won the Ryder Cup for 2018, defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 of Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
Thus, the United States has had six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the championship crown in the tournament after the team, led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, reached the required 14.5 points that guaranteed the victory of the United States.
The star of the United States, Phil Mikkelson, who performed poorly for most of the tournament, threw his first blow to the 16th hole (with a "par" 3) in the water, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari performed beautifully in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament, reaching balance 5-0-0 since the race took place in the current format after 1979.
American Jordan Spite definitely lost 5 & 4 of the European team player at the lowest place in the ranking - Torbjorn Ole from Denmark.
The world leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 by Ian Poulter from England, for whom this is probably the last participation of Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight participations in Ryder Cup, became the European with the most points won in the tournament of all time, this year increasing his asset to 25.5 points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can raise the bowl again.
All that matters is the team and I am happy to be able to help", said the excited Garcia after Europe's victory.
He passed the baton to his fellow countryman, John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods with 2 & 1 to the singles on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, yet I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and his total balance of Ryder Cup is now 13-21-3.
Strange statistics about one of the greatest players of all time to win 14 major titles, an indicator that only gives way to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team was having a hard time all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-end golf every day of the tournament.
Team captain Jim Furrick said after the team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we cornered Europe's team.
There was a fight.
I take my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players did very well.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the US Professional Golfers Association and our Ryder Cup Committee and look ahead.
I love these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can't help but take off your opponent's hat.
We've just been outplayed."
