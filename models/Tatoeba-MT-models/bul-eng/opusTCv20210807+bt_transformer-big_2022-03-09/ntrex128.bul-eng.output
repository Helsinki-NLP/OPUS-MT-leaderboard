Members of the Assembly of Wales worry they "look like muppets"
Some of the members of the Assembly were dismayed by the proposal to change their title to "CUP" (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was prompted by plans to change the name of the Assembly to the "Parliament of Wales".
Members from across the political spectrum worry that this could become a laughing stock.
One Labour official has said his group is worried about the new name being "rhymed with Dumb and Dummy."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, this definitely has an offensive meaning.
According to one of the Plaid party members, the whole group "is not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party has indicated that his group is "not biased" towards the name change, but notes that the new name PMP has a certain verbal resemblance to "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similar to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the bill to change the name, made the following statement: "Of course, the final decision on all descriptive names by which the members of the Assembly are called will belong to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which established broad support for the Assembly to start calling itself the "Parliament of Wales".
As for the position of its members, the Commission prefers "Members of Parliament of Wales, in short "CSU", but the CUP option has received the most support after consultation with the public.
Members of the Assembly are proposing alternative options, but reaching consensus will clearly be a headache for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the draft bill on the change within a few weeks.
The Reform Bill will also include other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualifying its members, as well as the very design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they come to discuss the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has an administrative area named "Macedonia".
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim on Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is an opponent of the referendum on changing the country's name, has ruled that he will not respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the country's name is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells fall silent amid difficulties at Harlem churches
"If we look at it from a historical perspective, according to the old people I talked to, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, both are gone".
Adams shares that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in different ways," he adds.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms where everyone gathers regularly".
As for the churches, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of the assets will not last as long as executives expect, "and sooner or later they will be in the same position."
The man adds that churches can be replaced by apartment blocks where people live who do not help the other shrines of the neighborhood to survive.
"The vast majority of people who buy homes in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers get to visit them."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black neighborhood, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the years after 1930.
The building then became the property of the black residents of the neighborhood.
St. Martin's was taken over by black Christians under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is Harlem's main market street, as they did not want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building suffered heavy damage in a fire, but Father Johnson's parishioners had drawn up a plan for its restoration, in which they ordered the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's, proudly calls them "the slum bells".
The expert, who used the bells in July, has another description: "Cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical instrument".
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, has also noted that it was the first bell system in the world to be used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to the larger system at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather mentions that St. Martin's never replaced him.
What took place at St. Martin's in the last few weeks was a complex tale woven by architects and performers, some brought in by the secular leaders of the church and others by an episcopal diocese.
From the vestiary - which is the governing body of the congregation consisting of the secular leaders - wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concerns that the diocese "would be willing to transfer the costs to the vestiary", although it had no role in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about the diocese's lack of transparency.
13-year-old boy injured by shark in California lobster hunt
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while he was diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hummel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning, when he overheard the boy screaming for help and swooped in with an entire group to pull him out of the water.
Hummel first thought the child had caught a lobster and got excited, then realized how he was screaming "He bit me!
You bit me!"
Hummel says that when he got to the boy, he realized that the entire area of his collarbone had been torn apart.
"I've called everyone out of the water because there's a shark!" adds Hummel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It is not yet known what type of shark was responsible for the attack.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles spoke at a media briefing that a few weeks earlier a shark had been spotted in the water, but was judged not to be of a dangerous species.
Giles adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to her upper body.
Authorities have closed access to the coastline from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Suomi in Encitinas for 48 hours for safety reasons while the investigation is ongoing.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which, however, do not pose a danger to humans.
Sainsbury plans UK beauty market offensive
Sainsbury faces Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by opening beauty product stands at its sites where customers will be served by dedicated assistants.
As part of a significant offensive in the UK beauty market, which is valued at 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household products are declining, the largest beauty product stands to date will be located in 11 stores across the country, then if the initiative succeeds, similar ones will be found in more outlets.
The investment turn in the beauty industry is being made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on racks, until recently occupied by TVs, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
Sainsbury has said they will double the number of beauty products on offer to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space, similar to the offerings in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique makeup range so that most products can be used by vegans, something increasingly sought after by younger consumers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will trial discount programs at two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London last week, while the second will open in Sely Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a shifting focus on shopping for smaller amounts of food daily at convenient times leads to supermarkets having to put in more effort to attract shoppers.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sainsbury, has said that the outlets will look more and more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discounters Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury has deployed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also opened Habitats outlets since they bought both chains two years ago - which the company says has boosted grocery sales and made the acquisitions even more profitable.
The supermarket chain's previous attempt to redesign its beauty and pharmaceutical sites was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury made a joint attempt with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's outlets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its 281-item pharmaceutical business to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there, they claim Lloyds will have a role in the plan by providing a wide range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury, made the following statement: "We have transformed the look and character of our beauty booths to enhance the overall experience of our customers.
We have also invested in special training for our colleagues who will offer professional advice on the ground.
The range of brands we offer is designed to meet every taste and every need in an enchanting setting with a convenient location, and this combination makes us an attractive destination for beauty products that challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby's refusal from 11 million pound deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has "been furious" after television host Holly Willoughby gave up an 11 million pound deal with his lifestyle company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for the Truly brand of home appliances and accessories.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old anchor of This Morning has announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones "boiling" after pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle products business at the last minute - all to focus on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones "became enraged" when the TV's "golden girl" admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to 1.5 million pounds - meant there would no longer be time for his brand of home products and accessories Truly.
The business is likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, rumored to have doubled Willoughby's fortune, the value of which is forecast to be 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram her departure from Truly, Jones left the UK on a plane to head to one of her holiday properties.
One source shared the following: "Truly was definitely Holly's highest priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to securing her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave boiled absolutely all completely unprepared.
No one believed it could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There's a warehouse at the Marlowe plant that's full of products waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of "This Morning", which is one of the UK's most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to the large investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household products, and could also lead to a delay in putting the brand on the market.
And last but not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who has been her mother of three, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Kapp for over ten years.
Willoughby herself founded Truly with Cap in 2016, with Jones, who is 52, joining as company chairman in March.
The two families often went on vacations together, and Jones owned 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand's "ambassador" for M&S and will also replace Ann McParlin as host of the "I'm a Celebrity" show on ITV.
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: "We will not comment on his business affairs."
Tough negotiations leading to "warming relations"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from news channels for making comments that someone would consider "unfit for the president" and too positive for the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump back down so much?
Trump responded in his joking "news" way.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first was held in Singapore in June and was branded by Trump as "a big step towards eliminating North Korea's nuclear weapons."
But negotiations to eliminate this weaponry have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told UN General Assembly officials that North Korea "sees no reciprocal attitude" from the United States to his country's first steps on the disarmament path.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the U.S. is continuing with sanctions that aim to keep tensions going.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relationship with North Korea is wonderful," he noted.
"We were headed for war with this country.
Millions of people would have died.
Instead, we are now enjoying a wonderful relationship".
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - aborting missile tests, releasing hostages, and bringing home the bodies of U.S. servicemen.
He also defended his unorthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's extremely easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded area, we'd have about 200 people right over there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island and led to the death of hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told there was no need for them.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for the initiation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, an unequivocal position is expressed that international aid is not requested, which makes things slightly challenging," Ms Soumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to head to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate within the country.
The national spokesman for the disaster agency, Mr. Sutopo, announced that Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the reconstruction efforts.
Taking into account the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains still unprepared for this kind of natural disasters.
Although shelters were built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not a common view on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this logistics even more.
Until recently stationed in Lombok to service earthquake victims a hospital ship headed for Palu, but it will be at least three days before it can reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's backward infrastructure the centerpiece of his election campaign by investing a large amount of money in roads and railways.
But insufficient finances constantly plague his office as Jocko again heads into the polls the following year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands forced to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs battled the streets with poppies, bows and arrows, as well as other primeval weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge brought a late draw for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal this Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door, while his team was trailing 1-0.
He set the ball on his left foot, then made a precise shot to the far corner of the goal.
The ball flew over the penalty area and headed to the top right corner of the net.
She transferred the pongy Kepa Arisabalaga and tangled unscathed in the net.
"I tried to take a good position to master the ball because players like Schack are always looking for passes in the front positions, so I just tried to buy as much time as possible for a good shot to the goal," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the coming Kante, I pushed my ball and just fired without much thought."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute after a goal by their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The striker of the "blue" passed with a heel to Mateo Kovacic, then sprinted from midfield to half of Liverpool.
Kovacic exchanged a quick double pass in the center.
He then released a quick shot pass, bringing Hazard to a clean position in the penalty area.
Azar outran the defenders and scored with his left foot in the far corner past Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 15:00 this Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Multiple people are trapped among the ruins of the buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck the country on Friday and resulted in waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported at the news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 people, is littered with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was discovered this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman's remains were found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds to Grayson Meuse on John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of having committed the murder.
Police are asking for assistance from anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan made the following statement: "The investigation is still at an early stage, but I implore all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something with their dashboard cameras to contact us as they may have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found on a private property.
That afternoon, a group of friends who consider the woman to be their acquaintance arrived on the scene and questioned where she had been found in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing, with police reporting that they are currently informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives on Grayson Meuse tried to get home to his apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
The man was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told it would be hours before they were allowed to go home.
One of the police officers told a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She keeps saying "this is so horrible".
At 2 p.m., two police vans passed through the cordon while another van remained outside.
Police officers are stationed in the cordon watching the apartment block.
All those with information are requested to contact the Q&M MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, code 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's Parliamentary Statue Becomes Latest Memorial Hit By "Rewriting History"
Her ban would be poetic justice for his near-Taliban destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, which was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "insane" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, the chairman of the Cromwell Society, said the following: "It was inevitable that in the current debate to remove statues that of Oliver Cromwell next to the Palace of Westminster would become a goal.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the mistaken Cromwell will be made a victim by the actions of his forerunner Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent performance by Sir William Hamo Thornycroft is evidence of opinion in the 19th century and part of historiography for a figure that many still regard as worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph the following: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, to be the defender of parliament against outside pressure, of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate representation is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the mid-17th century that shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable person who represents one side of the resulting division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be commemorated and celebrated."
Killer pig fatally injures Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his surname as Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pigsty in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig breeder was preparing to inject its pigs with vaccines in May 30, 2005 in Xining from Qinghai province, China.
He is believed to have arrived with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, also welded the door to the next pigsty open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig in the pigsty with a bloody snout.
Forensics confirmed that the 550-pound pig had fatally attacked the farmer, the report reported.
"My cousin's feet were bloodied and disfigured," claimed Cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The killer animal did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so it could not attack anyone else while police were gathering evidence from the crime scene.
It was also reported that Yuan's family and the market management were negotiating for compensation for the death.
Although they are rare, pigs have been reported to attack humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, with critical injuries following the attack.
Ten years before, a 650-pound pig had nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife could drive him away.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pigs were not normally aggressive, but the taste of the blood could act on them as a "trigger".
"They're just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... not meant to hurt anyone.
But one must also treat them with respect," the man concludes.
Weakening Hurricane Rosa will lead to frequent and heavy rains in the southwestern United States
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cool waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will lead to flooding rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa includes winds with a force of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane as of 5 a.m. Sunday morning eastern time and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture deep north toward the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching synclinal will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, debris-bearing streams, and likely landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will result in rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected, especially over most of Arizona.
There may be flash floods in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely imprudent to travel a handful in the desert when the threat of tropical rains is imminent.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into turbulent rivers, and thunderstorms will cause dust to rise and gusty winds to blow.
The approaching synclinal will cause heavy rains in some parts of California's southern coast.
Precipitation of over half an inch is possible, resulting in small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the rainy season.
In late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger area in late Monday and through Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners through Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
October can bring large temperature fluctuations to the United States as the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of the dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There is a nearly 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to rise and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm beginning in October, with temperatures around 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast expected to prevail.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the gripping spectacle of Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh's testimony and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that took place in the 1980s.
During this time, political opposition continued, with networks interrupting their regular turnaround programs in the final minutes of Friday: an agreement that was arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake and under which the FBI was to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% convinced that Cavanaugh had drunk on her and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Cavanaugh, in his emotionless testimony, is absolutely adamant that such a thing never happened.
It is likely that even more than Nielsen's reported 20.4 million viewers watched the testimony on Friday.
The company has counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
No data was immediately available on the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen has also traditionally had difficulty measuring the number of people watching from their workplaces.
By comparison, we are talking about an audience similar in size to that of a championship football game or Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose anchors strongly supported Cavanaugh's appointment, was first among all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him being booed by protesters as he tried to grab an elevator for a Judiciary Committee meeting.
During all the bullying for a few minutes, he never lifted his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here, standing in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he is presenting the truth to the state?
"You have power, while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Flake replied that his office had already issued a statement, and before the elevator doors were closed, he said he would give a further ruling during the committee's hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks secured tight live coverage a few hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to decide whether to transfer Cavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominee next week, which Democrats are pushing in opposition.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several Senators, Fleck made a decision.
His choice was definitely essential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'political games' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politically playing around" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside her on the front page of the paper, her previous foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, stepped up his attack on her so-called "Lady's Game Plan" for Brexit, making a suggestion that Britain's collection of customs fees for the EU and vice versa was "completely absurd".
Wade Simms' shooting: Police arrest suspect Dietian Simpson for LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dietion Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, with police reporting that Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Officers found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After Simpson's interrogation, police announced that he had confessed to the fatal shot fired at Wade.
His bail was set at $350,000, the Advocate said.
The Eastern Baton Rouge Office of Forensics released a preliminary report Friday that listed a gunshot wound to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The department expressed its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police's Fugitive Search Unit, the Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department, and local residents for their assistance in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
LSU athletic sports director Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement for "timely justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6-inch tall player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 ricochets per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "shut down" and "in shock" after Wade's death.
Wade has said that "it's something that worries a person all the time."
Volcano Spreads Ashes Over Mexico City
The ash ejected from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexican citizens Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater rose and 183 gas and ash discharges were recorded in the past 24 hours.
The center observed numerous tremors and tremors.
Photos posted on social media showed a thin layer of dust covering the windshields of cars in some of Mexico City's neighborhoods, for example in Hokimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, which is also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the gendarmerie as thousands joined opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing secession vote.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed in by the gendarmerie, began throwing eggs and powder paint at the peacekeepers, creating dark and dusty clouds in the streets, which are usually swarming with tourists.
Later in the day, there were other skirmishes with the police, with the police resorting to their batons to control the situation.
For hours, pro-independence groups shouted "We don't forget, we don't forgive", while those who declared themselves to preserve the country's integrity responded with "Spain Forever".
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical attention for minor injuries.
Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region even a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vast majority voted for independence, although turnout was low as most opponents of secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in voting stations in the region with a number of violent clashes.
Independence-seeking groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer harbors hope for Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be at a standstill," the man added.
Despite a marked important victory, be it by a narrow margin, in the last December regional elections, Catalonia's pro-independence political parties are struggling this year, as many of their most prominent leaders are either in self-imposed exile or have been arrested pending trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, claims that the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
His comment was that "it's getting more and more intense".
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine arrested Catalan leaders awaiting a preliminary trial from last year, announced he would run in next year's European Parliament election.
He argues that "my candidacy for the European elections is the best way to oppose the regression of democratic values and the repression we are seeing from the Spanish government".
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashes into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39 respectively, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard Crescent Thursday around 7:30 UK time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings has announced that damage has been done to both the gate and the building itself.
It is also possible that a crossbow was fired at the car.
Menga's goal brings Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Premier League newcomer Livingston surprised Rangers and dealt only a second loss to Steven Gerrard in his first 18 games as the club's manager from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal proved crucial, and Gary Holt's team tied for second in the Hibernian standings.
Gerard's team went without a win away in the Premier League this season, and next Sunday faced leader Harts, from which it was eight points behind in the standings.
But before that Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, is already in a six-game streak without a loss in the championship, and manager Holt has not yet tasted the loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed good opportunities against idle guests
Holt's team had to lead in the score long before scoring, and his direct style of play extremely hampered Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his shot went sideways, then Alan Lithgow fired past the beam after Craig Halketh returned the ball head-on to him.
The hosts left Rangers to play the ball, knowing that they could seriously hamper guests from static situations.
And it was in this way that the winning goal was reached.
The Rangers committed a foul, and Livingston played well, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining each other and leading Menga, who led the ball and scored from the middle of the penalty area.
Until now Rangers held the ball more, but faced the home's impenetrable defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to interfere.
This style of play continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a save.
Rangers goalkeeper saved Scott Pittman's foot kick, and a Litlow head shot passed the door after another static position for Livingston.
In the penalty area of Livingston rained centereds, which, however, were easily cleared, and the judge twice did not respect the claims of the guests for a penalty - first after a single fight between Halket and Glen Middleton Reserve, and then in case of doubts about hand play.
"Phenomental" by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great score for Livingston.
The team played simply superbly, continuing to exceed expectations and improve their performance.
The style of the game and the composition hardly underwent changes after the team's return to the Premier League, but Holt deserves much praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the field.
Captain Halket was amazing, organizing the defense in a superb way, while Menga constantly kept Conor Goldson and Joe Worrell under pressure.
At the same time, the Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, they demonstrated some great things, but in this case they were way below those standards.
They missed the last pass before the goal, having only once managed to split the defense of the home team - this loss should awaken Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), we witnessed smiles and blue expanses when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to repair relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship has cooled due to problems affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey's admission to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, police prevented a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, yet there were many supporters around who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to allow him into the country.
The various protests reflected the fault caused by one visitor, who was perceived as a hero by some German Turks and, at the same time, despised as a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies after collision with car
A cyclist has died after a collision with a car in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, around 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and medical assistance arrived, but the cyclist nevertheless died on the spot.
The crash occurred a few months after another cyclist died after being hit by a runaway driver on Childers Street, nearly a mile from the scene of Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police announced that its officers were working to identify the man, after which they would notify his relatives.
The road is closed and bus lines are diverted, and motorcyclists are also advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in mutiny
Six prison guards were injured in a riot in the men's high-security prison, the Prison Service reported.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcester at nearly 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and is still ongoing.
In order to contain it, special personnel from the Tordano unit were called in, who would have to deal with eight inmates, with the mutiny itself confined to one wing of the prison.
The injured guards suffered minor injuries to the persons and received medical attention on the spot.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service issued the following statement: "Specially trained officers have been called in to deal with the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons and we make it extremely clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police, and their sentences may be extended".
There are more than 500 inmates in Long Lartin prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after an attack on a prisoner, the director of the prison had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, riot police officers were called to the prison to contain a heavy mutiny in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash flooding Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although drought-prone areas may benefit)
It is rare for Arizona to be hit by a tropical storm, but there is a good chance that this will happen early next week as weakening Hurricane Rosa drifts across the desert to the southwest, bringing with it the risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already set up flash flood shelters on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Finisc on Tuesday, and may bring rain in late Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that "since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have sustained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
Recent models from the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches at Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern wilderness, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of rain possible in individual locations.
For those who are not threatened by flash floods, Rosa's rain may actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, some rain is likely to be useful as the southwest is currently in drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Commission, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least excessive drought, which is the second-most severe category," weather.com reported.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to landfall at the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who on Sunday morning can still boast a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encountered cooler waters over the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakened.
It is therefore expected to reach land at Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain over part of Mexico can be severe and lead to a significant risk of overdwelling.
"Summary rains of up to 6 inches from Baja California to northwestern Sonora are expected, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa would then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which would then pass through Arizona in southern Utah through Tuesday late night.
"The main risk of Rosa or her consequences is extremely heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center warned.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flash floods and waste-bearing streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous terrains.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old child was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsamer Norton around 04:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
He was placed in a hospital where his condition remained "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock district, police in Avon and Somerset said.
Police are asking anyone who may have filmed what happened to contact them.
Trump says Cavanaugh "suffered by the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party
"Every vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote that rejects the insidious and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Cavanaugh had "suffered from the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Cavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of decades-old sexual assault at the time the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the prosecution hearing.
The President issued a statement on Saturday that "today the American people have witnessed Cavanaugh's intelligence, courage and qualities."
"Every vote in favor of Judge Cavanaugh is a vote in favor of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a fine reputation in the service of the public," the president told a crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Cavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes for the general election.
"There are five weeks to go until some of the most important elections of our time.
Although I am not a candidate, in reality I am also involved," Trump continued.
"That's why I go around and fight in support of good applications."
Trump noted that Democrats have made it a mission to "obstruct and obstruct."
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for Cavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, as reported by one of the senior Republican Party aides to CNN.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, death toll rises
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were swept off the coast by giant waves when a strong earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when at nightfall the coast was swept away by waves up to six metres (18 ft) high, carried many to their deaths and destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami struck after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, which is why many fell victim to the disaster," the spokesman for Indonesia's Disaster Relief Agency, BNPB, said during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The water had taken with it cars, trees, whole houses, struck everything in its path," Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
"Some people climbed the trees and thus managed to save themselves from the water," he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, collapsed and twisted bridges, as well as a water-covered mosque.
The aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) issued a statement saying that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographic location of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and specified that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of collapsed buildings, the spokesman added, then added that 540 people had been injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be higher along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is located closer to the quake's epicenter.
He also added that "communications have been completely cut off and there is no information from Donggala."
The Red Cross, for its part, indicated that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers are already heading to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get even worse."
On Saturday, the agency was vehemently criticized for failing to inform about the Palu tsunami, although officials explained that the waves arrived at the time of the announcement.
Amateur videos shared on social media showed a man upstairs yelling at people on the street for panic warnings about the approaching tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall slams into the shore and takes away both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to authenticate the clip in due course.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a severe power outage that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still desperately need food and other essentials.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
The death toll in the Indonesian tsunami is now over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala were able to get safely to Palu, where they took refuge in tarpaulin shelters stretched out in their office yard, they walked past a number of scenes of devastation, Mr. Dosebba says.
"They told me they saw countless destroyed houses".
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite having started work on rescue and recovery operations, some complain that foreign rescuers with extensive experience in similar situations are being prevented from reaching Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, sending personnel and supplies from abroad can only be started if the stricken place is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The disaster is still at the regional level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government has announced that it is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but from there they have not yet declared such a status".
As the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami falls on Palu, the friends and families of those still missing continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones have somehow survived the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the ruins for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandonno, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roa-Roa hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi added.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel had reached the paragliding community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to the contestants in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue bookmarks, however, the only response to his messages was a single gray one.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he added.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a loading at an ATM in Newport on Levy
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who charged an ATM in Levi's Newport, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM at the amusement complex and was preparing to load it with cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the announcement.
While the man was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink employee" and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, the statement continued, but police did not indicate the number involved in the theft.
Anyone with information on the identity of the suspects should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Yee
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote, "The man officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as a title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change preceded his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he was expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, who gave up "due to emotional reasons," the show's creator tells us.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously argued that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you' or 'you,'" West shared earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"This way I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means only one person, just Yeh - which is a reflection of the good in us, of the evil, of the confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
The rapper is one of many known in his field who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has had a number of nicknames and nicknames, including Puff Daddy, P Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the aliases Lion and Brother Lion.
One of West's previous collaborators, Jay Z, also performed in a variant with or without a hyphen and/or capital letters in his nickname.
Mexico's president vows not to use army against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force as the country nears the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, President Lopez Obrador vowed "never to use the army to oppress the Mexican people.""
Soldiers fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people as left-wing student movements gradually spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador took an oath to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening more free public universities.
The President also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attracts youth to criminal gangs.
US must double funding for AI development
At a time when China is becoming increasingly active on the AI development front, the U.S. needs to double its budget for AI research, according to AI researcher and developer Kai-Fu Loi, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various units of the U.S. government made statements on the subject of AI, although the U.S. generally has no formal AI strategy.
During this time, China presented its plan as early as last year: the country aims to become number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI development budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the United States and are yet to make further breakthroughs on AI," Lee said.
Double funding could also double the chances that the next big AI achievement will come from the US, as Lee informed CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book "AI's Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, Lee worked on an AI system that beat the most successful oto player in America, then was CEO at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee paid tribute to previous technology competitions of the federal government, for example the robotics competition of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when it would be the next one to help recognize the new visionaries.
"Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government funding," Lee said.
"It's not China that takes away academic executives, it's corporations," the man claimed.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired university luminaries to work on AI.
Lee also argues that changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. boost its AI program.
"I believe that AI science doctors should be automatically offered green cards," the man claims.
The U.S. State Council unveiled its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other state organizations fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to include partners from the industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA reported a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they are currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI development from there.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to set up a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence, has not noted any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change their country's name
Macedonia's citizens voted in a referendum this Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia". It is a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocks Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where an area named Macedonia exists, claims that its northern neighbour's name represents claims against its territorial integrity, therefore vetoing its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he himself would not vote in the referendum, while at the same time a campaign to boycott him casts doubt on whether the referendum will manage to reach the minimum 50 percent required to recognise its validity.
The question on the ballots reads as follows: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the cost is worth paying to achieve the entry of the post-Yugoslavia-formed state of Macedonia into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to give my vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough members of parliament have ruled that they will comply with the result to such an extent that the vote already has a decisive weight.
In order to change the name of the state, two-thirds of the parliamentary representatives must vote for this.
The State Election Commission reported that there had been no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last 2016 parliamentary election, when 66 percent of registered voters attended the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in the referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will open the way for joining NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and arranging chairs in front of the tents stretched by the boycotting referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads proudly raised, not through the wicket for servants," said Kavadarkov.
"Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union".
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will lead to the investment needed for Macedonia, as the unemployment rate in the state is over 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as over 80 percent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after releasing his own vote.
The statesman also said that the positive result would lead to "affirmation of the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies published results of a poll that estimated between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - which is below the required turnout.
Another poll, by Macedonian television Thelma, announced that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will represent the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it won power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero goes through all of Brighton's defense and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's play for his goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine top scorer was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He outran three Brighton defenders before sprinting with the ball into the empty space ahead.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He snuck past one of the defenders, then left the rest behind on the border of Brighton's penalty area.
He then passed to the left to Sterling.
The English striker with one touch brought the ball back to Aguero, who with a right-footed kick overcame Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his neck.
"Aguero is struggling with some injuries in his legs," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We planned for him to play about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at this very moment".
But it was Sterling who secured the initial advance of the "skys blues" in this Premier League match of England.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In the scoring situation Aguero got a pitch deep into Brighton's half.
He immediately dropped an exit pass on the left flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sanne advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a pass on the far beam.
The striker of the "sky blues" managed to detect closely, shortly before the ball went out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match at 12:55 on Tuesday afternoon at the Rain Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play down the fate of Rockies
Since the Nationals didn't qualify for the playoffs, there's little point in another game of starting starter pitcher.
Still, the always-ambitious Scherzer hopes to be a Sunday starter against Colorado Rockies if the match is relevant to the Rockies, who lead one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West standings.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card match after a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is still uncertain that they will win their first division title.
"Although we don't fight for anything ourselves, we want to end the season with a good game in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win perhaps the most important game of the year for them.
Why would I want to miss such a match?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but are supposed to allow Scherzer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34th game as a starting pitcher this year, with him holding practice on Thursday and having the normal break time until Sunday.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has an 18-7 balance with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump Gains Support in West Virginia
The president gave a blunt hint about the situation with his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Cavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes in the general election.
"In November everything we have achieved will be at risk.
There are five weeks left until some of the most important choices of our lives.
It's one of the biggest moments in the current history - and I also say that while I'm not a candidate, I'm actually involved as well, that's why I'm fighting with all my might for the right candidates," Trump said.
He went on to say, "You all see this scary, terrifying radical group of Democrats, you see them with your own eyes.
They are determined to regain power in any way, you yourselves are witnesses to their ruthlessness, to malice.
They don't care when they can get hurt, who they have to run over in order to cling to power and government, because they are only interested in power and government, but we will not give them to them".
Democrats, in the president's words, have set themselves the goal of "obstructing and obstructing."
"Which we've all seen in the last four days," he continued, calling the Democrats "angry, nasty, mean and unfaithful."
The president reminded the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which caused loud booing from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you distribute the document?
Excuse me, what?
No, no, I've been waiting - that was really bad sign language - maybe the worst I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer open-minded.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak out
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I am just the last Labour Member of Parliament so far to be told that he is not welcome - just because I speak frankly.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment as she resolutely confronted anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship has criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy disagreed at the time of the previous leaders.
The notice of the Nottingham East Labour Assembly on Friday said that "we wish the assemblies to include all and be fruitful".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in Parliament, Friday's meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and promises of a "lighter and more measured" policy have long been forgotten, if ever.
It was becoming increasingly apparent that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion was judged on the basis of how much the party leadership liked it.
This began soon after Jeremy became the leader, while colleagues I worked for previously thought shared similar political views, began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions I would never agree with - be it on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I make public statements - no matter what I'm actually saying - there's a whole insulting tirade on social media where it's called for recall, rejection of moderate politics, statements that I don't belong with Labour.
Like this isn't just happening to me.
As a matter of fact, I know that I even got more lucky than some of my colleagues, as the comments about me at least are mostly of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purposefulness of those colleagues who face sexist or racist subterfuge every day without being intimidated by them.
One of the greatest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults became the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is now far from broad-minded, with any sign of distrust or change in the rules of choice becoming more narrow-minded.
Over the past two years, I have received numerous advices to keep quiet, not to talk so much, and that then "everything will be fine".
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student provoked by Thatcher's government, which through its neglect led to the literal disintegration of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most - either as a local councilor or as a minister.
I have never concealed my political views, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political stance and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported Friday's proposal, I would like to say that when the state moves towards Brexit, it will hurt households, firms and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the Labour leader.
But in reality, my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of recall or political excommunication will deter me from acting in the way I consider best in protecting your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Unbeatable Air led the way in the standings
The two late essays may have changed the final score slightly, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Tennent Premier League game.
The team now tops the standings and only of the ten teams is unbeaten so far.
Better defense and better use of opportunities proved crucial in the match, of which coach Peter Murchi and his team can be very pleased.
"I'm happy because the other teams tested us quite seriously in the past games, and we're still unbeaten," Murchi noted.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Congratulations to Air, they really took advantage of their situations better than we did."
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful extra kick by Frazier Climo, brought Air forward in the score, but a yellow card for Scottish national Rory Hughes, released to play in the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to catch up in the score after Jason Bagot realized an essay followed by a failed extra kick.
Climo increased the lead for Eyre from a penalty kick shortly before half-time, scoring an essay after a solo action, and then realizing the extra kick, making the score 17-5 for Eyre on the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful extra kick by Bagot, reduced the lead to just five points.
There was a prolonged suspension of play due to a severe injury to Ruaridt Nott, who was carried out on a stretcher, and after the match was resumed Air increased their advance after an essay by Stafford McDowall and a successful extra kick by Climo.
Air Blair's acting captain McPherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage by exerting strong pressure and realizing an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful extra kick.
However, the hosts regained their presence of spirit and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after knocking down Klimo without a ball, from the subsequent penalty play McPherson realized an essay using Air's advancing offensive line.
Climo realized the extra kick, and not long after he did it again after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kicked ball and led winger Gregor Henry out on the flank for the hosts' fifth essay.
Still Game star appears to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears to be heading for a more direct and warm industry after it was discovered he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor played Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular show, on which he is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last for the show, with Kiernan seemingly already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a source from the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was planning to tap into Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
"The sea is ours": no outlet to the sea Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors are constantly patrolling the rigging naval headquarters in La Paz.
There's an ocean blue flag flying over the public buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are adorned with the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right.
It is our duty to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost outlet handed over to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still alive - as is the call to sail the Pacific again.
In fact, this hope is currently the strongest in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a ruling from the international court on October 1, after five years of consideration have already passed.
"The strength is in Bolivia, there is cheerfulness and unity everywhere, and the country expects a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the international court's ruling on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic local president, who is about to head into a tight re-election battle next year, has also placed a lot and a lot on the court's judgment on Monday.
"We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific," Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the likelihood that the court will make a decision in Bolivia's favor is quite small, and that even if it ruled in its favor, it would not change things into reality.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the authority to take Chile's territory and has ruled that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the international court is only six months after the hearing of the last arguments points out that the case "is not complicated," Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law, retorted.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have actually hurt it.
"The problem of access to the ocean was bloated by the current government of Bolivia," Zarate claimed.
He then hinted that Morales' belligerent rhetoric had also wiped out Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult after what happened to conduct a normal dialogue.
The two countries have not maintained diplomatic missions in each other since 1962.
The previous president, Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
According to him, on Monday Bolivia will have "an incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relationship with Chile" as well as a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement by achieving a benefit for both sides."
Calzadilla also rejected the idea that Morales - who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - had used the problem of ocean access as a "political crutch".
"Bolivia will never give up its right to go out to the Pacific," he added.
"Resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome our past problems."
North Korea says it will not proceed with nuclear disarmament until it can trust the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never proceed with nuclear disarmament first if it is unable to trust Washington.
Ri presented his speech Saturday to the UN General Assembly.
He urged the US to keep the promises it made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared on the verge of relaunching deadlocked diplomacy on the nuclear issue more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korea's Kim Yong Un.
Ri called "empty hope" the idea that continuing with U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration that would end the Korean War would bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture along the path of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal they see as the only way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest scream in massive hats that will soon be in fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block out the sun's rays, you don't need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection that stunned the catwalk during Paris Fashion Week.
The rather impractical hats sparked a wave on Instagram over the summer, with designers sending their eye-catching creations to astound the fashion community.
Valentino's protruding suggestion was an extravagant beige hat with feather-like broad brims that literally swallowed the models' heads.
The other too huge accessories included jewelry-adorned watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple - but they are not meant to keep warm on your head.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had their lips sewn shut and reminded not so much of haute couture as of Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled diving gear complete with snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted cone of ice cream.
If you're into such fashion trends, you're in luck.
Fashion specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold at fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come very soon after "La Bomba" - the straw hat with a two-foot periphery that was seen on everyone's heads - from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski..
The cult of the extremely impractical hat that took over social networks led to the emergence of another huge design on the catwalk - a straw beach bag, almost as big as the wearing one wearing a swimsuit model.
The orange-coloured raffia bag, with raffia fringe and a white leather handle, was the eye-catching item in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitid told FEMAIL, "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer - after the designer has made such an impression, it will be hard to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with another superb exam performance that is only enhanced by individual and collective success in sports disciplines, art, music and other social sciences.
With up to 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their place in a global world.
As an education sector that can compile and implement a personal curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language they can understand, your words get to them.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year's exams, we see that languages come first with the highest scores for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved the A grade.
Data collected from 74 members of SCIS schools showed that 72% of students achieved an A score in Chinese, with the same score having 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those with Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland perceive foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Currently, languages as a subject of free choice by students receive the same treatment as natural-mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in the programs of independent schools and beyond.
A 2014 survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission showed that 17% of the reasons employers have difficulty finding employees indicated insufficient language competences.
Because of this, more and more foreign language proficiency is becoming mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require proficiency in a foreign language, making these skills essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person masters a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, having mastered a similar skill that remains for life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the multi-lingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adult UK citizens in 2013, 75% were not fluent in a foreign language well enough to be able to conduct a language, with French being the only language whose proficiency reached a double-digit percentage with an indicator of 15%.
That is why investing in language learning today is important for children now.
Fluency in several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in terms of languages taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered more important to the UK in a future plan by 2020, for example Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, with educators being specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed in life, regardless of what the future holds.
At the moment, there is no denying that in a global business environment, languages continue to have an incredibly important role for the future of any country, which requires this to be taken into account in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should actually be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his Lakers debut this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are eager to see LeBron James' first game with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will take part in the team's first game of pre-season training against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it is not yet specified how many minutes he will play in the fight.
"It will be on the field between one and 48 minutes," Walton announced jokingly via the Lakers' official website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudel announced in a Tweeter that James was likely to play relatively few minutes in the match.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans regarding the six games of the Lakers' preseason.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five planned Trump rallies that included stops at familiar locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By delaying the confirmatory vote on his choice to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming midterm election, as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time will the Trump rally take place in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m., Eastern Time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia, below via the live YouTube broadcast.
Trump is likely to consider this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, in which tensions have emerged over allegations of immoral sexual acts, holding the Senate confirmation vote for up to a week while an FBI investigation is under way.
However, the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November election.
Therefore, in President Donald Trump's campaign, it was announced that these five rallies next week were aimed at "activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to defend and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so essential to his program that the president will visit as many states as possible and we are starting a campaign season full of commitments," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who declined to be named.
Tonight's rally, planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters and attract media attention from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrissey, who has fallen behind in opinion polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to give him a boost in polls," said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
"Ryder Cup" 2018: US team will fight to the last, keeping their hopes alive before singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without the intrigue "fursome" the Sunday afternoon matches may have brought what the Ryder Cup needed.
Changing the advantage in sports is a rather subjective concept, in which, however, players believe unreservedly, especially in competitions like this.
So which team is in a better position right now?
"They were leading by six points, and now it's only four, so I guess we've got some momentum," Jordan Spieth said at the end of today's race day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage with only twelve more to allocate.
As Spit says, however, Americans have more to show and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge by the sports form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Spit shows excellent form from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of his team.
The cheers of the fans grew louder as he progressed into the round in which, with a precise stroke, he tied the score in the fourth game after he and Thomas trailed by two strokes after the first two holes.
His shot, which won them the game on the 15th hole, was met with strong ecstatic reactions that lead us to believe that indeed not all is lost for the American team.
"The important thing is not to think about anything else and focus on your own game," says Speight.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed heroes of the Ryder Cup so far.
The strange but delightful couple from Europe won four out of four and it seems to be working out for them.
The Mollywoods were the only couple who didn't make bogies on Sunday afternoons, but they also didn't have bogies on Saturday mornings or Friday afternoons or mornings.
These consistent successes, as well as the way energy seemed to pass between them and enthusiastic fans, solidified the view that they are the players who will win on Sunday and there will be no better pair than Fleetwood and Molinari that will bring Europe's potential victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
The tales of European fame, however, turned out to be a bit premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's "furball" matches, while he partnered with Alex Noren.
"Bogi" and two "doubles" of the first nine holes got the Spaniard and Swede into problems that they failed to deal with.
In Sunday games, however, there is no one else to solve your problems.
"Fourball" and "fursom" matches are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they exchange with each other, and the way a strategy can undergo changes at any moment.
The Europeans played better team and therefore gained a significant lead before the last day, but this session of "fursom" matches showed that the American team was also ready to fight to the last - something that many people, especially in the United States, strongly doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup, having led the United States 10-6 after playing the matches of the "furball" and "fursom" formats on Saturday.
Inspiring duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari started with two wins against inconclusive Tiger Woods, bringing their assets at the Le Golf National race to four points.
In an attempt to regain the trophy that he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated the morning "furball" matches over the Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and Europe eventually won the series with 3-1 wins.
The United States put up more resistance in the "fursom" matches, where they won two wins, but failed to narrow the gap.
Jim Furik's team needs 8 points from the 12 singles matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first rookie from Europe to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known as "Moliwood", after this sensational weekend became only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After they unapologetically outplayed Woods and Patrick Reid in the "furball" matches, they were extremely motivated to defeat the battered Woods and American rookie Bryson Decambu with an even more definitive 5&4 score.
Woods, who barely made it through his two games on Saturday, only occasionally demonstrated bursts of genius, but so far has 19 losses from 29 games in "furball" and "fursom" matches, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who got a break for the morning's "furball" matches, partnered with Henrik Stenson in the "fursom" clashes in the 2&1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopka - number one and number three in the world, respectively.
However, the team of Europe failed to enjoy a completely pleasant, cool and cloudless day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas returned the hopes of the Americans by winning two points on Saturday.
They achieved a difficult 2-1 win against Spaniard John Ramm and Jan Polter in the "furball" matches, and later returned to defeat Polter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the "fursom" matches, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team caught up with a four-point deficit before the singles, and according to the regulation, Furik's team will hold the trophy even in a tie.
However, after being outplayed in two consecutive days, it seems their chances of a turnaround on Sunday are not particularly great.
North Korea says 'no way' to disarm unilaterally, without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepened distrust of the United States, and there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the world organization, Ri Yong-hou said that "significant measures of good will" have been taken in the past year, for example, we are suspending nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test site, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security, and under no circumstances will we be the first to disarm unilaterally."
While Ri was expressing North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking stepwise measures, his statement seemed significant as he did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement from Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work for "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump gave guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea was seeking an official end to the Korean War of 1950-1953, but the U.S. said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'eliminating nuclear weapons first' and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal through coercion, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a meaningless dream of those who don't know us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump was planned, which the U.S. leader stressed through the U.N. earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister focused on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the country on the issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a standstill.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean missiles at the US mainland was inevitable after "evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with "total destruction", praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there was no deadline for this and said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must necessarily continue until full, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament takes place."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but after only a few hours North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wished to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students on a course for enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all students sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of "all-night" learning with the help of caffeine.
A lecturer found that students at the world's number one university often don't even think twice when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Keisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, has drafted the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"Finally, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why are they only telling me this now, in my senior year?'
She said no one ever spoke to her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after students were found to be suffering from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive assignments.
In one part, there is an image of a dorm room where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers, and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of bedtime routines.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke," added Prof. Keisler.
The culture of pride of "all-night learning" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students mean sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring sufficient and quality sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" in combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says - even in order to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, causing them to be constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaysler in preparing the course by taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says the course "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is for all graduates to be asked to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kaysler recommends that students consider setting a bedtime and wake alarm and knowing the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can upset the circadian rhythm and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal crushed Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's jester defeated Steven Gerrard's idealess team and brought a 1-0 win for Livingston.
The Aybrox team wanted to record their first away win since the February 4-1 triumph over St Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only dealt Gerard's second defeat in his 18 games as manager, which left his team eight points short of Harts' breakaway team, a leader in the Ladbrokes Premier League.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and Rangers' idealess team at no point seemed close to leveling off.
After the game Rangers fell to sixth place, and Livingston are now third, trailing the second Hibernian only on goal difference.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems as side judge Callum Spence suffered a head wound after being hit with an object that was apparently thrown by the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that defeated Eyre in the semi-finals of the League of Scotland Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came up with the same eleventh of Livingston, who pulled a point against Harts last week, and should have been pleased with the way his aggressive team pared all of the opponent's actions.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston did better on the rarer occasions when they owned it.
They were supposed to score in the second minute when Menga one-touched Scott Pittman against goalkeeper Alan McGregor, but the midfielder missed the good opportunity.
Later centering on Keegan Jacobs by foul found captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow deflected the ball away from the back beam.
The Rangers took control of the game, but were unable to create anything meaningful in the final third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought he should have a penalty in the 15th minute when he clashed with Stephen Lawless, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers made only two accurate shots in the first half, but former Aybrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily coped with Lasana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Edzaria's weak shot.
Although Livy's hit in the 34th minute was surprising in view of possession of the ball, it was fully deserved.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' deep centering.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher directed the ball to Scott Robinson, who coldly handed Menga, for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacted to the break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this shift almost immediately resulted when the winger passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the blow.
However, Livingston continued to force guests to play in a host-friendly style of play, with Lithgow and Halkett continually pulling off the forward long balls.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final minutes, but McGregor was able to cope with Jacobs's punch, and in the corner following Lithgow fired his head past the beam.
The backup Glenn Middleton of Rangers asked for a penalty at the end of the fight after a one-game fight with Jacobs, but Thomson again saw nothing wrong with the situation.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
Page from our yearbook Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROENE... the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as a Geiger counter.
A cornerstone of science since then, the Geiger counter also became a cornerstone of pop culture when the 1950 film Coronado's Bells was released, which featured the seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: "What in God's name is this
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, e.g. uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released in the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Surely it matters right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to "see" foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to "see" foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory
They can then "see" a protein common to many types of cancer and are injected back into the patient
The trial vaccine showed promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then re-inject into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells was used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat saying "Let's make America great again", while participating in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after making a pointless performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat reading "Let's Make America Great Again", he spoke out against the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people a lot and they ask me, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on complaints of sexual assault made by Christine Blazey Ford.
Although it was not aired, West's recording of the performance was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear why Rock tried to make fun of West with his post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told, "Don't go out with that hat."
I've been harassed!
And then they claim I'm on a sinking ship," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the sinking ship?", claiming that he will put on his Superman costume because it means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love."
The comments caused at least two booings from the audience and the members of the SNL team looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one telling: "The whole studio fell silent."
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West puzzled many with a performance of the song "I Love it", dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT THROUGH THE TASTE."
Talk show host Karen Hunter, however, wrote on Twitter that West was just "being himself and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward a person (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his 'art') for whom I think he welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and now "is officially known as Kenny West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, and followed the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lyon, and music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol.
Charge of attempted murder after stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the prosecution.
"Game of Thrones" star Kit Harrington is against toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role as sword-wielding Jon Snow in the violent medieval HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, who is 31, has spoken out against the stereotype of the macho character, saying that showing such roles on screen leads to young people often thinking that they have to be "raw" in order to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his "Game of Thrones" partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt "firmly convinced" that this problem should be solved.
"At the moment, I am personally firmly convinced - what did we do wrong in terms of masculinity?" he said.
"What are we teaching adolescent men about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the many masculine characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is being taught by television and on the street that makes boys feel they need to become this particular type of man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
Because obviously something is wrong for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be participating in any backstory or sequels to Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer, claiming that he is "done with battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's reenactment of True West, a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened on Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so that way he gave me my future family and defined my life going forward," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the girl Kit's character Jon Snow fell in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The two were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health services, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The majority of new cases are caused by sexual contacts, which marks a change compared to the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, China's health services said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in KGBT communities is widespread.
According to surveys, due to conservative values, 70-90% of men who have had sexual encounters with men end up marrying women.
Many cases of disease transmission are due to improper protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the government of China pledged to provide universal access to HIV medication as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies there is a data leak of Republican senators, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters condemned accusations that a member of her team posted personal information of three Republican state senators on the pages of lawmakers on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were made by experts and sites of the "ultra right wing".
"Lies, lies and more hideous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina state senators Lindsey Graham and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, released by an unknown person from the Capitol during a Senate panel hearing regarding allegations of immoral sexual conduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh.
The leak occurred after the three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office, and released information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my team - whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"There is anger in this denial," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament appropriate for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
I must not question the accuser's motives.
He needs to be calm and balanced."
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of also looking angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"Essentially, if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had approached appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
"Johnny English explodes again" review - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for references to Brexit in any new British-starring film, and it seems that this also applies to the revival of the action-comedy, spy franchise for Johnny English - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will the self-loathing and mimicry that speaks to how obvious it is that we are stupid become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his eyes wide-eyed and "rubbery" face is allowed to renew things for a second time - his name is of the greatest importance when it comes to a large comic creation intended for non-English speaking moviegoers.
He is, of course, a silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of flattering glamour, possesses little of Clouseau, little of Mr Bean, and much of the man who contributed one note to the musical theme Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
In addition, it was initially based on the chaotic traveler and international man Atkinson played in Barclaycard's now-forgotten television commercials.
In the last film with Johnny English, there are either two good moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing medieval armor and briefly the fins clattered in his helmet.
Atkinson's contributions to physical comedy and conspicuous, but the humor is rather faint and strangely redundant, especially when "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible include a dose of comedy.
Humor seems to be directed at children rather than adults, and Johnny English's wacky mishaps are, in my opinion, not innovative and focused, as no Actinson game reminds Mr Bean.
The always current premise is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker has hacked into Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identities of all the operatives to the horror of the on-duty agent - unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for the prime minister, who is a pompous and pompous figure and is already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this quasi-Theresa-May role, but there is nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that she needs to summon some retired agent, as all active agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is currently working as a teacher at a chic center, who, however, illegally teaches lessons on how to be an undercover agent: there are some good hits here when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English was called to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-time sidekick Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a family man married to a submarine commander, a merry role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve Her Majesty's big secret service problems and face the fatally beautiful Ophelia Bouletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister comes under the dangerous influence of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their odyssey of farces: disguised as waiters, set a French restaurant on fire; create chaos when they sneak onto Volta's luxury yacht; and English causes real anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to get to know the interior of Volta's house.
All the jokes are certainly taken from the previous film, but since so sympathetic and lush, there is quite a bit more content here intended for children.
Pretty mediocre production.
Just as with other Johnny English films, I keep thinking: can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that suits his talent?
Labour denies it is developing a plan for Britons to work four days a week but get paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan under which the British would work four a week but get paid for five.
The party claims it wants company bosses to provide the savings made through revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them another day off.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but receive the same pay.
Sources say the idea would "fit" the party's economic agenda and plans to shake the country in favor of workers.
The switch to a four-day work week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be reported before the end of the year.
"It will not happen right away, but the four-day work week is an aspiration that fits into the approach of rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Green Party promised a four-day work week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, at the moment, this aspiration does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not in the party's politics being considered by it."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to unveil his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from "faceless directors" and "speculators" in utility firms.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current owners of shares in water companies may not get their full share, as the Labour government could impose "deductions" based on the violations found.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and set up privatization funds to transfer 10 percent of the net capital of private firms to employees who can accumulate annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John F. Kennedy talk to "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the bureau's findings could have caused some of the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after this statement came out, and asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, firm and unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh, and to change that, it takes a shattering accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it outright," Graham added, addressing Christine Blasius Ford.
"And no one whom she mentioned, but could confirm it.
This is from 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it help reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive lineup of performers and performs an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people on the great Central Park lawn who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but will also get to know the true purpose of the event - eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a number of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise connecting in order to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen 12 years before it achieved its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an ingenious way to convince them to demand action or is it just another case of so-called "clectiveism" - people think they're doing something significant when they sign an online petition or send a Twitter post?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who insist on a multitude of different goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies amounting to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, with at least $10 billion already paid or raised from them.
The group believes that the funds provided have already directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the "Power of Nutrition", a UK-based partnership between investors and contractors, a commitment to "help children develop their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after more than 4,700 Twitter posts from "global citizens" were received.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a mere historical note," said Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ullman to the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government had reported funding for a project, "The Power of Nutrition", that would reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website asking "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
"Global Citizen" replied: This will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fail and still fail.
But just as with the big civil rights movement and anti-apartheid movement before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are just a few of the performers at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use naval forces to "block" and impede energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering markets, including the Middle East, US Home Secretary Ryan Zink has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zink argues that Russia's engagement in Syria - specifically, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just like they did in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block them to make sure that energy products do not get to the market," he said.
Zink addressed attendees at the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
"The economic option with regard to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, fuel stimulation and replacement," he said, while describing Russia as a "single-number pony", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with boosting liquid gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials in the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says is turning Berlin into a "hostage".
Moscow has stressed several times that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is dictated simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industry (DBDI), urged the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look" at 2020 run for president, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "take a serious look" at the run for president after the midterm elections.
During a city council in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed he was considering running.
"It's time for women to come into Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will take the run for president seriously."
Warren expressed his judgment regarding President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I worry to the bottom of my heart as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a poll conducted on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters did not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent for and 48 percent against.
Other senior Democratic officials discussed regarding a potential 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin named Trak Palin's PTSD at rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident Monday night.
"What my own son is going through after coming back is familiar to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are going home with," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an "elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little changed, hardened, come back and wonder if they'll get that respect that they and their brothers-in-arms have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, was included in a report of domestic violence and possession of a DUI, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Vasila's police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang and domestic violence.
On Friday, officials from the 18 states and county filed a goodwill petition in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August, was not disclosed.
She claimed that her partner "and the sons of the cruel members of his gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
The U.S. attorneys who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the U.S., as nations facing pervasive gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 Immigrant Appeals Board decision, which allowed immigrant documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
D.C. attorney Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be processed according to the specific facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates this principle," the Goodwill Report said.
In addition, the lawyers argued in the report that the policy, which refused entry to immigrants, harmed the US economy, arguing that they were more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to suspend granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is given to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a specific social group or political beliefs," Sessions said in his July 11 announcement on politics.
The refuge was never intended to alleviate all the problems - not even all the serious ones - that people face every day, anywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as deaths double during search for survivors
The situation for survivors is getting more severe.
"I feel very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her sick baby boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance carries more corpses.
Pure water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes to try to salvage something from their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the victims, including Dwi Harris, who had suffered a fracture of his spine and shoulder, were housed outside Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outdoors due to ongoing aftershocks.
His eyes fill with tears as he recalls how he felt the violent earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was cornered in the ruined wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he had come to town with the family to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she fell silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official newspaper in China ran a four-page ad in a US daily about the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid publication in Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections.
Trump's accusation that Pecky was trying to interfere with the U.S. congressional election noted what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to run commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an escalating trade war, in which they are leveling import tariffs between countries.
According to experts from the United States and China, at the beginning of the trade war, customs tariffs in China were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing was harming American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a commentary in the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, "currently doubles this harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the government of China has taken advantage of America's respected tradition of freedom of speech and press by running a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited speeches and you will not see real coverage of the divergent opinions that the Chinese people may have regarding China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media are under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most famous newspapers avoided offering to publish" his article, although he did not specify which one.
With Kavanaugh's pogrom, Republicans push back female voters for midterm elections, analysts warn
As many of the top Republicans stand by and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over several sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that there will be a backlash, specifically from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around this are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already noted that they wish to continue with a vote.
These things can't be turned back," said Grant Raher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Raher said he doubted whether last-minute insistence by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) on an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow or in November," Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate hallway as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasius Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded," Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news.
"People say the problem is already serious; it's true.
But it can get even more serious, especially among female suburban voters and younger voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don't vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed for confirmation of the candidacy.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican Party's National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench. It's about how Republicans handle this and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem somewhat divided on the question of who to trust as a consequence of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more leaning towards the second.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate showed her genitals to her while they were at a party during her Yale studies in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new internet to attack Google and Facebook
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee is launching a venture that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the Berners-Lee Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said regarding the venture.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "online personal data repository" or POD.
It contains lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional instruments.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through any browser, and at the same time it is all of them at the same time.
What is unique about the online repository of personal data is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it "giving authority to personal data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to put resources, processes and appropriate skills into helping Solid become accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developers contracted to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change when all of their business models were completely updated overnight.
"We don't ask permission from them."
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide energy for commerce and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a strong influence in the net neutrality debate.
Despite launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: in memory of the priest awarded the Victoria Cross in World War I
It commemorates 100 years in the hometown of the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross for his participation in combat in World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel the Reverend Bernard Van won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellengliese and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, unaware that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honours.
A memorial was unveiled Saturday by his two grandchildren, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "extremely symbolic" for the monument to be unveiled exactly 100 years since his grandfather's medal-winning case.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in very thick fog and under heavy fire from artillery and machine guns."
He later attacked the line of fire and with "incredible bravery" led the line forward before attacking an artillery gun with one hand and killing three of the unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do, but it makes me humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Van placed a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was "a great honor for him to take part in the parade" and added "the valor of a true hero is demonstrated through the support that will be provided to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Peppa Pig
Imagine waiting all night to watch a full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you can't witness the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six from the main card and was scheduled to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK remained stunned when the show changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after staying up until the early hours, especially because of the fight.
A fan on Twitter described switching the children's cartoon as "some sick joke".
"The government regulated that at 6 a.m. this content was not appropriate, so the program was switched to a children's broadcast," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, in response to a question about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Bellator company president Scott Cocker said they would work on scheduling the meetings to include UK viewers in the future.
"In my opinion, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Cocker said.
"It's six in the morning on Sunday, however, and there is no way to plan things so that here the event will be held on Sunday, and there - on Monday.
We're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was government.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will stick to including five fights instead of six - as we usually do. We tried to provide more to the fans, but we overdid it.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt "inferior" due to his sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daly says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else due to his sexuality - but that has motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claimed that until he started studying in middle school, he didn't realize that "not everyone is like me."
In an interview with the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he became less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The permanent host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, was on sick leave for several months.
Upon participating in Laverne's first program, Daly said he felt "less" than everyone else while growing up, as "it wasn't socially acceptable to like both girls and boys."
He said, "Until today, feeling inferior and being different from others are actually the things that give me the energy and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove he was a "thing," he said, so that he wouldn't let anyone down when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to make a call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he does this because he is happy that he can live openly, without consequences, and wishes to instill "hope" in others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man - American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - had "surprised him."
Daly married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but claims the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much while you're so young," he first participated in the Olympic Games at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said, "it's hard to find someone your age who has experienced similar ups and downs."
The two became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daly, and Daly himself says his "whole world view" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you I was only interested in winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said his father couldn't accept he was going to die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't be there for me, Dad, or in the front row,'" he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and at that moment, when I knew he was dead, I finally admitted he wasn't invulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that all my life I've dreamed of this - jumping in the Olympic Games in front of the audience at home.
It also inspired the selection of his first song, "Proud" by Heather Small, which accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympic Games and still makes him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British summer time.
Lost form Mikkelson remains on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to regain his old form if he does not want his record to be associated with failure.
Mikkelson, who participated in the two-year event for the record 12th time, was left on the bench by captain Jim Furrick for Saturday's "furball" and "fursom" matches.
Rather than being a major figure in the U.S. team again, the five-time winner of major tournaments spent his day as a fan and in training his shots from a distance in hopes of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who even at the peak of his career was never among the straightest players, is not in optimal shape for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where the long uneven terrain usually punishes any wrong hit.
And if the field itself is not disturbing enough, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson will face the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and are looking to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind before the 12 singles matches, make a strong start, it may be that Mikkelson's match is absolutely crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate, though he could hardly have said anything very different.
"He fully understood his role today, patted my back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He's confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given so much both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing in just two games.
I expected him to play more, but it just worked out and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could end his career at the Ryder Cup, which has never come close to his impressive individual achievements.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equal matches, but Furik said his presence brings other benefits to the team that are not measured in figures.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for any team," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun with him too, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the big lead could soon be melted
Europe's team captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the big lead gained before the singles matches of the last day of the Ryder Cup can be easily wiped out.
The Dane debuted in the 1997 Valderrama game, when the team with captain Seve Ballysteros led by five points ahead of the Americans, but right in the final straight was almost caught up and barely managed to hold the 141-2-131-2 victory.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we also had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama we won, but very hard," Bjorn said after the 2018 Europe team won by five to three sessions on Friday and yesterday, leading 10 to six at Le Golf National.
So history has to show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
Be ready to attack tomorrow.
Go out and do what you have to do.
Nothing is over until you see the final score on the scoreboard.
We have a goal and that is to try to win this trophy and that is what we need to stay focused on.
I've said all along that I only think about the 12 players on our team, but we're also aware of our rivals, who are some of the greatest players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of the players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never rush the festivities.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow the individual performances will come to the fore and this is different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything's going well, but when you go out on your own, then you test your entire capacity as a golfer.
This is the message that must reach the players: tomorrow you must give your best.
Now you can turn your back on your partner as well, since he has to give himself away to the end."
Unlike Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furrick will ask his players to perform better individually than as partners, with only Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas taking three out of four possible points.
Furik himself was on both sides of these great reverses on the last day - he was part of the Brookline triumph, and then he was on the losing side when the Europeans performed the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw at Brookline, as well as at Medinah.
When the advantage goes from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches are played under enormous pressure.
That's why we formed our squad and distributed our boys the way we want to try and do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of leading our counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ramm, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Polter would meet the other Europeans in the top half of the lineup.
"I chose these players in that order because I think it gives us the best chances of success," Bjorn said of his choice for the singles.
Germany Delays Launch of New Warship Again
The German Navy's newest frigate was scheduled to be commissioned in 2014 to replace outdated Cold War-era warships, but this will not happen until at least next year due to malfunctioning systems and skyrocketing costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class brand of new frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted an army spokesman.
The vessel was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, e.g. reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - the latest frigates must be able to be used for up to two years before returning to the ports of residence.
However, the continuous delays mean that the avant-garde warships - rumored to allow Germany to demonstrate strength overseas - will already be old when they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware defects" that render the warship unusable if sent on a combat mission.
Software flaws are particularly important as Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship was significantly overloaded, which reduced its efficiency and limited the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is estimated to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is estimated to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - out of the original 2.2 billion euros.
Problems with the latest frigates became particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval forces were shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the fleet was in fact "running out of ships capable of carrying out missions."
The official said the problem had become bigger over time as the old ships were decommissioned, but no new ones were made available.
He complained that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate could join the fleet.
The National Trust monitors the secret lives of bats
A new study carried out at a manor house in the Scottish Highlands aims to establish how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hopes are that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow the common bats as well as the brown arrowheads waterbeds at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations on the estate to track bat activities during the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all the recordings will establish the frequency of the call sounds of the bats, as well as which species make them.
A habitat map and report will then be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to habitat loss.
The risk to populations can be from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In reality, bats are not blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than the eyes when it comes to capturing prey.
They use an advanced echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The Trust has trained experts who conduct regular surveys, shelter inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Threave Manor in the Dumfries and Galloway area, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
Manor manager David Thompson says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave, we have a great pitch for bats," he noted.
"We have old buildings, very old trees and a finished suitable habitat.
But there's a lot more to bats that aren't known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
He stresses that it is important to check for the presence of bats before carrying out property maintenance activities, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of one refuge will kill up to 400 female and young bats, as well as destroy an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "I still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our animal species, as we just don't know what's going on with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations and his lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people "want to become famous" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which publishes these allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of raping American Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly then paid her $375,000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In an Instagram video addressing his 142 million followers, a few hours after the allegations were published, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the post as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is fake news," the five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain popularity on my back, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy person and everything is fine," the footballer smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "inadmissible publication of privacy suspicions," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Scherz said the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount consistent with the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The incident was alleged to have occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the football player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in the Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Majorga claimed that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her he was a "good boy" at "99 percent", but in this case he simply succumbed to "the one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but this happened with her consent.
Majorga also claimed that she went to the police and photographs were taken of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified by revenge" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she is willing to cancel the agreement as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident in question.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer moved to the Italian grand Juventus for the sum of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'will regret forever' losing car manufacturers
Britain "will regret forever" if it loses its status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Secretary for Business Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily suspend production at their plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
The Japanese car maker said the impact of a delay at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant - where the Auris and Avensis models are produced - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union countries.
"My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car makers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have voiced concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will operate.
BMW, for example, say they will close their Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to supply chain risks in cases of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers from both the UK and the EU for custom-built cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be problems at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait more than one day to fill in their inventory at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's "chessy" plan for a future relationship with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border."
"We have to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to seize that opportunity," he said on BBC Radio's 4's Today programme.
"Following claims not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we should be able to continue to provide successful supply chains."
Toyota cannot say how long production will be halted, but in the longer term they warn that additional costs will reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite union at the plant, said that its members are increasingly worried: "From my experience, I judge that if these jobs go, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have set out a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again, White House says
An extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week" as Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh's fight continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump aides and Russia, and the president's potential obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not and thus threaten Mueller's independence has fueled rumors about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting was announced with him for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, as testified by both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday on Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied, "It's not set a date for that yet, it could be this week, but seeing all the other things going on in the Supreme Court, I think it might be postponed until next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host of the show, Chris Wallace, asked about the reason.
Sanders retorted that the rare press conferences were not due to a dislike for the "demonstrative behavior" of television journalists, though he said, "I can't say I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior."
She then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president conducts more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him," she said, adding, without citing evidence, "We checked those statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but "if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that's far better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, and you've witnessed us practice it quite often in recent weeks, and that will replace press conferences once you've had a chance to speak with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Stand-alone press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and at times bizarre behavior in front of the assembled journalists.
Health minister addresses EU workers at Scotland's National Health Service over Brexit fears
The health minister addressed EU staff working at Scotland's National Health Service in writing to express the country's appreciation and willingness to remain in their seats after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months remaining until Britain's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to spending the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also advancing its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm sure this is a very precarious period for all of you.
I would therefore like to recall how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond contribute valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is unconditionally your home and we would very much like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's meeting when his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores by 31-27, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Reid, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
"He went to the sideline and sort of just passed out there," Reid said.
Coaches and medical personnel submitted oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before he was laid on a stretcher and taken to the changing rooms for further examination.
A Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/seriousness of the injury," and that Tennessee State was trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore with a college scholarship, was first season at Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five blocks before leaving the match, making a total of 18 blocks for him this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK
Under new Conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, with the additional funds to help the homeless.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The State Treasury expects an increase of over 120 million pounds per year, which will help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today the decision for foreign buyers to pay a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, with the additional revenue going to help homeless people.
The move would be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in stamp duty will affect individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional revenue helping the government's efforts to limit the number of people who sleep on the street.
The allowance - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for the purpose of renting - could amount to up to three percent.
The State Treasury expects receipts to rise by up to 120 million pounds per year.
About 13 percent of newly built buildings in London are purchased by people with non-UK citizenship, leading to price hikes and making it difficult for first-time buyers to intervene in the property market.
Many of the rich areas - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp duty to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping property prices high by looting land but not using it, and asked Mrs May to abandon the quotas on affordable housing in order to correct Britain's "disgrace with housing".
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to "no blame" evictions.
He also wished to give the councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I shared that I would like to dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of making every new generation's lives better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open-door to those who wish to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes as easily as hard-working UK residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning their own home has drifted too far in time, and the affront to sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scotland team"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said that the "greatest ambition" of his career was to be the head coach of the Scotland national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman accepted the challenge to revive the club from north-east England, which is currently in third position in the First League, three points from first place.
He switched to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded one match for the B team and that was it," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up with the Scotland matches at Hampden, which as a child we watched together with my father, so the national team has always attracted me.
"However, this opportunity would only open if I was successful at club level."
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers were names such as Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach said he felt no anxiety as a successor to such established names at such a illustrious club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success at the moment will be measurable with a positive answer to the question 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Because in structure, base and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the Premier League," he said.
"It will not be easy to return to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross has only been manager for three years after spending some time as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months at Harts coaching staff.
He then helped keep Alloa out of the Third Division and turned St Mirren from a relegation team into a Championship winner the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than during his career as a footballer in Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was really at a crossroads," he recalls about the time he took on Alloa.
"I really believed that being a manager was the best career for me, including being an active player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making good money and having some significant successes.
But being a player is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I still face the same levels of stress and tension at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I really do, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin in my entire adult life."

Ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, study reveals
The summer heat has increased the revenue of struggling British pubs, but has built up more tension for restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars reported a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenue fell 4.8 percent, statistics show.
Peter Martin of business consultancy CGA, which compiled the statistics, said: "Due to the prolonged sunny weather and longer than expected England's participation in the World Cup, a similar pattern followed in July as June, when pubs saw growth of 2.8 percent, but restaurants received an even stronger blow.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
Pubs and beverage bars reported the best results in their growth, compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
Pubs with meals also suffered from the sunny weather, but not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales jumped 6.6 percent in the month, while food sales fell 3 percent."
Paul Newman, from RSM recreation and entertainment analysts, said: "These results continue the trend we noticed at the end of April.
The timing and influence of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home services sector.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year may be particularly painful in addition to fixed costs.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food service managers, and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring the much-desired holiday."
Total sales growth at pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand deployment.

One in five children hide a secret social network profile from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have a secret social media profile they hide from their parents and teachers, a study has revealed
Survey conducted among 20,000 secondary school students shows growth in fake Insta pages
News has raised fears that sexual content material is being published
Twenty percent of students said they had a "basic" profile they showed to their parents
One in five children - some one in 11 - creates a social network profile that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed growth in fake Insta accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content material is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a cleared "basic" profile that they showed to their parents, while also having secret profiles.
A mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenage child who encouraged others to "rape him".
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Conference (HMC), found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping their profiles secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eileed Doyle to be 'the voice of athletes' on Scotland's athletics board
Eileed Doyle was selected to join the Board of Athletics in Scotland as non-executive director at the Managing Authority's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's athlete with the most achievements and chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Elid enjoys tremendous respect in the athletic communities of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by attracting her," Beatty said.
Doyle said, "I'm keen to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help promote sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres finals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, adding to his total of four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator at the BBC, lost the ability to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was grueling work, but I've made a full recovery, I've learned to walk again, and today I'm doing mobility training!
Thanks for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for a breast pump that compares mothers to cows, sections online reviews
A company producing breast pumps has split online reviews with an ad that compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of the world's expected "first noiseless breast pump fit to carry", consumer technology company Elvie has released a joking music-video commercial to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides for nursing mothers to express themselves.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn full of hay, against the background of a song with lyrics including: "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not udder, it's my breasts".
The chorus continues: "Pump, pump, with them feed the babies, pump, pump, milk my girlfriends."
However, the ad posted on the firm's Facebook page caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the clip received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it downplayed the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"It is a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them away a few days after birth," someone wrote.

Another comment: "It is quite understandable that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added, "Such inadequate advertising."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she thought the song was "extremely funny".
"In my opinion, the idea is genius.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
Squeezing made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I accept it for what it is.
This product is genius," someone wrote.
Another comment: "This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who are straining themselves (often at their jobs or in toilets) and feel like 'cows'.
This is not an advertisement praising or condemning the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they danced with the discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who are breastfeeding feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is collected discreetly in a nursing bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while draining.
Ana Ballarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative market launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the pumping of breast milk and all the challenges associated with it, while showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Martha Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly transferred to tent camp on Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has skyrocketed, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, in part because sharp rhetoric and policy by the Trump administration has made it difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Typically, most guardians are undocumented immigrants who fear they risk staying in the country if they wish to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults in the family must provide fingerprints, and this data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wished to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of persons who are either guardians or are members of the guardians' family reside illegally in the country, with a large proportion of them being criminal aliens.
So we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Albens.
In an effort to cope more quickly with the registration of these children, authorities have imposed new rules that require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, as was the previous norm, according to shelter officials.
Many appear in a video conference call rather than in person to present their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those identified as unfit for admission will be deported as quickly as possible.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to shelter officials and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said this concern was growing at large facilities, such as the one in Tornillo, where signs that a child was having problems were more likely to be overlooked because of the scale of the location.
They added that moving children to the "tent city" without giving them enough time to prepare on an emotional level or to say goodbye to their friends can aggravate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish "occupational troops" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the civil war has been going on for eight years now.
Muallem, who also holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign troops were residing illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "they will be dealt with accordingly".
"They should withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said at the meeting.
Muallem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight this holy battle until all Syrian lands are cleared" of both terrorist organizations and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian troops, opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the land of the war-ravaged country.
Regarding refugees, Muallem said the conditions were tolerable and could return, accusing "some Western countries of "blowing groundless fears" that prompt refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to assist with these returns," he said.
"They are turning into a political issue something that is entirely a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given to Syria's reconstruction until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to stop the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib allowed for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Muallem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, which "will be destroyed".
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, made up of members of the government and opposition, soon to draft Syria's post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Muallem laid out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By this logic, Trump will win re-election in the 2020 election unless, as many Liberal viewers probably hope, his presidency is terminated prematurely because of impeachment and scandal.
This would no doubt be "The most dramatic end to a presidency ever!"
There are currently no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, primetime ratings have doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" tops cable TV ratings, with up to 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," says Neil Baer, executive producer of the ABC drama The Last Candidate, where a cabinet secretary becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovel, who is a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers riding in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked "Why?".
Mrs. Scovel told me that he replied, "Because it makes me laugh."
There's fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else that is shown on television, Washington's coming-out stories can determine the future of Roe vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, and the well-being of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, the desire to be an informed citizen does not correspond to six o'clock watching a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book Fear; Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-skinned pilot jacket ("cloth filled with arrogance" according to the Washington Post), and Stormy Daniels' startling descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I especially would never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does to make you feel like you're part of a reality show is to give you a little bit every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, in terms of changing participants and daily twists (bashing with the National Football League, praising Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're going to fall behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fliess this week, it was sunny on the north coast of Kauai, 80 degrees, but he had closed himself home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't separate from the TV, especially when Brett Kavanaugh had to face the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court depended on it.
"I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people would say, 'This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,'" Mr. Fliess told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Investments are flowing into the most contentious race in the early election for a seat in Congress
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th district received a stream of money, thanks to the rearrangement of congressional districts and hence two holders for the same seat.
The recently redeployed district in suburban Pittsburgh points to conservative Democrat Connor Lamb, who won his seat from another county in a partial election last spring.
Lamb faced another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, who significantly overlapped with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the parties' major funding institutions, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after the difficult victory in the widely debated March partial election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The position was held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts believe the Democrats have a slight advantage.
U.S. considers imposing sanctions on El Salvador over its support for China, then steps down
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a Department spokesman, said earlier this month.
But sanctions were envisaged only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in aid from America for the fight against drugs, with the aim of development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been excruciating for the Central American state with its unemployment rate and murder rate.
As domestic meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity that served as a follow-up to a similar gathering last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent an influx of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior management officials specified that their desire was for the conference to take place, effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has announced that he will participate in the conference, scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, diplomats say.
All three U.S. envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new strict announcements or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who wished to remain anonymous who agreed to participate in internal deliberations.
Their accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also wished to remain anonymous.
History of the Survey
The next move could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, with the report currently being significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also said to be directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump colluded with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our election.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to answer to this body just as he prepares to face the voters, as well as perhaps a jury made up of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable - nor that of his likes in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic need to make these choices that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'etat against Hitler, as long as the West had stood up to him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of massacres.
The course of history depends on such crucial moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
Americans are currently facing several such pivotal moments.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since that newspaper reported that last year he proposed secretly recording the president and speculated that he was not fit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein announced that the story in The Times was inaccurate.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is approved for the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And most of all, will we vote in the early congressional elections if it forces Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy faces a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail because I have learned my lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table, wearing a swastika.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrance of Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, being aware that a victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month would give them a significant chance to move on from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorans from playing his first game of the season before the 2-2 draw in question with Villarreal, but he believes that for Rangers this result could become a stepping stone to greater achievements.
"We won an important point because Villarreal are a good opponent," the 31-year-old footballer said.
"We went into the game hoping we could win something and we left with a point.
Maybe we could have even won at the end of the game, but overall the tie seems a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second.
We are looking forward to Thursday, another big night of our matches in Europe.
I hope that we will be able to fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match, because they achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can do our best and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely difficult after everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the club, but now things seem to be going in the right direction.
The team is good and the boys are really having fun, the training is fruitful.
I hope that we will be able to harness all the strength to forget last season and achieve the desired success."
Women worried about fears about their retirement savings
Despite the fact that study participants had a clear idea of what care they wanted to receive, few people discussed this with family members.
About half of the participants in a Nationwide survey said they discussed with their husbands the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent have spoken to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they haven't taken the steps to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance sector.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care to you if you do not state your wishes in advance.
Together with your counselor and your family, discuss where and how you want to be receiving care, as these decisions can be a crucial factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you with an idea of how to pay these costs.
Your decisions when choosing a financial institution for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with monetary value to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own funds - if you have the cash resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles right from the start.
Assign yourself a health care proxy so that you have a designated confidant to oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the idea of a proxy for financial matters.
You can choose a trustee to make the financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
State these details in writing to be prepared.
"It's not just about the financial aspect, it's also about who the doctors will be," Martin asks.
"What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan."
A man was shot several times with an air rifle at Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while walking home at night outside.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 a.m. British summer time, as a "random act".
The victim was unable to see his assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police are trying to draw witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died from a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the disrupted communications, relief organizations could not obtain information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu that was located closer to the earthquake's epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow beach strip on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which is an administrative region smaller than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also of importance to the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been struck repeatedly by a tsunami over the past 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian Disaster Recovery Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic "Pacific Ring of Fire" and is regularly decimated by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong tremor on December 26 on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra triggered a tsunami wave that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the entire Indian Ocean coastline, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake struck Indonesia's most populous island, Java, activating a tsunami that crashed in the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands and triggered a 10-meter tsunami wave that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation from the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was activated this time, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong tremors struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, meddling in a domestic violence notice, and resisting arrest, according to an Alaska State Police report released Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Palin was detained in the Mat-Su detention facility and under an unsecured bail of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, certainly", when asked about a plea, the media reported.
Palin faces punishment for three Class A misdemeanors, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and pay a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a class B misdemeanor punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently under review by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, meddling in the reporting of a crime of domestic violence and gun ownership under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claims he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son's aggressive behavior to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died from an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications networks have been cut off, with the number of dead expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social networks that show the moment of collision.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for New York terror attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the October attack on a bike lane near the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, wading pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" caused severe bodily harm, according to the notice of intent in connection with the death penalty request filed in the South District, New York.
According to the court document, both charges could end in a death sentence.
Weeks after the bombing, an expanded federal court panel issued Saipov with a 22-point indictment, including eight counts of racketeering-related murder commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and vehicle destruction.
The attack required "serious planning and intentionality", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's manner of doing so as "terrible, cruel and perverted".
"Saifulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anne-Laurie Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Early, Hernan Felucci and Alejandro Damian Panuco," the notification said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last sought a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in New York in a federal case was in 1953 - Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after a conspiracy conviction and espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an Uzbek by nationality, showed no sense of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, the indictment claims.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the indictment, consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"In our opinion, the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty verdict and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to seek a death sentence.
Conservative member of parliament says NIGEL FARAGE should lead Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people" today, during a protest at the Conservative conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should "feel the pressure" - with one member of Theresa May's own party suggesting he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonn, a Conservative MP, said in March in Birmingham that Britain "would have been out by now" if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces to reconcile with the party's deeply divided ranks was highlighted by Remain-supporting Conservatives who joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep his Chequers compromise plan, despite attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she would make progress in her attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and insisted that Eurosceptics and Labour choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bonn told protesters with a slogan "Getting out means getting out" in Solihull that he wanted them to "throw out Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr Farage should have been involved on an equal footing with the others and that he should have been given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have left by now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit, but we have to ditch the Chequers plan.
Stating his opposition attitude towards the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our laws in our own country".
Mr Bonn dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The notion that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is entirely false."
Conservative representative Andrea Jenkins also participated in the rally, telling reporters: "I'm just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists, who actually took to the streets and actually helped to get elected.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers maintain their position when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they intend to amend the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trusting each other - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to amend Brexit, and we're here today to say, 'We're not going to let you get away with this.'
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that helped us win Brexit, and we will never stop until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, supporters went on a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists had raised flags reading "Conservatives Against Brexit", following the group's launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis taunted the Conservatives about the party's application security issues when he opened at the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can deploy Canada's IT systems and all of Canada's technology and more, for unhindered border crossing, for free border-free trade in Ireland," he added.
"This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren says he will "consider seriously" running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "consider seriously the possibility of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a city council in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a persistent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Jeff Deal, who was joint chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She is at the center of speculation that she could take Trump's post in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the City Hall building since Trump's inauguration.
One of the attendees asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was high time "women went to Washington and repaired our damaged government, and that includes women at the top."
Arrest made over death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the shooting on Friday when LSU basketball player Wade Sims was killed.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, during a press conference at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
They posted video footage of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man seen in the footage.
Simms, a 20-year-old, was shot and killed near the Southern University area early Friday morning.
"Wade Simms was shot in the head, which ultimately led to his death," Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene, having a gun, and shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without issue and held in custody by the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A young man of six-six, raised in Baton Rouge, Simms was involved in 32 games with 10 outings as a starter last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after the team's instructions helped him beat Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the directions from the Mercedes team would have an important role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two turns, thus enabling Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first made a pit stop and let Hamilton handle the traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also hit a pit stop on the next lap and went out after Vettel, but Hamilton managed to overtake him after a daring maneuver and a "rubber to tire" drive, which forced the Ferrari driver reluctantly to vacate the inside of the track to avoid a penalty with added time after he had already closed his opponent's path with a dangerous double defensive maneuver on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back of the starting grid and was seventh after the end of the first lap.
He then even led for a fairly long period of the race, as he had decided to change his tyres later than the others, which would have allowed him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly overtake Kimi Raikkonen in the battle for the fourth position.
He finally came in for a pit stop on lap 44, but failed to catch up enough in the next eight laps and eventually Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day as Valtteri did a great job all weekend and showed himself to be a real gentleman when he let me get ahead of him.
The team did an outstanding job to win the top two places on the podium," said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally Saturday over her claim that she did not release Christine Blazey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court challenger Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a talk at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on how what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "evil and disgusting and insincere."
"Whatever can happen and the good that's happened in the last few days in the Senate when you see the anger, when you see angry people and evil and disgusting and insincere," he said.
"When you look at editions and distribution, and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
You know?
Diane Feinstein, did it spread from you?
Do you remember her answer... Did you release the document - "Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't distribute."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter detailing Ford's claims against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was circulated earlier in September - but Feinstein denies this distribution occurred from her office.
"I have not covered up Ford's claims, I have not disseminated its story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep confidentiality, and I kept confidentiality as she wished."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "I will tell you that it was very bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court challenger accused of sex crimes against three women, the president argued that Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
Look at the dishonor, shamelessness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to regain power and control," the President said according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars regained for Friday's Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants, winning the Dundee rematch 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants led early in the game with two goals after hitting Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney tied for the hosts before Dwyer regained the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals solidified their victory.
This is the third Elite League victory for Adam Keefe's boys, who made it out of the bottom to beat Dundi in Belfast 2-1 Friday night.
This was the fourth clash between opponents this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The blow that Dwyer opened the scoring with came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with Kendall McFaul's assist, and then David Rutherford doubled the avance, assisting Bovillier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquart helped levelling with the help of Cowney at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break, scoring a second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard again tied the chances with a powerful shot in the door at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time this game at the end of the second half, as he gave it his all and solidified the team's victory with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
The Giants, who have lost the last four games out of five games, are hosting Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died to make sure hundreds of people on board a plane could escape an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was lauded as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board was able to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are unaccounted for in a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami wave.
Strong aftershocks continued to strike the area, and many were trapped in the rubble of Palu City.
Although his colleagues were on the run to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Juffrey Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would be able to take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Control, Indonesia, Johannes Sireit, said this decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency announced that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Butong was restricted.
"We assume the death toll will rise as many bodies are still under the rubble, and many people cannot be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft brought aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings in more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.
There's marauding all over the minimarkets."
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is struggling to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's army: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was decimated by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reports one man missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which flew a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean, now reports that one person has been reported missing after earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon they could not contact a single male passenger.
The airline added that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in trying to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Boats of local people helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were admitted to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had passed the runway.
American Bill Jaynes, a passenger on the plane, claimed that the plane went very low.
"It's extremely nice," Janes says.
Janes said he and the others were able to run over the waist-deep water to reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He shared that the flight attendants panicked and screamed, as well as that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors repairing a nearby wharf also helped with the rescue effort by using an inflatable boat to get people to shore before the plane sank into the deep water of about 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Safe Aviation Network shows that over the past two decades, 111 people have died on flights with airlines registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any cases.
Analyst lays out the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution closed its statement on the case this Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett of the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the officers went to question Sanford.
Sanford stood trial on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that "it's a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicate that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett pointed out that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He has erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin with its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be presented to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscientious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative opinions about the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol argues that hip-hop has strayed from its origins of political statements and engagement with social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and promote conscientious hip-hop again.
Performers such as The Fugees and Common were revived in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York nanny sues couple after firing for 'racist' message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for dismissal due to discrimination after receiving a wrongly sent message from the mother, who complains that she is "another black woman".
The couple denies being racist, likening the claim to "blackmail".
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was stunned to find out that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first day at work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, and twice.
Upon realizing her mistake, the "awkward" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, arguing that the previous nanny, who was African-American, was not doing her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Morris was paid for a day's work then sent home in a taxi.
Morris is now suing the couple for compensation due to the dismissal, asking for the sum of $350 a day for the six-month arrangement for which she was originally hired, although she did not have a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do that," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "You're sure that's discrimination."
In response to the suit, the couple claimed they were not racist, adding that ending Morris' employment was the sensible action, as they feared they would not be able to trust her after they had insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have offended, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
Likening the claim to "blackmail", Plasco claimed that his wife gave birth only two months ago and was in a "very difficult position".
"You're going to attack someone in this state?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit was still under review, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, reprimanding them for their behavior and their logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn't feel a connection to a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Yankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the public, relates of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it's published.
It's a lot of fun now that we're aware of Paddington's huge success."
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a toy bear, would have felt optimistic about a possible rejection of the book, adding that he was welcoming the 60th anniversary of the book's publication "with mixed feelings" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she described as "an important member of our family", she added that her father had secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
"He was a rather modest man and he was not a braggart," she said.
"But because you felt Paddington was so real, it's like having a child who's accomplished something: you're proud of him, even though it's not really your doing.
I think he kind of took Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors struggled in vain to save her life.
"Over constantly rang to say that the situation was really bad, that he did not expect to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
"Then Nade called me to say that she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The drugs given to her by doctors to keep her heart going slowly stopped working and left her system.
She's been gone for a while before, and that's how it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all of this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to pull myself together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who is still mourning the loss of her daughter, boards the plane with the other passengers, who have no idea of the ordeal she is going through.
"Nobody understood," she shares.
"I had my head down and all the time my tears were dripping.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt this all-consuming sense of empathy with Over.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Grief-stricken women put up postcards to prevent suicides from a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide attempt to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put up on a bridge in Wales postcards with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she says.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old from Lidney, says her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile brightened every room."
However, he had given up his job before he left, and was in a "really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his own life.
Ms Davis said: "I am constantly worried that this will have any consequences."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to let people know there's someone to go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Do not remain silent - you must speak."
Mrs. Humphries, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't share that he felt depressed or depressed or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas - when the children opened their presents, he didn't look at them or anything."
She said it was a scary trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: "It opens a gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to move on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in question as FBI launches investigation
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wanted - an investigation of limited duration and limited scope - maybe we could join forces," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "failing out" despite the entrenched non-partisan blocking.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their reluctance is for the sake of the moment itself.
The snap election is just five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans don't perform well, their attempts to get their representative elected to the state's highest court will be seriously hurt.
George W. Bush called senators, inviting them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and with his help he met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of fugitives 'reduces' under Kim
A South Korean lawmaker claims the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 fugitives last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts demanded by human smugglers, are the key factors.
There was no official comment from Pyongyang.
The majority of North Korean refugees eventually obtained citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, and it is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which separates the two Koreas.
China considers fugitives to be illegal migrants rather than refugees, often forcibly repatriating them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalemate in nuclear disarmament talks.
This happened after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to basically work for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho blamed U.S. sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security, and under these circumstances, there is no way we can be the first to unilaterally disarm," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was too unstable to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had reacted that way, they would have called her 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his inaugural address, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and moved when discussing his family and school years.
He also strongly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated attack on the person" organized by liberals who are unhappy that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi pointed out that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it became clear that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these allegations and the way he's prosecuting the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi denied it when asked if she would try to discredit Kavanaugh if he was appointed and in case the Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll put it this way - if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's unfit not only to enter the Supreme Court, but the court he's in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Washington Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings regarding the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reject certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to walk into court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi concluded.
And women need to be mastered.
It's a legitimate criticism, after months and years of spreading rage, and she can't accept it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I got tremendous help from a woman who was a CEO somewhere, who shared that she cries when she gets angry too, but she has developed her technique, thanks to which when she gets angry and cries, she tells her interlocutor, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just goes on.
I thought it was genius."
Tears are allowed when anger is expressed, partly because they are misunderstood in the first place.
One of my clearest memories of a previous job, in an office mostly with men, is how once, as I sobbed with inexpressible rage, an older woman grabbed me by the neck - a chilling supervisor I had always been a little afraid of - and she dragged me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they did it to you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a yacht called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why she should not consider running for president herself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted was for another one to come along.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because she was late in the campaign, she fell behind in fundraising and decided that she would not stay in the race if she failed to raise US$2 million.
The battle is doomed to failure in advance.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would only give $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During her speech, in which she stated that she would not continue with an official campaign, she was flooded with so many feelings - gratitude to the people who supported her, discontent against the system that made it so difficult to raise money and be able to appeal to voters rather than delegates, as well as anger against sexism that she became emotional.
"One might think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalls how the media reacted.
"Someone might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
How the US-China trade war could serve Beijing
The first shots in the US-China trade war were deafening and, while the battle is yet to pick up pace, a rift between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning salvo this year, taxing key elements of China's exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tensions came this week with the new tariffs affecting US$200 billion worth of output (150 billion pounds) with effective taxation of half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Each time, Beijing retaliated with retaliatory new tariffs of five to ten percent on US $60 billion worth of goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against any U.S. strike, and soon the world's second-largest economy is not expected to ignore this.
Getting Washington to back down means giving in to demands, but bowing his head publicly to Washington would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure of the trade war with the US could help China in the long run by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in both Washington and Beijing could create the conditions for an economic crisis in either country is actually more dangerous than observers previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research associate on Asia-related issues with the Center for a New American Security expert group.
Syria 'ready' for refugees' return, foreign minister says
Syria has announced that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for assistance in rebuilding the country devastated by the war, which has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem pointed out that conditions in the state are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas devastated by terrorists in order to return them to their normal state.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the state, which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living there are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in rebuilding the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from countries that have financed the rebels would not be accepted.
Europe wins at Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europe team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
Thus, the United States had six consecutive losses on European soil and had not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the championship crown in the tournament after the team, led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, reached the necessary 14.5 points that guaranteed victory over the United States.
The US star, Phil Mickelson, who performed poorly for most of the tournament, threw his first shot at the 16th hole (with a "par" 3) in the water, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari performed well in all rounds, becoming one of four players in the tournament's history to reach a 5-0-0 balance since the race was held in the current format after 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost decisively with 5&4 to the player in the team of Europe, located at the lowest place in the rankings - Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World ranking leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, for whom this is probably the last participation of the Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cup appearances, became the European with the most points earned in the tournament of all time, increasing his asset to 25.5 points this year.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can get the bowl up again.
In everything, the most important thing is the team and I am happy that I was able to help," shared the excited Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He passed the baton to fellow countryman John Ram, who beat American legend Tiger Woods 2&1 on singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud that I beat Tiger Woods, after all I grew up watching him play," said the 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and his total Ryder Cup balance is now 13-21-3.
Strange statistics about one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles - an indicator by which he is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf in all days of the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furrick said after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning, we cornered the Europa team.
There was a fight.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players performed very well.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the Professional Golfers Association of the United States and our Ryder Cup Committee, and look only forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can't help but take off your opponent's hat.
We were just outplayed."
