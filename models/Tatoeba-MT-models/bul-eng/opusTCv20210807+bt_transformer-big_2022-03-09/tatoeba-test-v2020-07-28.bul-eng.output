I think you've done enough.
When did you start learning French?
I'll come to your house.
No one else offered to help.
Get your coat.
He had a hard time breathing.

Her hair is long.
I put it in your room.
I thought you were going out with Tom seriously.

He drinks his coffee clean every time.
I don't have any information on Tom.
She found a job as a typist.
Let me handle this.
They lied to you.
I have to go ask Tom.
You should have worked harder.
Her sweater is purple.

Clearly, Americans can't even solve their own problems, so how do they ever imagine they're capable of dealing with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak clearly so that everyone can hear you.
I'm ticklish.
From now on, I'm going to study French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
It was awfully cold yesterday.
I forgot to give him the message.
I graduated in American literature in college.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
We'd gone mad with worry.
I think you'll be pleased.
The teenagers left.
I wish I was rich.
I've barely started.
If you need anything, just call.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
I learned a lot of things.
She bought a toy for the child.
I didn't get an answer from you. I was wondering if my email ever got to you.

Do you live in Sasayama?
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
What will the weather be tomorrow?
Does he have any children?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
There is no way to hide this fact from her.
I don't think you understand what's important.
Some say that French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I like to take pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French wines?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom sat on a log.
The girls were dancing in the gym.
She is convinced that her son is still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
Finally I stopped in front of the old house and saw the town once more.
You won't see anything without a flashlight.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There are many ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit, I snore.
We've been using this insecticide for 2 years.
Come help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, too bad!
The bus arrived empty.
We need to keep helping Tom.
My mother has a nice handwriting.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the meeting.
Tom buttoned his shirt and then put on his tie.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she's nice to everyone.
Ken plays football every day.
You're welcome again anytime.
I don't want tea, I want coffee.
Lawyers and car mechanics are the people I trust the least.

Can you eat raw oysters?
What kept you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train traveled 500 miles in an hour.
She gave me this CD.
The principal considered firing Tom, but decided not to.
I have to take it off.
Tom sat by the window.
I don't think you really want to do it.
For the most part, the students were from the West Bank.
Could this be love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom has two children.
The police should not take bribes.
I was in the mountains.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?
Travelers through southern Germany will see farms with solar panels everywhere they look.
Don't look in the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone ringing.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that no one said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I messed up your plans.
I'm going to ask you to translate this report into French.
Nobody's confused.
They all jumped.
Many merchants were robbed during the unrest.
Why do I have to learn French?
She's not tall.
That's true!
We're grateful for your help.
Since we've worn clothes, we haven't known each other.
Let's get started.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom is lower than average height.
I found the key.
I know this is important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful blouse.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who are worried about you.
I don't have any pencils.
I really don't know Tom that well.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
He's lived here for the last ten years.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Shit.
She calls me Kenji.
I have the information you requested.
In a mysterious way, a sense of humor is linked to national peculiarities.
Swimming is one of the things Tom likes to do.
He'll be back tomorrow.
He forgot to feed the dog.
I need to look into things.
I'll watch you.
I once wanted to be an astrophysicist.
Tom vomited blood.
This camera is Tom's.
I'm sick.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red tie.
You want me to turn it down a little bit?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me to do.
You can do it, go ahead, I'm with you.
Did he stop Mike from drinking?
Aren't you glad to see me?
I really couldn't have done it without you.
I'm not mad at you, I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to drive you home?
Did you and my younger sister leave at the same time?
The match was postponed to an unknown time.
His brother studied a lot.
Ken has arrived in Kyoto.
Have you seen Tom?
I wish I was taller.
Do many people visit the museum?
The thieves robbed the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He comes from within to speak French.
Tom helped Mary put on her coat.
That kabuki book could be expensive.
Sorry.
Is this your book?
I've always wanted to learn French.
Are you going to call Tom, or do you want me to?
Don't be scared of Tom.
He leaned on his elbows.
What is the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's obnoxious.
What is the minimum wage in New Zealand?
I bargain with him for the price.
You can speak French, right?
My father rarely smokes.
His futile attempts to seduce her showed him that he had the wrong address; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're soul mates.
The boss is very upset.
It doesn't change anything.
I have a meeting with him at noon.
The invitation said there'd be popcorn and soft drinks.
Tom looks pale.
I hope this helps.
What did you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I've worked with Tom for a long time.
He's a lot older than Ken.
Where are the showers?
Mike ran very fast yesterday.
Do you have a European Health Insurance Card?
None of the balls are yellow.
I know someone you should meet.
I was rude.
Kuala Lumpur is worth a visit.
I couldn't get them to understand me.
You speak French, too?
I just recently started learning French, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom tries to get an answer from Mary.
A boy, not older than five years, asked Tom how to get to the post office.
Tom still lives with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's asleep.
Are those explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
Anne has no sisters.
Tom has small hands.
He arrived two days early.
Was it a nice trip?
He made me a suit.
Men make houses, women make homes.
Where's the bathroom?
They usually come home before us.
I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I won't be able to get Tom across the bridge.
If I were you, I'd apply for this job.
The patient was discharged from the hospital.
My internet connection is slow.
We have to keep working.
Hurry up, we're going to be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was fascinated by her operatic singing.
You'll find it.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's with Tom now?
His concert was very good.
Another crowd of tourists arrived.
The door snapped and closed.
I'm hungry!
It's easy to talk to Tom.
The twin brothers look exactly alike.
Don't hang out with Tom.
I didn't get the joke.
I bet you know that.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to go with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Could you repeat that, please?
How much money do you have?
And I was sick.
I have some very bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Given how long I've been learning French, I should be able to speak it better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
You want to buy a shirt?
I think you have the right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to attend Mary's celebration.
It won't be just you there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happily.
I'm mad at myself.
This was done by Tom himself.
You wouldn't believe what people throw away.
I quit smoking for a year.
Don't carry much luggage when you travel.
I have Tom's picture here.
I didn't tell you everything.
They work both ways.
Tom is not welcome here.
Accuse her of lying to him.
There's no point in fooling yourself, you know she's playing games with you.
George is very enthusiastic about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He must be given an advantage over the others.
I tricked you.
Take him with you.
Wait just a moment.
I swim once a week.
I waited an hour and a half.
He mocked me in public.
The bulb burned.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
Ah, I was sick.
We're in position.
Shrink it.
What do you say we have dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
This is the picture I took of Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I never spoke French to Tom.
We all assumed that Tom could speak French.
Tom went back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I would like to learn more about museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You're not gonna believe this.
I'm looking for a house.
I don't feel well.
Why are you early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a night owl.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, don't you?
Do what you will; but I will hinder it if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I have to trust Tom.
I think I'll learn to swim during the holidays.
Which way is the beach.
Are the Giants playing tonight?
I have a feeling he won't let me unhook so easily.
It'll be 5:30 in a minute.
School starts at half past eight.
Tom's taking a bath.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken jumped the wall.
The top of the mountain is covered with snow.
A hug from you will make me happy.
When are you leaving?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
There's a really good restaurant right by the beach that I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
Coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the image.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I completely erased you from my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
Are you thinking French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What is the minimum wage in Lithuania?
Here's the hospital I was born in.

Provisional measures will have no effect on drug dependence.
I don't know where I left the keys.
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Sentenced to death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I don't have anything.
Think with your head for once.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of a new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
Chat-pat I'm thinking about it.
Don't you have anything else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you pick up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We had to obey their request.
Pick the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so go to bed early.
That was just plain stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I have nothing to offer.
I talk to my employees in French.
This is a picture of my sister.
Tom has a hard time dealing with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her some advice.
The room was so smoky I could hardly breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He certainly loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
She doesn't seem to be feeling well.
Did Spot go too?
I promise I'll bring him back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out!
Tom wears a trench coat.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I have to go talk to Tom.
How about we study together in the library?
I have a job to do.
The job offer is still in place.
Your shirt is missing a button.
I have to go out for a while.
Green suits you.
Fingers crossed.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see this one?
My uncle gave me this watch.
True friendship is forever.
Tom is used to working outdoors.
Tom pulled the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
You're kidding me!
Let's go back.
I'm getting on the bus.
Tom learns French every day.
In this store they are engaged in kitchen supplies.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom did not immediately respond.
You're supposed to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works in that bakery is nice.
Please pour me another cup of coffee.
Alice might come.
How do you do that?
I had a good time.
I'll stay until the day after tomorrow.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Does anyone on your team speak French?
Looks like it's going to start snowing.
I've never seen anything like it.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never been to Mount Fuji.
You don't play golf, do you?
Tom doesn't work anymore.
It's probably nothing important.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumped.
What is the minimum wage in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has sparked heated debate.
Eat one live frog every morning and nothing worse will happen to you throughout the rest of the day.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
Unemployment is rising.
I couldn't sleep last night.
Russia lost 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy's smiling.
If you're going to France, you need to refresh your French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
We're learning French at school.
He said so himself.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I won't be able to tell you what happened.
I think you should give it up.
Please be patient.
Your joke goes too far.
I had a really good time today.
Christopher Columbus drank unfiltered seawater.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need this.
Everyone's hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom is a professional baseball player.
Tom wished he was still single.
I have three children.
Let me sleep for ten more minutes.
My uncle gave me the watch.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
Last week I had pizza every day.
I promise I'll bring it back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
You're obviously mistaken.
His daughter has become a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's at his desk, writing something.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I opened a checking account.
He was here at the time.
I put my shoes on right away.
He felt uncomfortable in the presence of his father.
Your shoes are untied.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took off his coat.
I can swim in the river.
Do you do French every day?
Don't make so much noise, please.
You're pretty good at French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one thought his words were important.
It's a strange problem.
I don't understand that.
What place do you live in?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time for lunch.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got an A.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They're going to play basketball after school.
Those clothes look good on you.
I couldn't say no.
That's surprising.
I heard someone come in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they take a bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something personally with you.
He was transported to the hospital by helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he discovered that Mary had disappeared.
I'm sewing my shirt.
Coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill is engaged to Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was home alone.
In Esperanto, nouns end in "o". A plural is formed by adding "j".
Tom wants to be a doctor when he grows up.
Don't I get a hug?
I'm older than any other student in my class.
I buy tapes.
We're going to need Tom's help.
How tall is your brother?
Come visit us.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Jane's in serious trouble.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't taken a shower in three days.
Triangles do not have four angles.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What is the minimum wage in Romania?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you going to get home?
I wash my clothes.
I've heard that French is a difficult language.
I'm not quite fed.
Soon you'll stop thinking about her.
Let me see.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big firm.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Go upstairs and go to bed.
Come on, touch it.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years did you learn French?
Carol went back to her hotel.
Do you like that color?
Please be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered in snow.
Let's get out of here.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
He got off the train.
Mary is dating two people at the same time.
Still no sign of Tom.
Hand it to me.
Did you manage to get everything you wanted done?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was woken up at five o'clock.
I was afraid I might be too late.
Tom says he can relate to the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What do you want to tell me?
I'm looking for something not so expensive.
Tom finds it much easier to speak in English than in French.
I think you'd be surprised.
Next time, I'll make more of an effort.
I've done my job already.
He's a hero.
I don't have any requirements.
Her charm is a mixture of mirth and kindness.
I should have listened to you.
I have brown hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
It's almost there.
I like that color.
My grandmother had surgery in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you and Tom.
I don't think that's true.
I have three cameras.
Ask them to call Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I have a chance to return the favor.
Tom went through the drawer to see if he had any pens he could use.
This requires careful deliberation.
Tom won't believe it.
I need to know the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We ran after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I was young.
Be more specific.
Tom's French is really quite good.
Isn't the weather great!
That doesn't bother me.
I don't want to belong to the elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You have to study hard.
I'll be back soon.
Sam, ask Tom.
Tom explained things in detail.
Don't let Tom get away with it.
He played football with an empty can.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm on vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
Better put a sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process achieves good results.
By this is meant his ignorance.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French is not good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are they criminals?
Can you take six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll throw him a farewell party.
What club are you a member of?
Atsushi may have been ill.
Tom didn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth re-reading over and over again.
We're working together now.
Return to your seat.
He graduated from Cambridge with honors.
I have to bring her back tonight.
I have to start getting ready.
Does Tom learn French at school?
Which shoes are good?
We definitely worked hard.
I will postpone my trip to Scotland until it is warm.
He began to justify himself.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do this.
How old are your kids?
I'll stay until tomorrow.
Please call a doctor!
I think Tom might share your feelings.
I gave up.
You don't know half of it.
This is the picture I took of Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat herself.
I'm starving!
I'll help you get better at it.
My dad goes jogging every morning.
I saw Tom walking along the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't get up too fast.
She gave away all her dolls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you going to do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Walk away.
It's a big city.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim is dressed very attractively.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.
It's okay to create a webpage, just be careful not to violate someone's copyright.
Tom protected his wife.
She has wonderful handwriting.
The fingers of the hand are five: thumb, index finger, middle finger, ring finger and pinky.
The foil is made of polyethylene.
I solved the task with ease.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
How much does a taxi go out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is this yours, Tom?
I don't have many English books.
We have until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
Enthusiastic began his respectable enterprise.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, the local cowboys laughed at him.
He seems to be in a hole.
I think you should come see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary does.
Be more specific.
I'm on leave this week.
I wash my socks.
I promise I won't do that again.
I just gave blood.
He knows neither French nor German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
I have no doubt of his sincerity.
Please open the package.
It's on me.
I have no idea who he is.
Could you tell me your name, please?
These kinds of mistakes are inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Did you watch the game?
This is your home.
The losses were heavy on both sides.
I'll follow your lead.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something warm to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary that it was time for them to leave.
She wears makeup every morning.
Don't forget the celebration tonight.
Would you prefer to speak in French?
Wow, that's cool.
Don't make nice eyes on me.
I have no money.
Millie's eating bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't have done this without you.
Tom's not used to living in the city.
Keep an eye on Tom.
Jane went out shopping.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I wouldn't be able to go.
The long skirts are now out of date.
He does very well with children.
Come in, please.
We were really having fun.
Tom hates that.
It's true that she's dead.
Don't make a habit of it.
It finally stopped snowing and the weather warmed up.
She made no particularly light hints as to what she wanted for Christmas.
The students did not remember what they read in this book.
I study French every day.
I heard every word.
Where did you take off your socks?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons, used properly, are useful.
What are we going to eat?
Keep it a secret.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do this.
She gave me permission to use her vocabulary.
He's three years older than her.
Don't get your hopes up.
What is the price of this umbrella?
Mom, can you hand me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find it.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you've changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good at sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to succeed.
I found out he's a genius of chemistry.
You can't just walk around talking bad about people.
I had a meeting at 2:30, but I got stuck in traffic and couldn't get there in time.
They went to the Maritime Museum.
Tom goes to great lengths to improve his French.
A lot of time was wasted.
They weren't talking.
I didn't call you a fool.
I feel like speaking French today.
You want to tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it personally.
We're all connected.
A word of support when you fail is worth more than an hour of praise when you succeed.
Are you sure you don't want me to drive you home?
It was finished.
His shirt was stained with gravy.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You won't be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a fur coat.
I promise I won't do it again.
I made Anne a doll.
What did you graduate from, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
The story is very interesting to me.
I've read this book.
That was a good year for you.
It was cleaned.
I can't do that.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom a present.
One thing's for sure, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly guy.
I was convicted.
Tom was recently told he had cancer.
Tom came home on a bus.
For me, a meeting in the afternoon is a better option.
What do you have to do?
Tom studied French for three hours last night.
Raise your hand.
What's that?
It was too easy.
I travel a lot.
Here's the hospital I was born in.
I never liked biology.
I am very much indebted to you for your kindness.
Let's split the prize fifty-fifty.
Squeeze my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think you'd better lie down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
I need to know.
Do you like to travel?
Your plan failed.
Tom had a big party at his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced out of school.
I just finished breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened one time.
How long will you have to wait?
Tom is the guy who told me when the meeting was going to be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers began to return home.
I have a problem, I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary to play with his children.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy looks so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.
Don't talk about people behind their backs.
She has reached adulthood.
Come with me for a walk.
I'd love to see the movie.
He who is well prepared has no worries.
Yesterday I had fun watching TV.
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees on whose leaves the silkworms live.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I have news for Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let this happen again.
My joints hurt.
I've tried everything I know.
Why are people afraid of her?
He's been battling hepatitis for six months, but he seems to have only recently begun to recover.

You think?
He learned to swim.
You really can't swim?

I'm too short.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
I've got pus coming out of my gums.
I can't do it alone.
I hope you're right.

Are you looking closely?
A few minutes later, the phone rang.
She wasn't even there.
Jane is from Australia.
Close the door, please.
Tom finally went.

Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is that your family?

I think Tom is afraid of you.
Why did you run away?
What's your favorite bird?
You can study here.
Let me help you.
You wish!
I'm afraid I've offended you.
There's nothing to worry about.
This is my house.

I think you need to get out now.
Please go.
I thought you didn't like Tom.
Tom seems really happy.
Until yesterday, I'd never heard Tom speak French.
She's French.
Soldiers are used to danger.
I know a little French.
Please write your contact address here.
Enjoy your meal!
I knew you'd find Tom.
We arrived first.
Can you make it?
Police found a body washed ashore not far from here.
We all speak French.
The gentleman knows best the value of his own life.
I appreciate you coming to get me.
Make sure you turn off the TV before you go to sleep.
And my hands were shaking.
From now on, be more careful.
Tom jumped into the cold water.
Are you registered?
If there is no life after death, you'd better do something with that life.
I hope things work out for you, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
The hallway is slippery, be careful.
Languages such as Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slavic roots.
Tom has to do this now.
You shouldn't say that thing to your parents.
Let's get this straight!
She's the woman I gave the gift to.
Let me go alone.
I don't understand what he said.
This situation is ridiculous.
This land belongs to Tom.
I think you should meet Tom.
Do not add annotations.
He's not here yet.
Muahahaha, your soul will be mine!
Many of my friends can speak French.
He plays guitar well.
Have you played Minecraft?
Nancy's afraid of dogs.
You'd be surprised what people think.
Are you currently taking any medications?
The tree is burning.
I heard every word you said.
I haven't said yes yet.
I have to admit I'm sorry.
Jack speaks English.
I want to see you.
I'm not jealous.
We took turns driving.
Can I borrow your coat?
My father will cook me a delicious meal tomorrow morning.
My TV's broken.
Tom just hung up.
Are you prepared?
I won't believe it until I hear it from Tom.
Tom can't see you.
I bet you're busy.
Come and see us.
Looks like you've had a rough day.
Tom doesn't give up.
But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't talked to Tom yet.
Are you involved?
What did you do with the camera?
I kept filming.
There are fewer and fewer teenagers working today.
Why am I still listening to this?
Please don't.
Tom's handwriting isn't very pretty, but it's legible.
Shoichi's face turned pale.
An electric current can generate a magnetic field.
Would it bother you if I turned on the radio?
I have things to do tomorrow.
The tower was smashed to smithereens.
America is very big.
I heard a car pull up.
Send her my regards.
Is your woman blonde, or brunette?
I'm out riding my bike.
The men carried the boy to the hospital.
They were talking too fast to understand what they were saying.
Tom's hurt, call an ambulance!
Are you sure Tom knows what he has to do?
Can we trust her?
This is the camera that Tom took the pictures with.
Let's watch TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I have to go.
What's the whole story?
Don't push me.
What are your plans for Christmas?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.
You've been given an opportunity.
Could you put the dishes in the sink?
We found out where he lives.
It's not that deep.
He's a great scientist.
She wants a divorce.
I found the new magazine very interesting.
Maybe we can help Tom.
We set out on a journey full of hope.
I'll be here.
I don't feel like it.
I think you're really amazing.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom helped Mary move the cupboard.
Tell Tom to explain.
What's your relationship with him?
I'm Tom Hunter.
That's a little weird to me.
Can you do it yourself?
In spring, the days get longer.
Mary let Tom kiss her.
I've never seen you cry.
Sometimes I hear my father singing in the bathroom.
English is spoken in Singapore.
I eat bread.
That application was denied.
You were right.
He was tired, and yet he went to help them.
Tom's not going to school next week.
Do as I say.
The kids are already tired.
You want to see a French movie, don't you?
We played to win.
What's in the coffee?
The bulb's burned.
I have to give Tom his money back.
As many books as he has, so do I.
They didn't find Tom.
Are you sure you don't want to wait until tomorrow?
I'll always remember your kindness.
I've smelled it before.
Everybody dies.
I don't understand.
Give me a hammer.
He hates shopping.
I think you'll be pleased.
I didn't tell him everything.
I don't want her to give up.
Mary is a bookworm.
I think you're capable of anything.
He objected to her plan.
I don't think we should do this.
You won't be alone.
Looks like the dog wants to eat something.
This box is a little heavier than it should be.
It's a famous mountain.
I could make you happy.
He told me how to get to the museum.
He likes to go fishing.
Is Tom still in school?
Texas is almost twice the size of Japan.
It's either you or them!
I hope it's not too late.
His clothes always smell bad.
I think you should listen to me.
I forgot your number.
I've only been there once.
Put your jacket on the hanger by the door.
Tom lives three blocks off the coast.
He's something of a little celebrity.
I love pizza very much.
I'll try it again.
Just answer the question.
Leave it for another man.
Tom admitted he was scared.
If you listen a little more closely to what the teacher says, you'll probably understand.
I think you should check under the bed.
The movie wasn't as much fun as the book.
I wasn't into the job.
I think you're perfect.
Every human being is a part of the whole, which we call the Universe - a part limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of its consciousness. This illusion is a kind of prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and attachment to our closest people. Our task should be to free ourselves from this prison, expanding the circle of our compassion, so that it embraces all living beings.
He will surely come.
I know it.
Aren't you going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
Do I have to fill out this form in French?
This local newspaper is published once a week.
I don't know who's who.
It's almost three o'clock.
I want to know more about you, Tom.
He's just become a principal.
We study French.
I think Tom and Mary like each other.
What is that thing?
Never give dog food to your cat.
I'm having trouble with French grammar.
I slapped him across the face.
I'll make you happy.
You won't believe it.
Do I have to open everything?
Now it's totally different.
You're always late.
Let's keep going.
The walls were painted light brown.

Can't you do something?
Lucy is from America.
Do you really want to work in Boston?
Tom's not lying down.
Are you involved?
It's too big.
Tom just got back from Boston.
Ask again later.
He's my older brother.
She became famous.
She declined his invitation.
We pray for peace.
I think you'll find it very interesting.
I didn't insult you on "fool."
He and I are friends.
Our best friend is a doctor.
There's something about Tom that makes me nervous.
Both of Tom's parents were educators.
Don't play baseball here.
Does Tom live far from here?
Bad weather wouldn't let me go.
She's a nice girl.
Bob's a nice guy.
Looks like he's happy.
I've got blisters on my legs.
Why is that so funny?
Follow my example and have a glass of wine.
Are you John?
I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to know when Tom is going to leave.
She read the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He shot at me.
Dogs are allowed.
Everyone thinks about changing the world, but no one thinks about changing themselves.
She wants a divorce.
You have to study hard.
Did you accept his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
I heard gunshots.
I didn't mean to embarrass you.
Who did you translate that for?
If there is a desire, there is a way.
I think Tom made a big mistake.
If you relax and rest, you'll feel much better.
Are you done with breakfast?
I have some old computers.
Tom wondered where Mary had spent her childhood.
Are you coming or not?
Do you speak Georgian?
Both Tom and Mary drew their weapons.
Do cats dream?
Do you know this girl?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
This is the hotel where Tom usually stays.
Tom was sweating.
You better not go.
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
Let's go ask her.
We usually talk in French.
I'd like a blouse to match that jacket.
I have no idea what Tom said.
He's kind of a star.
I thought maybe Tom was your boyfriend.
You're always complaining.
The milk is sour.
The second lesson is very easy.
I love your name.
We have to protect our children.
I'll stay home.
Take one of these.
What is your relationship with him?
The devil's custom must be forgotten.
My brother says he's not afraid of the dark.
Tom, I really hate him.
The problem was I had nothing to say to him.
I think Tom was really enjoying himself.
I wouldn't do that.
Why don't you take off your coat?
Let's have a serious talk about your future.
I've got some calls to make, too.
Whatever happens, we'll make them talk.
Would you be so kind as to close that window?
The old couple went on a journey around the world.
When I woke up, there was no one at home, and I was abandoned all day.
Math is my favorite subject.
What day do you usually take off?
Tom went back to get his coat.
I'd better go see what Tom found.
Tom's back home aiming for mud.
Have you actually tried?
A storm prevented the plane from taking off.
Tell me you have good news.
Which browser do you use?
I remember what he said.
What is the minimum wage in your country?
I think you should think again.
I missed you so much.
What kind of reader will you get - Kindle, Nook or Kobo?
Is this your book, Mike?
I usually run every morning.
The bell rings at eight o'clock.
Mr. Smith has been charged with a breach of contract.
Ken runs faster than you.
They had a talk.
Are you feeling sleepy, honey?
She gave birth to twins.
Five gallons normal, please.
I haven't been here long.
Take care.
This is very big.
I think you'd be surprised.
Do you speak German?
Put on a robe.
I bought some books from the bookstore.
Be loved.
Yesterday there was a terrible accident.
He answered the questions correctly.
Put on your hiking shoes and don't waste time.
Why are you here so early?
Judging by your great complexion, you seem to have spent most of your vacation on the beach.
It's probably going to snow tomorrow.
I have no idea who Tom is.
Laura may have been ill.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Tom might object.
She was perfect.
I have to keep trying.
There used to be an art museum in this area.
I thought maybe your feelings had changed.
Sooner or later, his luck will run out.
Looks like it's going to rain tonight.
Anne doesn't have any sisters.
Is it really that hard to speak French?
When was the last time you traveled by train?
Tom saw it too.
I'm not trying to pressure you.
You're running.
Don't stay in bed unless you can make money out of bed.
Tom has to do this now.
I could make you happy.
My dear, if the meal isn't ready by seven o'clock, I'll go to a restaurant.
He let me wait a long time.
I'll go right now.
They made us work all night.
He likes English very much.
I heard about your party.
They need to change their attitude.
Do you want me to repeat the question?
The book is interesting.
She was young.
They're hiding in the closet.
What is the minimum wage in Russia?
He loves her.
Try to figure out when the train is leaving.
You should take French more seriously.
I want to go there one more time.
It's really stupid of you to say something like that.
They have to pay in advance.
Do you like music?
He was born and raised in Tokyo.
I pretend to work.
She waited until the water was boiling before making tea with her.
I think Tom speaks French well.
Tom has to go.
He was very patient.
It is not at all likely that they will come at this late hour.
The teacher claimed that in three months he would make sure that we all spoke French without stumbling.
I caught three fish yesterday.
He goes there every day.
There's been an accident.
Have you ever heard anyone speak French?
And not a word about what I told you.
We want to rent an apartment in the city.
I think you should come down here.
We arrived yesterday afternoon by train.
Tom left, but Mary's still here.
Pick your favorite rocket.
I'll treat you to sushi.
That's it for today.
My brother claims he's not afraid of the dark.
Save a man, eat a cannibal.
Everything looks fine.
Are you sure you don't want me to help you?
Tom speaks French terribly.
Don't you take credit cards?
Tom drinks water.
Did he propose to you?
Do you want me to help you?
You don't have to go.
Please give me an envelope.
What is Tom afraid of?
You're always singing.
I completely forgot about Tom.
I wouldn't be so sure.
My father was about to leave when the phone rang.
He was asking about you.
Ken never went to Kyoto.
The fog prevented him from seeing far away.
Anne is a cheerleader.
I'm trying to learn English.
Tom went to the post office to send a letter.
Look closely at the map on the wall.
It may not be enough.
Don't send me any more notes.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
I think you'll find it very interesting.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
I haven't taken a shower in three days.
I've lost my form.
Get me a chair, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.
Maybe you'd be happier at another job.
I like your shirt.
This is very important.
Thank you for your work.
Drive straight down the road, and when you pass the traffic light, you're there.
Do what you want.
Some people would certainly ask, why don't we just pack up and get out of Afghanistan?
Take off your socks, please.
I don't waste ammo.
I'd like to get a picture of you.
Please put it away.
"What brand is your car?" "It's a Ford."
I tried to be your friend.
His wife's second cousin was a member of the Jewish Board of Governors.
Could you help me translate that?
America has enemies.
Have you seen Tom?
We'll be back.
Give it back!
Say hello to Jimmy for me.
I haven't talked to Tom in three weeks.
Stop whining.
I know what Tom's doing here.
I know a man who speaks French well.
I think you were wrong.
He didn't mind staying up all night.
You probably already know about our company.
I think you've asked enough questions.
Tom doesn't need to know that.
Some people are intolerant of traveling by sea.
My plane leaves at six o'clock.
I don't know any of the boys.
We're ready to go.
It's a clue.
It's really delicious.
As long as I live, you will not be deprived of anything.
Maria showed us their home.
I heard footsteps, but I didn't see anyone.
Is that our problem?
He gave her one sheet.
My uncle gave his car to me.
I really appreciate that.
Tom put on his helmet.
I've never seen anything like it.
I have an opinion.
I did it myself.
My name is Emily.
Nothing else worked.
I have to get dressed.
I don't think you understand what's important.
I still haven't figured that out.
I need to talk to Tom.
Last night's game was exciting.
Wide jackets are the last scream of fashion.
Don't get lost.
With a little goodwill on both sides, our problems should be able to be resolved.
I don't have much money.
She quickly climbed the stairs.
The house we used to live in is torn down.
I'm getting married next Sunday.
Prices will continue to rise.
We learn French together.
In high school, French was my favorite subject.
Would you call Tom?
No one knows whether he loves her or not.
Get me off this side of the light, please.
I think Tom's hiding from Mary.
Ah, I was sick.
Show it to us.
Why aren't you laughing?
Have you ever said hello to Pfirsichb?
There's been an accident.
I would never hurt them.
I know about this research.
Wouldn't that be nice?
I don't know French, and Greek doesn't really.
He made it clear that he was against the plan.
She can jump high.
Why am I so sleepy?
She answered through tears.
When are you leaving?
Hanako grew up taller than her mother.
This is completely different.
The elephant is grey.
I'm learning French at home.
Don't make so much noise, please.
Have either of you ever seen Tom?
I'll go alone.
He's stronger than you.
I'm dangerous.
Show me that list.
That's all Tom has to do.
Our son is getting married and we want to get our heads straight.
Don't go to that building.
Why isn't Tom in school?
Are you gonna eat that cupcake?
I've been working hard for the last month.
I knew he'd take it.
Don't leave town.
I heard Tom and Mary talking.
We met in London.
Do you have any wine?
This can be a bit of a burden.
Looks like we're running out of water.
Take whatever you like.
I have to tell Tom.
That was very personal.
Do they both understand French?
Something was taken.
Green suits Alice.
Our garbage is collected three times a week.
They trapped the fox.
You're early.
You love kids, don't you?
I felt isolated.
What do you want?
I'm sad.
They were late because of the storm.
I guess it won't be a problem.
Speak slowly, please.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
I'm busy right now.
I feel really bad.
We were soldiers.
Work is not only a necessity, but also a pleasure.
We have to be careful.
It's already eleven.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom over there.
How was your last weekend, Nancy?
Are you studying French?
I'll call you in the morning.
I'm not being unreasonable.
I have to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You should use deodorant.
When I stand up, I get dizzy.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are some things I need to take care of.
I never question his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not going to be a part of this.
You don't seem too surprised.
This is a warning we should take seriously.
What does the fox say?
We'd like to eat. Can you serve us quickly? We should be on the road by half past one.
Let's get some sake.
Tell me a joke.
Tom is practicing to speak French at every opportunity.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
Apples are red.
You have nice hands.
People in general are against war.
Your hair needs a haircut.
I'm better.
Tom has never met me before.
May I see your driver's license?
This will never end.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bugging you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
What tooth hurts?
We're learning French.
What makes you think that?
You're sitting in my seat.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
In school, we learn French every day.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'd be pleasantly surprised.
Tom seems lonely.
Let me tell you something about myself.
I haven't seen Tom since I was thirteen.
Her hobby is collecting postage stamps.
I don't have anything.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were expected to speak more than listen, we would be given two mouths and one ear.
Don't play baseball here.
I got your coat.
We had a great time last night.
I'll drive to Detroit.
You wouldn't believe how popular Tom has become.
Did you do it?
My dad takes me to baseball games a lot.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's girlfriend threatened to leave him.
Are you afraid of something?
Nothing was known of him since he left for America.
Now I'm going to have to deal with it.
I put my hands in my pockets.
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a great musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you heard from your sister recently?
Everyone's hungry.
She went down the stairs.
I was alone, studying.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think you'd better sit down.
Our sales are falling.
I saw Bob this morning.
Bring me something to eat.
If you have not paid due to oversight, please send the amount due and allow us to remedy the problem immediately.
It smells like a toilet in here.
I'm here on vacation.
Looks like you're on your own.
The matter is being considered.
Tom was rescued by a passerby.
The town hall is in the center of the city.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm awfully hungry.
It's very kind of you to go out of your way to help me.
Tom thought Mary's story was interesting.
What do you say we stop the car and take a break?
Tom lives in the same part of town that Mary lives in.
It's a little after eleven past quarter.
Both pronunciations are correct.
I've never seen an eclipse before.
We should call the police.
I have information on Tom.
I'm sure this book has never been translated into French.
I'll see you around.
I'll try it again.
That night, no one could sleep.
The round lasted about five minutes.
He was touring the country.
The sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
Mary can speak Japanese.
I have to call Tom.
It's a little cold today.
I'll sue you.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Who let the dogs in?
I don't feel sick.
I can't even read French, let alone speak it.
I'll do my best.
I'll come with Tom.
Mike swims very well.
Be careful!
I want a boat that will take me far away from here.
Let's talk.
Diamonds are a girl's best friend.
When he was young, his parents died, so his uncle raised him.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
I have to warn him.
Where's the station?
Don't throw anything away.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't bark.
Is it safe?
He sleeps like a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I will follow your instructions.
I have a sharp knife.
You painted the walls, didn't you?
My mother teaches flower arranging.
What a wonderful weather!
Don't waste your youth, or you'll regret it later.
I think you'll find it interesting.
But isn't he above the law?

I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a secluded beach.
Why did Tom want to learn French?
This is where Tom was born.
Where were you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I have no idea how this works.
You're all fools.
They exchange gifts.
Personally, I don't mind.
Mr. Kolkot is starting to like Japanese food.
I put the money in the safe.
We're in a hurry.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You have to emphasize that fact.
This one's okay.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
Tom is teaching me to speak French.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
I think that's very unlikely.

I don't know either boy.
Guests should start coming soon.

It was extremely nice to meet you!
This isn't your house.
I didn't see anything.
Hey, I just got here.
I'm a hero.
Damn you!
Tom pushed Mary off the edge of the cliff.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Prepare for the worst.
Fruits rot under the sun.
He's always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes on the test.
Time is on my side.
Aren't you happy?
It might take a while.
I thought you might reconsider.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Watch out, there's a car coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take him with you.
I just remembered, you shouldn't smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled happily.
He's only four minutes away by train.
What is Tom trying to accomplish?
Can anyone trust you?
It's a little greasy.
I think we'd better go.
Tom said it probably wouldn't take too long.
What's the real reason you don't want to do this?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, come on, be quiet!
I would never hurt them.
I studied French.
Can't you stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you depressed?

Put it back where you got it.
Let's get started.
I screwed you.
Tom discovered that Mary was stealing the cash in the cash register.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it anyway.
Can you do it yourself?
She blushed.
Do you think I'm that stupid?
If you give someone $20 and never see them again, it's probably worth it.
That's Jane's bag.
Tom's always smiling.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary is attractive?
What is the minimum wage in India?
Don't make a decision on this today.
She didn't have much money.
You're sitting in my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
Do you study French?
You don't have to give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What's Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year, we're going to college.
What do you eat, fish or meat?
I made a checking account.
I thought Tom had the day off.

Are you in debt yet?
Will you teach me to speak French?
You're cruel.
Tom remains firm.
The problem seems much more complicated.
I drink water.
Don't worry.
Tom hasn't been well lately.
I have to tell you something first.
One coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have any other choice?

In China we put first the surname and then the name.
Give it to him.

What do you do on the weekend?
Aren't you nervous?

I know you're right.
I need to know what you saw that night.
I studied French for three years with a native speaker.
That's not my car.

His room is a mess.
They devote some of their free time to taking care of the sick.

How complicated is it?
I heard you laughing.
I completely erased it from my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't enter the museum, it's under reconstruction.
He insisted on his own even though I told him not to.
I didn't mean to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom swims very fast.
Add this site to "Favorites".
I have a lot to say about this.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
This concerns you.

You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Have you ever been to the beach with Tom?
I care.
Have you heard Tom speak French?
Beautiful sunset, isn't it?
You really speak French pretty well.
Say hello to Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should choose Tom.
Something's happening.
Do I make myself clear?
Many parents worry that their children are not getting basic knowledge of numbers.
I graduated in philosophy from my university.
Which beach do you like to go to?
You can always give some of the work to junior employees.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very pretty girl.
Tom can't do it.

Is something scaring you?
Everyone agrees with you.

There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.

He didn't get the job.
I think you'll do great.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we have plenty of food.
I'll be on the next bus.
Mary made egg sandwiches.
What did you see?
In the summer I bathe every morning.

Read it again.
I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I didn't get there in time for his speech.
I prefer grapefruits to oranges.
This place is worth visiting at least once.
He continued to read the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just accept it.
Her sister ironed her blouse.
I've told you this before, haven't I?
Why do you keep saying there's plenty of time?
I'll visit you tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or your silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like an orange juice.
From the moment I picked up your book until I dropped it off, I was constantly reeling in laughter, and someday I'm going to start reading it.

You don't have to wait here.
Both Tom and Mary covered their eyes.
That's my baby.
I'll provide you with all the information you need.
Stop whining.
You can't just walk around and speak ill of people.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insured.
I'm borrowing money.
She's getting ready for college.
I think you're really amazing.
It seems all Tom wants is money.
I'm not going with you.

I totally forgot.
She gave me a nice present.
You coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of kings.
I have no intention of apologizing to Tom.
What do you do?
During the vacation, I read all of Milton's works.
What would you recommend?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Each student was asked one question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.

I haven't seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Don't be in a hurry to protect me.
What is the capital of Greece?
Tom can't speak French, Mary can't speak French either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Watch where you're going.
They described the girl as small.
Tom's not used to city life.
You kept your promise.
I forgot about that.
I think you're putting in too much sugar.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll drive you home.
Man is the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden withered.
They made us work all day.
We elected him chairman.

If I hadn't noticed, I'd have told you.
What is the minimum wage in Luxembourg?
His destiny is destined.
Are those candles?
If you had to choose between piano and violin, which would you choose?
The answer is correct.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the exam?
Don't miss the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
So far so good.
This species is endangered.
I think you'd better lie down.

Tom speaks French as well as Mary.
How hungry are you?
This guy's stable.
I almost won.
It wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what happens.
I've seen you with Tom.
Tom is a friend of mine.
You're going about this the wrong way.
Something's happening.
Fill it in.
We have little chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if it's the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it away?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved tangibly relative to what it was.
I tricked you.
His joke was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems facing young people.
We finally met. I've waited a long time for this moment.
Can you elaborate a little bit?
Am I wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary to hold his hand.
I think we should look into it.
So we all agree.
If time permits, I'll go to the museum.
That tie really looks good on you.
I think you'd make a great dad.
There's no way to contact him.
Never give up, never give up.
Could you show me that bag?
This is my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You wouldn't believe me.
Can you come in at nine?
Let's synchronize our clocks.
I shop every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do this.
Is this a duty-free store?
I'm looking for a gift for my friend.
If only I'd told you, kel fida.
This is the camera that Tom took the pictures with.
Don't get lost.
I'm tired of changing my plans every time you decide you want something else.
From a distance, it looks like a person.
We worked hard to make ends meet.
Morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I need to rest.
She said she wouldn't move an inch, no matter who told her what.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The defendant was given the right to appeal.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
My father went fishing.
They offered me nothing to eat.
You don't have to jump to conclusions.
Don't worry about it.
He backed out.
Wine is the milk of adults.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he enters his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I have nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he discovered that Mary had disappeared.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a cab?
I hope I'm not too late.
I came home on the train.
Why are you always so mean?
Alas!
Is that why you didn't want to come with me?
Have you decided what you want to order?
I found the boy fast asleep.
She used to call him whatever.
Are we capable of this?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I had to open my suitcase.
We discussed whether to cancel the reservation.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The swimmers were numb from the cold.
It's allowed for dogs.
Children are the flowers of our lives.
I had to decline the invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be so stupid.
They hated Tom.
Move on.
It's a challenge for me and I'm learning a lot.
Tom was exhausted.
I was counting on her.
Don't look at Tom.
I have to pay for it.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
This is one of the fish that Tom caught.
All right, let's go.
There's a car coming.
Looks like we'll make it in time.

What's the plan, Tom?
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Her condition continued to improve.
Does Tom really want me to go to his party?
I'm not tired at all.
Most people think I'm crazy.
How many museums did you visit?
I waited as long as I could.
He burst into the room without taking off his coat.
Last Saturday I went shopping.
It's June 18th and it's Muriel's birthday.
The way he works shows nothing he can boast of.
We don't see things as they are, but as we are.

I think you're the only one who cares.
What exactly happened to you?

Oxygen is needed for combustion.
Write soon!
I don't know who Tom's wife is.
Be careful!
I don't have to tell you anything.

I've only been there once.
I need you.
I'm glad to know you.
I'm starting to like you.
In America, cars run on the right side of the road.
