Wells Assembly members are worried that they "look like Muppets"
Some of the members of the Assembly were stunned by their proposal to change the title to "CUP" (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was provoked by plans to change the name of the Assembly of the "Parliament of Wales".
Members of the political spectrum are worried that this could be a cause for ridicule.
One Labour said that his band was worried because the new name was "romancing with Dumb and Vdlub."
For Readers outside Wales: In Welsh this certainly has an insulting meaning.
According to one party members, Plaid whole group "is not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party has indicated that his group "is not prejudiced" to the name change, but notes that the new name PMI (in English – MWP) has a certain verbal resemblance to "mute".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced like the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
By the Assembly Commission, which currently drafts the draft bill by which to change the name, made the following statement: "Of course, the final decision for all descriptive names with which members of the Assembly are called will belong to the members themselves."
The Wales Government Act of 2017 gave the Wells Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, establishing broad support for the Assembly to begin to be called the "Parliament of Wales".
As for the position of its members, the Commission prefers "members of Parliament of Wales, briefly "CPU", but the HRP variant has received the greatest support after consulting the public.
Assembly members offer alternative options, but reaching consensus will clearly be a headache for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to pass the bill's draft of change within a few weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules to disqualify its members, as well as the design of the commissary system itself.
The members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what will be called when they reach a debate on the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their state
On Sunday, voters will vote whether to change the name of their state to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is an administrative area named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on changing the name of the state, has ruled that he will not take the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change in the name of the state is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are silenced amid the difficulties of Harlem churches
"If we look at a historical plan, according to the old people I talked to, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today both have disappeared".
Adams says the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in different ways," he added.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms where everyone gathers regularly".
As for the churches, he voiced concern that the money from the sale of the assets would not last as long as the heads expected, "and sooner or later they would be in the same situation."
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks with apartments where people live who do not help to survive the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people buying housing in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the closing process of these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers will visit them".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black neighborhood – the Metropolitan community in 1870, and St Martin's decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation had failed in the years since 1930.
The building then became the possession of the black residents of the neighborhood.
St Martin's was taken over by black Christians under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which was Harlem's main market street, as they did not want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building suffered severe damage in a fire, but Father Johnson's parishioners compiled a plan for its restoration, in which they ordered the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor of St Martin's, proudly called them the "poor bells".
The expert, who used the bells in July, has another description: "Cultur treasure" and "an unreplaceable historical instrument".
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that it was the first system bells in the world that was used by a black musician – Dionycio A. Lind, who had transferred to the larger system at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather mentioned that St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has been played at St. Martin's in the last few weeks has been a complicated tale woven by architects and performers, some brought by secular church leaders, and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
From vestiary – which is the governing body of the congregation consisting of secular leaders – they wrote to the diocese in July, expressing their concerns that the diocese "would be willing to pass on the expenses to vestitory", although he had no role in hiring architects and performers sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old child was injured by a shark in a lobster hunt in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while it was diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, representative authorities reported.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hummel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he overheard the boy screaming for help and embarked along with an entire group to pull him out of the water.
Hummel first thought that the child had caught lobster and got excited, then realized how he was yelling "He bit me!
He bit me!
Hummel says that when he got to the boy, he realized that the entire area of his clavicle had been torn apart.
"I called everyone to get out of the water because there is a shark!", Hummel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Raddie Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It is not yet known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Rescue Captain Larry Gills had pronounced a media briefing that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier in the water, but it was estimated not to be of a dangerous species.
Jills adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Of the responsible authorities, they have closed access to the coastline from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Suomi in Encitinas for 48 hours for safety reasons while the investigation is under way.
Gils notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, however, most of which do not pose danger to humans.
Sainsbury plans an offensive on the UK beauty market
Sainsbury confronts Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by opening beauty stands at its sites where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the UK beauty market, which is estimated at £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while while sales of fashion and household products decrease, the largest so far beauty shops will be located in 11 stores across the country, after which, if the initiative succeeds, such will be found in more sites.
The investment turn in the beauty industry is made at a time when supermarkets look for ways to use the released space on the racks, formerly occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and other home appliances.
Sainsbury has said they will double the number of products offered to over 3,000 products, first including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Current productgrams from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space, similar to the proposals in Boots' stores.
The supermarket also re-releases its boutique range of make-up so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought by younger users.
In addition, perfume trader Fragrance Shop will test discount programs in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, southern London last week, while the second will be opened in Seli Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and shifting focus on shopping smaller amounts of food daily at convenient times leads to supermarkets having to make more effort to attract buyers.
Mike Cope, chief executive of Sainsbury, has said that the sites will look more and more like department stores, while the supermarket chain tries to fight the Aldi and Lidl discounters, offering more services and non-food goods.
From Sainsbury they have Argos sites in hundreds of stores, also opening Habitats sites since they bought both chains two years ago – for which the company claimed to have raised grocery sales and made acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to redesign its sites for beauty and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury made a joint experience with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's outlets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 Celesio sites, which owned the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there, they claim that Lloyds will have a role in the plan by providing a wide range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, commercial director of Sainsbury, made the following statement: "We have transformed the appearance and character of our beauty stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We have also invested in special training for our colleagues, who will offer professional on-the-spot advice.
The range of brands offered by us aims to meet every taste and all needed in a fascinating setting with convenient location, this combination making us an attractive destination for beauty products, which challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "heavy" after Holly Willoughby's refusal of a £11 million deal
Dragons star Peter Jones "was pissed off" after television host Holly Willoughby gave up a £11 million deal with his lifestyle company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for the brand home appliances and accessories Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Poltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of "This Morning" has announced her leaving at Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones "to boil" after withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand business – at the same time to focus on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones "was pissed off" when television's "gold girl" admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds, meant there would be no time for his brand of home products and accessories Truly.
The business was likened to Guinnet Poltrow's Goop brand, with rumours being that it doubled Willoughby's wealth, whose value is predicted at £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram his departure to Truley, Jones left Britain by plane to head to one of his holiday properties.
One of the sources said this: "Truly was definitely Holly's highest priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to ensure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave is absolutely unprepared.
No one believed this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
At the Marlowe headquarters, there is a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold".
Experts believe that the withdrawal of "This Morning", which is one of Britain's most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to the large investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household products, and may also lead to delays in placing the brand on the market.
And last but not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who was her mother of three children, along with her husband Dan Baldwin was a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby herself had founded Truly along with Cap in 2016, with Jones, who was 52, having joined as chairman of the company in March.
The two families often take vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby would become "a messenger" of the brand for M&S and would also replace Ann McParlin as host of the show "I'm a celebrity" on ITV.
A source close to Jones last night made the following statement: "We will not comment on his business affairs".
Severe Negotiations Leading to "House Warming Relationships"
He joked about the criticisms he would have endured from news channels about making a comment that someone would consider "bad for the president" and as too positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in his joking "news" way.
"I haven't given up anything".
He noted that Kim took an interest in a second meeting after the first was held in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump as "a major step towards eliminating North Korea's nuclear weaponry".
But the negotiations to remove this weapon are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea top diplomat Ri Jung Ho told UN General Assembly officials that North Korea "does not see reciprocal treatment" from the United States to its country's first steps along the way of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relationship with North Korea is wonderful," he noted.
"We were heading for war with this country.
Millions of people would have died.
Instead, we now enjoy a wonderful relationship".
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results -- termination of missile tests, release of hostages and return home to the bodies of American servicemen.
He also defended his unorthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It is extremely easy to act as president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded area, we would have about 200 people right there," Trump said, pointing the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island and led to the death of hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombock, foreign non-governmental organizations were declared that they did not need them.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombock were forced to leave their homes, a national disaster was not announced, which is a requirement to initiate international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, an unequivocal opinion is expressed that international assistance is not required, making things slightly challenging," Mrs Sumbung said.
While "Save the Children" compiled a team to head to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the country's territory.
The national spokesperson for the Disaster Agency, Mr Sutopo, announced that Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the reconstruction efforts.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains as unprepared for this kind of natural disasters.
Although shelters were built in Acheh in the event of a tsunami, they are not a common view on the other shores.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the numerous Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate even more this logistics.
Until recently stationed in Lombok for service to the victims of the earthquake a hospital ship headed for Palu, but it will be at least three days before he can reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo turned the improvement of Indonesia's backward infrastructure into the center of his election campaign by investing a large amount of money in roads and railways.
But insufficient finances constantly harassed his cabinet, while Jocko again headed the polls the following year.
Mr. Jocko is also under pressure caused by continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands forced to leave their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with mats, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturidge brought a late draw for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sturge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a 89th minute goal this Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturidge received a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27-28 metres from Chelsea's door while his team was behind 1-0.
He set the ball on his left leg, then fired a precise shot to the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penalty field and headed to the top right corner of the net.
She transferred the plentiful Kepa Arisabalega and became unsavory in the net.
"I tried to take a good position to master the ball because players like Shak are always looking for pitches in front positions, so I just tried to earn as much time as possible for a good shot to the door," Sturge told Liverpool.com.
"I saw the coming Kante, pushed my ball and just fired without much to think about".
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute after a goal of his Belgian star Eden Azar.
The "blue" attacker passed with a fifth to Mateo Kovacic, then sprinted from the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
Kovacic traded a quick double pass downtown.
He then released a quick gunshot pass with which he took Azar to a clean position in the criminal field.
Azar outrun the defenders and scored with his left foot in the far corner past Liverpool's goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 15:00 this Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths since the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, as reported by the country's Disaster Agency early Sunday.
Multiple people were trapped among the ruins of buildings collapsed after the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, which struck the country on Friday and led to waves up to 20 feet high, news conference spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugrojo reported at the news conference.
The town of Palu with over 380 000 people is littered with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man 32 on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation was launched after this morning in Berkenhead, Mercyside was discovered the body of a woman.
The remains of the 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds to Grayson Mose on John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of the murder.
The police are asking for assistance from everyone in the district who has seen or heard nothing.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan made the following statement: "The investigation is still at an early stage, but I'm begging everyone who was near John Street in Berkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with their backgammon cameras, to contact us, as they may have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Berkenhead and that she was found on private property.
This afternoon, a group of friends who consider the woman to be their acquaintance arrived at the scene asking where she was found the morning.
The investigation continues, with police reporting that he is currently informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives on Grayson Mose attempted to return to his apartment, but was informed by police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
The man was speechless when he found out about what happened.
Residents have been told it will be hours until they are allowed to go home.
One of the police officers reported to a man that the entire area was treated as a crime scene.
There was a crying woman on the scene.
She keeps saying "it's so horrible".
At 2 p.m., two police vans passed through the cordon while another van stayed outside.
Police officers are stationed in the cordon watching the apartment block.
All available information are pleaded to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestopters anonymously on 0800 555 111, code 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue became the newest memorial hit by "rewriting history"
Her ban would be poetic justice for his almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts, which was carried out by his fanatic puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr Crick's proposal as "insane" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, the chairman of Cromwell's Society, said this: "It was inevitable in the current debate to remove statues that Oliver Cromwell's until Westminster Palace became a goal.
The icony of the English Civil Wars was neither commissioned nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be turned into a victim due to the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent performance by Sir William Hamo Tornicroft was evidence of opinion in the 19th century and part of historiography as a figure that many still considered worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph the following: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, of course in his case this was the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is subject to continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the mid-17th century that shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable person who represents one side of the division that has occurred.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve prominence and celebration."
Pig-killer wounds a deadly Chinese farmer
Farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man identified only by his surname as Yuan was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a mess in the Lipanswi market in Guizhou Province, reported Sunday South China Morning Post.
The pig farmer prepared to inject his pigs with vaccines in May 30, 2005 in Sinin from Qinhai Province, China.
He is believed to have arrived with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also found the door to the next mess open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig in the stall with a bloody snout.
Forensics has confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked the farmer fatally, the report reports.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," said cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager has reported to Evening News that the pig was locked up so he can't attack anyone else while police are collecting evidence from the crime scene.
It has also been reported that Yuan's family and market leadership are negotiating for compensation for the death.
Although rare, pigs that attack people have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, as after the attack the man was with critical injuries.
Ten years before that, 650-pound pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor while his wife managed to drive him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer had told CBC News that pigs were usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood could affect them as "a trigger".
"They're just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... they're not meant to hurt anyone.
But one should also treat them with respect," the man ends.
The weakening hurricane Rosa will lead to frequent and heavy rains in the southwestern United States
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as she moves over the cool waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the following days, Rosa will lead to flooding rains in northern Mexico and southwestern United States.
Rosa includes winds with a force of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane starting at 5 o'clock Sunday morning east time and is 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
During this time, over the Pacific Ocean, a sinclinal begins to form, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baha California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture deep northward to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will lead to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching sinclin will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, suffered debris streams and likely landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to rainfall from 2 to 3 inches an hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected, especially over most of Arizona.
There may be lightning flooding in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to travel a handful in the desert when a threat of tropical rains lies ahead.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to raised dust and violent winds.
The approaching sinclin will lead to heavy rains in some parts along the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach rainfall of over half an inch, which will lead to small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the rainy season.
In late Sunday and early Monday scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger area on late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
October may bring large temperature fluctuations to the United States as the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There is nearly 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moine, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to increase and expand.
In most of the central and eastern United States, it is expected to have a warm start in October, with temperatures around 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast expected to prevail.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the fascinating spectacle of Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh's testimony and Christine Blacy Ford - the woman who accused him of sexual assault that took place in the 1980s.
During this time, political opposition continued, with networks interrupting their regular turnaround programs in the last minutes of Friday: an agreement that was arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake and according to which the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that she was 100% convinced Cavanaugh was making out with her drunk and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Cavanaugh, in his emotionless testimony, is absolutely clear that such a thing has not happened.
It is likely that even more of the number reported by Nielsen of 20.4 million viewers saw the certificate on Friday.
The company has counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no direct data available on the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also Nielsen traditionally has difficulty measuring the number of people who look from their jobs.
For comparison, we are talking about an audience similar in size to that of a championship football game or Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leading strongly supported Cavanaugh's appointment, was first among all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-time hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to what Nielsen CBS reported, it had 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a declaration that he would vote in favour of Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras filmed him being booed by protesters on Friday while trying to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judicial Commission.
During all the harassment for a few minutes he never lifted his eyes off the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here, standing before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he presents the truth to the state?
"You have power while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Flake responded that his office had already issued a declaration and before the elevator doors closed, he announced that he would make an additional ruling during the hearing by the committee.
Cable and broadcasting networks provided a tight live coverage a few hours later when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer Cavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate's attention for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do this if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominee next week, which Democrats insist on in opposition.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Party Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several Senators Fleck made a decision.
His choice was definitely essential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political playoffs" with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "political play" with Britain's future and of undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published next to this with her on the front page of the newspaper, her previous Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called Lady's Play Plan for Brexit, saying that collecting customs fees from Britain to the EU and vice versa was "totally absurd".
Wade Simms' shooting: Police arrested suspect Ditian Simpson for the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect for the final fatal shooting on Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Ditian Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, Baton Rouge police department reported.
Officials presented a video of Simms-Simpson confrontation, with police reporting Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson's DNA on them, reported from CBS WAFB affiliate.
Following Simpson's interrogation, police reported that he confessed to the fatal shot against Wade.
His bail was set at $350,000, notified by Advocate.
East Baton Rouge's forensics office released a preliminary report Friday, indicating a gunshot wound that affected the head and neck as the cause of death.
The department expressed their gratitude to the Luizian State Police's fugitives search department, police crime lab, Southern University police and locals for the assistance they provided in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
LSU athletic sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for "temporary justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6 feet and 6 inches high player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
On average in the last season he achieved 5.6 points and 2.6 ricochets per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade reported that the team was "stricken" and "in shock" after Wade's death.
Wade has said that "this is something that worries a person all the time".
Volcano spreads ashes over Mexico City
Popotepetel's ash ejected from the volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre had warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater had risen and 183 gas and ash discharges were recorded in the last 24 hours.
The center has observed numerous tremors and tremors.
Photographs published on social networks show a thin layer of dust that covers the windshields of cars in some of the neighborhoods of Mexico City, for example in Hokimilko.
Geophysicals have noted an increase in the volcano's activity, which is 45 miles (72 kilometres) south-east of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police in a clash with Catalan separatists in front of the independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the gendarmerie when thousands joined opposing demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing vote to segregate Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not admitted by the gendarmerie, began throwing at peacekeepers with eggs and dust paint, thus creating dark and dust clouds on the streets, which are usually swarming with tourists.
Later in the day, other skirmishes with the police arose, with the police resorting to their batons to master the situation.
For hours supporting independence, groups shouted "We don't forget, we don't forgive", while the country's advocates returned with "Spain forever".
The local press reported that as a result of the protests fourteen people received medical assistance for minor injuries.
The tension remained high in the desired independence region even a year after the referendum held on 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist-oriented Catalans.
The huge majority voted in favour of independence, although activity was low, as most opponents of the secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote from taking place in the polls in the region with a number of violent clashes.
Requesting independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place but was forced to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer holds hope for Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be in a standstill," the man added.
Despite the marked important victory, be it with little difference, in the regional elections in the last December, supporting Catalonia political parties' independence are experiencing difficulties this year, as many of their most famous leaders are either in self-imposed exile or are arrested in anticipation of a trial because of their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his phone a protest to support the police, claimed the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
His comment is that "it's getting more intense."
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of nine arrested Catalan leader in anticipation of a preliminary trial last year, announced he would run in the European Parliament election next year.
He argues that "my candidacy for European elections is the best way to oppose the regression of democratic values and the repression we are seeing by the Spanish government".
Londonderry: Arrested men after a car crashed into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39, respectively, were arrested after a car had several times been stuck in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard Crescent Thursday around 7:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings has announced that there has been damage to both the gate and the building itself.
It is also possible that a crossbow was fired at the car.
Menga goal brings Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Premier League rookie Livingston surprised Rangers and only lost Stephen Gerard in his first 18 games as Ibrox club manager.
Dolly Menga's goal proved decisive, and Gary Holt's team tied to points with the second in the Hibernion standings.
Gerard's team went undefeated on a foreign field in the Premier League this season, and the following Sunday faced leader Harts, from which he trailed eight points in the rankings.
But previously, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has already been in a series of six games without a loss in the championship, and manager Holt has not yet tasted the taste of loss since he changed to Kenny Miller's post last month.
Livingston missed good opportunities against the visionless guests
Holt's team had to lead in the score away before scoring a goal, and his direct play style extremely difficult Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his hit went sideways, then Alan Litgow fired past the beam after Craig Halket returned the ball head to him.
The hosts let the Rangers play the ball, knowing that they could seriously make it difficult for guests from static situations.
And that's how it got to the winning goal.
The Rangers committed a violation, and Livingston played well, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined each other and took Menga, who led his ball and scored from the middle of the penalty field.
Up until now, the Rangers had more control over the ball, but faced the impenetrable protection of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This style of play continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
The Rangers' goalkeeper saved Scott Pittman's foot, and a blow with Litlow's head passed past the door after another static position for Livingston.
In Livingston's penalty field, the centered one fell, which, however, was easily cleared, and the judge twice respected the guest's claims for a penalty – first after a single fight between Halket and Glen Middleton Reserve, and then in case of doubts of handplay.
"Fenomental" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland on "Tony Macaroni Arena"
A phenomenal game and a great score for Livingston.
The team game simply superb, continuing to surpass expectations and improve its performance.
The style of play and the composition almost suffered no changes after the team's return to the Premier League, but Holt deserved much praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the field.
Captain Halket was amazing, organizing the defense in an excellent way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell under pressure.
At the same time, the Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, they demonstrated some great things, but in this case they were far below those standards.
They missed the last pass before the goal, and only once managed to split the defense of the hosts – this loss should wake the Rangers, who are currently located in the middle of the rankings.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) we saw smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to correct the relationship between NATO allies.
A friendly relationship has cooled due to human rights issues, media freedom and Turkey's EU admission.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, police prevented a 25-thousand crowd from gathering outside the mosque, yet many supporters who wanted to see their president gathered around.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom Kurds, also rose to voice, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to allow it into the country.
Various protests reflect the rift caused by one visitor, which is considered a hero by some German Turks and is, at the same time, despised as a despot by others.
Road crash in Deptford: A cyclist rests after a car collision
A cyclist died after a car collision in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, around 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and medical assistance arrived, yet the cyclist died instantly.
The crash occurred several months after another cyclist died after being hit by an escaped Childers Street driver located near a mile from the site of the Saturday crash.
The police have announced that her employees are working to identify the man, then notify his relatives.
The road is closed and bus lines are diverted, and it is also recommended that motorists avoid the area.
Long Lartine Prison: Six wardens injured in mutiny
Six prison guards were injured in a riot in the high-security men's prison, the Prison Service reported.
The mutiny broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcester at nearly 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and still continues.
In order to overcome it, special officials from the Tordano unit were called upon to deal with eight prisoners of liberty, with the mutiny itself in a confined to one wing of the prison.
The injured guards suffered minor injuries to the faces and received medical attention on site.
A spokesman for the Prison Service made the following statement: "Specially trained officials have been called to deal with the incident that occurred at Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards have received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we very clearly state that the responsible persons will be handed over to the police, with their sentences being extended".
Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after an attack on a prisoner, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, police officers from riot fighting units were called to prison to master a heavy mutiny in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens with lightning flooding Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although dried areas may benefit)
It is rare that Arizona is hit by a tropical storm, but there is a good chance that this will happen early next week, while weakening hurricane Rosa floats through the desert to the southwest, taking a risk of lightning flooding with her.
The National Weather Service has already established posts against lightning flooding in Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different path over Finisk on Tuesday, with rain coming in late Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted on Twitter that "since 1950 so far only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border".
Recent models from the National Hurricane Center envisioned 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in Mugolo Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest wilderness, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of rain possible in separate locations.
For those not threatened by lightning floods, Rosa's rain may actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, some of the rain is likely to be useful, as the southwest part is currently on land.
According to the U.S. Dry Period Monitoring Commission, just over 40% of Arizona suffer from at least excessive drought, which is the second most heavy category," Weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to land reaching the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who on Sunday morning can still boast at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets cooler waters over the Pacific and therefore weakens.
It is therefore expected to reach land at Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain over a part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of excesses.
"Multiple rains are expected from up to 6 inches from Baha California to northwest Sonora, possible up to 10 inches," Weather.com reported.
Rosa would then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border Tuesday early in the morning as a tropical depression, which would then pass through Arizona into southern Utah by Tuesday late evening.
"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely heavy rain in Baha California, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center warned.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening lightning floods and carrying various waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountain terrain.
Assault in Midsamer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old child was found with stabbing wounds in Summerset.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsummer Norton around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
It was placed in a hospital where its condition remained "stable".
On the night in the Radstock district, a 17-year-old boy, two boys 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man, reported by the Avon and Summerset police.
The police are asking everyone who may have filmed what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered from the insolence and anger" of the democratic party
"Every vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a voice that rejects the treacherous and outrageous tactics of the democratic party," Trump announced at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Cavanaugh had "felled from the insolence and anger" of the democratic party during its nomination.
Cavanaugh testified to Congress Thursday, categorically dismissing Christine Blacy Ford's charge of sexual assault decades ago at the time the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the prosecution's hearing.
The president made a statement Saturday that "today, the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence, courage and qualities."
"Every vote in favour of Judge Cavanaugh is a vote in favour of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation in public service," the president told the crowd of Western Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Cavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican votes for the general election.
"There are five weeks left to some of the most important elections in our time.
Although I am not a candidate, in fact I am also involved," Trump continued.
"It's why I'm going around and fighting to support good applications".
Trump noted that Democrats had set themselves on a mission "to prevent and hinder".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for Cavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, as CNN reported one of the collaborators of a senior Republican party representative.
Hundreds died after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, casualties increased
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were swept away by sweeps of the coast giant waves when a severe earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities announced on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when at nightfall the coast was swept by waves up to six metres (18 ft), carried many to their death and destroyed everything in their path.
Tsunami struck after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately, therefore many were victims of the disaster," announced during a briefing in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, Indonesia's Disaster Prevention Agency spokesman BNPB.
"Water had dragged with it cars, trees, whole houses, hit everything on its way," Nugroho continued and added that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the shore.
"Some people climbed the trees and thus managed to save themselves from the water," he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Published by the Disaster Agency photographs from the air showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, demolished and twisted bridges, as well as a water-covered mosque.
Secondary tremors continued to swing the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) issued a declaration that the energy released from the Friday massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographic location of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugrojo described the damage as "huge" and specified that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, the spokesman added, then added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be higher along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area that is called Donggala, which is located closer to the epicenter of the quake.
He also added that "communications are completely crossed and there is no information from Donggala".
The Red Cross, in turn, indicated that there are more than 300,000 people living there, adding that its teams and volunteers are already heading for the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it may be even harder".
On Saturday, the agency was furiously criticized for not informing about the striking Palu tsunami, although officials explained that the waves had arrived during a announcement.
Shared in social networks amateur videos show a man upstairs of a building who yells at people on the street panic warnings about the approaching tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall crashes into the shore and carries both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the authenticity of the video in time.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a severe power outage, which stopped communications around Palu, and thus made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the responsible authorities reported, but evacuated still desperately needed food and other primary products.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
Those who died in the Indonesian tsunami are already over 800.
It's extremely bad.
While World Vision officials from Donggala managed to get safely to Palu, where they found shelter in bresnet shelters crucified in the yard of their office, they had passed a number of scenes of devastation, Mr Dosseba said.
"They told me they saw countless destroyed houses".
It's extremely bad.
Despite the work started on rescue and reconstruction emergency groups, some complain that those with extensive experience in such situations foreign rescuers are prevented from getting to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, sending staff and supplies from abroad can only be started if the striking place is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The disaster is still at regional level," said Aula Ariani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government has announced that it is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but hence have not yet declared such status".
While the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who are still missing continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones have somehow survived the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subando, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped in the Roa-Roa Hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi added.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours after the news of the Roa-Roa hotel collapse reached the Paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to the Palu contestants who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue bookmarks, however, the only response to his messages was a single gray one.
"I think that means the messages are not delivered," he added.
Thieves steal $26, 750 during loading an ATM at Levi's Newport.
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,50 from a Brink employee who was loading an ATM at Levy's Newport, it became clear from a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM at the amusement complex and was preparing to load it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
While the man was busy, another man "had approached running from behind the back of Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses have noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, the announcement continues, but police have not indicated the number involved in the theft.
Anyone who has any information on the identity of the suspects should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of the Twitter change on Saturday, he also wrote: "The man officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been wearing the nickname Ye for some time and has been using it as a title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change preceded his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he was expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He changed singer Ariana Grande on the show, which gave up "for emotional reasons," the show's creator reported.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously claimed that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you' or 'you'," West said earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with radio-leading Big Boy.
"This way I am you, I am us, it is us.
Passed by Kanye, which means only one person, just to Ye—which is a reflection of the good in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our essence".
The rapper is one of many known in its sphere, who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and names, including Puff Dadi, P Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for nicknames Leo and Brother Leo.
One of West's previous associates, Jay Z, has also presented himself in a variant with or without a dash and/or capital letters in his nickname.
The president of Mexico vows not to use the army against civilians.
The newly elected Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador swore he would never use military force as the country nears the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelenko Plaza, President Lopez Obrador promised "never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
Soldiers fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people, while student movements with left-wing political views gradually spread among Latin America.
Lopez Obrador took an oath to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening more free public universities.
The President also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attracts youths to criminal gangs.
U.S. has to double the financing of II development
At a time when China became increasingly active on the front of developing artificial intelligence, the United States had to double its research budget in this area, the II researcher and developer Kai-Foo Loi, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various units of the U.S. government made speeches on the subject of the II, although the United States as a whole did not have an official strategy for the II.
During this time, China presented its plan as early as last year: the country sought to become number 1 on innovation in the II by 2030.
"Doubling the budget to develop the II will be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the United States and are about to make further breakthroughs regarding the II," Lee claimed.
Double funding may also double the chances that the next major achievement in the II field will come from the United States, as Lee informs CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book "III's Supersilients: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest companies for II in China - Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon Lee University worked on an AI system that defeated America's most successful Othello player, then was CEO at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee attributed what was due to previous technology competitions to the federal government, for example the robotics competition of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next one would be to help identify the new visionaries.
"Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to gain government funding," Lee said.
"It's not China that takes away academic executives but corporations," the man said.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university lights to work on II.
Lee also claimed that changes in immigration policy could help the United States strengthen its II program.
"I think I should automatically offer the doctors on EI sciences green cards," the man said.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Foundation for Natural Science provides funding for people from academic institutions like the way the National Science Foundation and other state organizations fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee specified.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center on Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA reported an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in the development of the II.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, who wanted to set up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not noted any activity in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum whether to change the name of their state
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum this Sunday whether the name of the state should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia. This is a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area with the name Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim against its territorial integrity, which is why it vetoes its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov said that he himself would not vote in the referendum, while a campaign for boycotting him casts a shadow of doubt whether the referendum would be able to reach the minimum 50 percent required to recognise its validity.
The issue of ballots reads: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, which include Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the Yugoslavia-based state of Macedonia into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to give my voice for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough Members of Parliament have ruled that they will comply with the outcome of it to such an extent that the vote already has a decisive burden.
In order to change the name of the state, two thirds of parliamentary representatives must vote for it.
The state election commission announced that there were no reports of irregularities until 1 afternoon.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters visited the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen of the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will open the way for joining NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kawadarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and arranged chairs in front of tents stretched by boycotting the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads up proudly, not through the wicket for servants," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead to the investments needed for Macedonia, as unemployment in the state is over 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as over 80 percent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he cast his own vote.
The statesman also said that the positive result would lead to "confirming the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies published survey results saying that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum -- which is less than necessary activity.
Another poll by Macedonian TV Thelma announced that 57% of respondents are planning to vote Sunday.
Of them, 70% have said they will vote "Yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum is unsuccessful, this will be the first serious blow against pro-Western government policy since it won power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through Brighton's entire defense and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Ethidad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's play for his goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when Argentine scorer was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He outrun three Brighton defenders before sprinting the ball into the empty space forward.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He snuck past one of the defenders, then left the rest behind on Brighton's criminal field.
Then he passed left to Sterling.
The English striker with one touch brought the ball back to Aguero, who with a right-legged blow overcame Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his door.
"Aguero fights some injuries at his feet," City Pep Guardiola's manager told reporters.
"We planned for him to play for about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky you scored a goal at that exact moment".
But Sterling was the one who provided the original advance to the "heaviest blues" in this England Premier League match.
He signed in 29 minutes.
In the naked situation, Aguero received a pitch deep into half of Brighton.
He immediately dropped a forward pass on the left flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sanne advanced with the ball, then found Stirling with a pass on the far beam.
The attacker of "the sky blues" managed to detect closely, shortly before the ball came out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a 1255 Champions League group stage game Tuesday afternoon at Rain Nekar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play determined fate of Rockies
Since the Nationals did not qualify for the playoffs, there is little point for another starting pitcher game.
Yet the always ambitious Sherzer hopes to be the starting Sunday against Colorado Rockies, if the match is relevant to the Rockies, who lead with one game in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West rankings.
Rockies guaranteed at least participation in the Wild Card match after a 5-2 win against Nationals on Friday night, but it is still not certain they will win their first division title.
"Although we ourselves are not fighting for anything, we want to finish the season with a good match in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win perhaps the most important match for them during the year.
Why would I want to miss such a game?"
Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but they are supposed to allow Sherzer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Sherzer, this would be the 34th game as starting pitcher this year, with him holding a Thursday practice and having normal rest time by Sunday.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump recruits supporters in West Virginia
President Kosco hinted about the situation with his Supreme Court elected Brett Cavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republican votes in the general election.
"In November, everything we have achieved will be at risk.
Five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the biggest moments in current history – I also state that although I am not a candidate, I am also actually involved, which is why I am fighting with all the forces for the right applications," Trump said.
Then go on with "You all see this scary, terrifying radical group of Democrats, you see them with your eyes.
They are determined to regain power in any way, you yourselves witness their ruthlessness, their malice.
They don't care when they can hurt, who they have to run over to cling to power and rule, because they only care about power and government, but we won't give them to them".
Democrats, according to the president's words, have set themselves to "obstruct and hinder".
"What we've all seen in the last four days," he continued, calling Democrats "angry, nasty, mean and unfaithful".
The president reminded of the Senate Judicial Commission, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which caused strong boogers from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the document?
I'm sorry, what?
No, no, I was waiting – that was a really bad gesture – maybe the worst I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer open-minded.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I am just the last Member of Parliament for now from Labour, who was said not to be welcome – just because I speak frankly.
My colleague in Parliament Joan Ryan received similar treatment as she decisively faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship criticized me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironicly similar to those with which Jeremy disagreed at the time of previous leaders.
The notice of the meeting of Labour by Nottingham East on Friday said that "we wish the meetings to include everyone and be beneficial".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, Friday's meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and promises of a "lighter and measured" policy have long been forgotten if they were ever on the agenda.
It became increasingly apparent that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion was judged on the basis of how much the party's leadership liked it.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I worked for before considered to share similar political views began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions I would never agree with – whether in national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I make public statements—no matter what I actually say—there follows a whole insulting tyrate in social networks, where it is called for recall, rejection of moderate politics, applications that I do not belong to Labour.
Like this doesn't just happen to me.
As a matter of fact, I know that I even got more lucky than some of my colleagues, since the comments about me are, at least, mostly of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purpose of those colleagues who face sexist or racist flips every day without being afraid of them.
One of the greatest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer widely defined, with any sign of distrust or change of the rules of choice becoming increasingly narrow-minded.
Over the past two years, I have received numerous advices to calm down, not to talk so much, and that "everything will be fine."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student provoked by the Government of Thatcher, which through my neglect led to a literal breakdown of my excellent school, I fought for better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local or minister.
I never hid my political views, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way in my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state heads for Brexit, it will harm households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the Labour chief.
But my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: It is my pride to serve you and I promise that no threats of recall or political excommunication will refuse me to act in the way I consider best in protecting your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Undefeated Air led in the rankings
The two late essays may have changed a slight final score, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Tennent Premier League game.
The Tim has already topped the rankings and the only one of the ten teams has been without loss so far.
The better defense and better use of opportunities proved crucial in the match, by which coach Peter Murchi and his team could be very satisfied.
"I am happy because the other teams tested us quite seriously in the past matches, and we are still without loss," Murchi noted.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Congratulations to Air really took advantage of their situations better than us."
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional strike by Frazier Climo, brought Air forward in the score, but a yellow card for the Scottish National Rory Hughes, released to play in the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to catch up in the score after Jason Baggot carried out an essay followed by a failed complementary blow.
Klimo increased the lead for Air from a penalty kick shortly before halftime, scoring an essay after a solo action, and then realizing the additional blow, making the score 17-5 for Air on the break.
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful extra hit by Baggott, reduced the lead to only five points.
A continuous stop of the game followed due to a severe injury to Ruarid Nott, which was carried out on a stretcher, and after the game was renewed, Air increased their advance after a Stafford McDoal essay and a successful extra blow to Climo.
The acting captain of Air Blair McPherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage, exerting strong pressure and carrying out an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by a failed extra blow.
However, the hosts regained the presence of the spirit and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after knocking down Klimo without a ball, from the subsequent criminal play McPherson implemented an essay using Air's advancing offensive line.
Klimo realised the extra shot, and not long after Kyle Rowe caught the kicked ball by David Armstrong and took wingman Gregor Henry on the flank for the fifth essay of the hosts.
The Still Game star seems to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business.
The Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears to have headed for a more direct and warm industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor played Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular show, of which he was also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last for the show, looking like Kieran is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor abstained from comment, although a source from Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was planning to join the "proving restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": the no-showing Bolivia Sea hope that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Sailors are constantly patrolling the tackled sea headquarters in La Paz.
There's an ocean blue flag flying over public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are adorned with the motto: “The sea belongs to us by right.
It's our duty to get it back."
In all Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost outlet passed on to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century, is still alive—as is the call to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
In fact, this hope is currently the strongest in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting judgment from the international court on 1 October after five years have passed in consideration.
"The power is in Bolivia, there is a sense of vigor and unity everywhere, with the country expecting a positive result," Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadila said.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the international court on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's claim and that after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign ocean access.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic local president, who is due to head for a disputed re-election battle the following year, has also put much and much into the judgment of the court on Monday.
"We are close to regaining access to the Pacific," Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the possibility that the court will make a decision in favor of Bolivia is quite small, and even if it decides in its favor, that would not change things in reality.
The UN body located in the Netherlands has no power to take Chile's territory and has ruled that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the international court is only six months after the hearing of the last arguments, points out that the case "is not complicated", responded Paz Zarate, Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may actually have hurt her.
"The problem with access to the ocean was swelled by Bolivia's current government," Zarate said.
He then hinted that Morales's militant rhetoric had cleared up and Chile's few remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after what has happened to have a normal dialogue.
The two countries have not maintained diplomatic missions with each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
According to him, on Monday Bolivia will have "the incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relationship with Chile", as well as a chance to "end 139 years of dissent by achieving benefits for both sides".
Kalzadila also rejected the idea that Morales—who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America—has used the problem of ocean access as a "political crutch".
"Bolivia will never give up its right to exit the Pacific," he added.
"Request is an opportunity to see that we must overcome our past problems".
North Korea claims it will not continue with nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never proceed to nuclear disarmament first unless he is able to trust Washington.
Ri presented his speech Saturday to the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep the promises they made during the meeting between the leaders of opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of relaunching deadlock diplomacy on the nuclear issue more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Yong Un of North Korea.
Ri called "empty hope" the idea that continuing with US sanctions and objections to a declaration to end the Korean War would cause the North to fall on its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture along the way of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second date.
But there is widespread skepticism that in Pyongyang they are serious about their refusal from an arsenal they view as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion reviews in Paris reveal the last scream on massive hats that will soon be in the fashion stores next door
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun's rays, you don't need to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown revealed a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which stunned the fashion podium during Fashion Week in Paris.
Pretty impractical hats caused a wave in Instagram in the summer, with designers sending their eye-catching creations to crush the fashion community.
Valentino's twisting proposal was an extravagant beige hat with a likeness of feathers a wide periphery that literally swallowed the heads of the models.
The other too huge accessories included decorated watermelons, magic hat and even pineapple – but they were not meant to keep warm on your head.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and hinted not so much about high fashion as about Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled diving equipment in a complete set with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted cone of ice cream.
If you're into fashion trends like this, you're lucky.
Fashion specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold at the fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come very soon after "La bomb" – the straw hat with a two-foot periphery that was seen on everyone's heads – from Rihanna to Emily Rataykovski.
The cult of the extremely impractical hat that took over social networks led to the emergence of another huge design of the fashion podium – a straw beach bag, almost as large as the wearer wearing a bathing suit.
The rafe bag with the colour of a burnt orange, with fringes of a raphia and tapered with a handle of white leather, was the attracting all look item in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacques during Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitide told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – after the designer made such an impression, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintained a reputation for academic distinction, continuing this in 2018 with another superb performance of the exam results, which was only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS) sought to offer the best level to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their chosen career and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can compile and implement a personal curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable object in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in an understandable language, your words manage to reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language when we want to build relations and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year's exams, we see that languages come first with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved the high grade A.
The data collected from 74 members of SCIS schools showed that 72% of students achieved an A in Chinese rating, with the same rating having 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of those in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland perceive foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need for the future.
Languages as the subject of free choice by students currently receive the same attitude as natural-mathematic disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) in both programs of independent schools and beyond.
A study conducted in 2014 by the United Kingdom Employment and Employment Skills Commission showed that, from the reasons why employers are making it difficult to find employees, 17% have indicated insufficient linguistic competence.
Therefore, more and more knowledge of foreign languages becomes mandatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require that a foreign language is exercised, which makes these skills essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person masters a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future after wielding such a skill that remains for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the possessor of several languages one breasts before competition.
According to a study by YouGov among more than 4,000 adult UK citizens in 2013, 75% did not have a foreign language well enough to be able to conduct a language, with French being the only language whose proficiency reached a two-digit percentage with an index of 15%.
That is why the investment in language learning today is important to children now.
A number of languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will differ from taught languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important to the United Kingdom in a future plan by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be plenty of languages to choose from in independent schools, with the teachers being specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare the children and give them the necessary skills to succeed in life, regardless of what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to have an incredibly important role for the future of any country that requires this to be taken into account in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his Lakers debut this Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans eager to see LeBron James' first game with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced James would take part in the team's first preseason training match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it is not yet specified how many minutes he will play in the fight.
"It will be on the field between one and 48 minutes," the joking Walton announced through the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell announced in Twitter that James would probably play relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans regarding the six games of Lakers' preseason preparation.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need preseason games to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump began a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia..
This was the first of the five planned Trump rallies to include stops in familiar locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Delaying the confirmatory vote for his election to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aimed to support the upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans were threatened by losing control of Congress when the vote was cast in November.
At what time will the Trump rally take place in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia was scheduled for 7:00 p.m., east time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia, below by broadcasting live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider hearings this week for Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh, in which tension arose over allegations of immoral sexual acts, which retained the Senate's confirmation vote up to a week while an FBI investigation was under way.
However, the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November election.
Therefore, in President Donald Trump's campaign, it was announced that these five rallies next week aimed "anactivisation of volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Congressional control is so essential to his program that the president will visit as many states as possible and we begin a campaign season filled with commitments," Reuters told a spokesman for the Trump campaign who refuses to be mentioned.
Tonight's rally, scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Weeling, could bring in supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump's second visit for this month will take place in West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to give him a boost in polls," said Simon Heather, a political scientist from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team will fight to the last, keeping their hopes alive before Sunday's singles
After three consecutive sessions without intrigue "foursom" matches on Sunday afternoon perhaps brought what Ryder Cup needed.
The shift of advantage in sport is a quite subjective concept, in which, however, players believe unreservedly, even more in contests such as this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They led by six points, and now there are only four, so I guess we've picked up a little momentum," Jordan Spite said at the end of today's race day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage with only twelve more for allocation.
As Spite says, however, Americans have more to show and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge by the sports form of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together throughout the day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Speed shows excellent shape from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the real leader of his team.
The fans' encouraging cheers became stronger as he progressed in the round in which with a precise strike he tied the score in the fourth game after along with Thomas behind by two strokes after the first two holes.
His blow, which won them the game of the 15th hole, was met with strong enthusiastic reactions that make us believe that really not everything was lost to the American team.
"The important thing is not to think about anything else and focus on your own match," said Spite.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Spite and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flatwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup characters so far.
The strange but delightful couple from Europe, won four out of four, and it seems to be all working out for them.
"Mollywood" were the only couple who did not do "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they also did not have "godit" either on Saturday morning or Friday afternoon or in the morning.
These successive successes, as well as the way that it seemed to pass energy between them and enthusiastic fans, strengthened the view that they were the players who would win on Sunday and there would be no better pair than Flitwood and Molinari, which would bring Europe's potential victory while the sun set over "Le Golf National".
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The stories of European glory, however, proved a little premature.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the "fourball" character matches from the morning while he partnered with Alex Norren.
"Gods" and two "dibles" of the first nine holes put the Spaniard and Swede into problems they couldn't handle.
In Sunday games, however, no one else can solve your problems.
"Fourball" and "foursome" matches are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they exchange each other, and the way a strategy can undergo changes at any time.
Europeans played better teamwork and therefore gained a significant lead before the last day, but this session of "foursom" matches showed that the American team was also ready to fight to the last – something many people, especially in the United States, strongly doubted.
Europe led by 10–6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid lead before Ryder Cup's last day after leading the United States 10–6 after playing the games from the "fourball" and "foursome" formats on Saturday.
The inspiring duet Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari began with two victories against the inconclusive Tiger Woods, with which their asset at the Le Golf National race rose to four points.
In an attempt to reclaim the trophy he lost to "Hazeltine" two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated the morning's "fourball" matches over Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and eventually Europe won the series with 3–1 wins.
The United States had more resistance in the "foursome" matches where they won two wins, but failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furrick's team needs 8 points from the 12 single games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Flitwood was the first rookie from Europe to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known for the nickname "Mollywood", after this sensational weekend became only the second couple to win four points out of their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After unopposed outplaying Woods and Patrick Reed in the "fourball" matches, they were extremely motivated to defeat the Woods faulty and American rookie Bryson Dekambu with an even more definite score of 5&4.
Woods, who had barely passed through his two games on Saturday, only occasionally demonstrated outbursts of his genius, but so far had 19 losses from 29 games in "fourball" and "foursome" matches, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who received a break for the morning "fourball" games, partnered with Henrik Stenson in the "foursome" clashes in the 2&1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copca – the number one and number three respectively in the world.
However, the team of Europe failed to enjoy a completely pleasant, cool and cloudless day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas gave the Americans back their hopes by winning two points on Saturday.
They achieved a difficult 2§1 victory against Spaniard John Ram and Jan Polter in the "fourball" matches, and later returned to defeat Polter and Rory McElroy by 4&3 in the "foursome" meetings, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has a team happened to catch up four points of deficit before the singles, according to the regulation, with Furrick's team keeping the trophy even in a draw.
However, after being outplayed in two consecutive days, their chances of a Sunday turn are not very great.
North Korea says there's "no way" to disarm one-sided, trustless
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the UN Saturday that continuing sanctions deepened distrust of the United States and there is no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the world organization, Ri Yong-hou said that "significant measures of goodwill have been taken in the past year", for example, we stop nuclear and missile tests, destruction of the nuclear test site and promises not to distribute nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without having confidence in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security and under no circumstances will we first disarm one-sided."
While Ri expressed North Korea's known complaints about Washington's resistance against a "staged" approach to eliminate nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it had taken gradual measures, his statement seemed significant as it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement from Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for "nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula", and Trump gave security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950–1953 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls to ease the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists "first to remove nuclear weapons" and increase pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and even object to the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a meaningless dream of those who do not know us.
The problem, however, is that continuing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting was planned between Kim and Trump, for which the U.S. leader stressed through the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister emphasized on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-In over the past five months and added: "If the country on the issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a standstill.
However, Ri's tone of speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean missiles to the mainland of the United States was inevitable after "the evil president" Trump called Kim "a man-rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with "total destruction", praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said that much still remains to be done and sanctions must remain in force while North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
Wednesday, Trump stressed that there was no deadline for this and said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must necessarily continue until full, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is implemented."
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear program and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly's colloari and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip on went well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but just a few hours later North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile site and nuclear complex if the United States took "the appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that "the corresponding measures" he sought were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students on a class for enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year led all students to sleep more in an effort to fight the growing culture of learning "all night" using caffeine.
A teacher found that students at number one university in the world often don't even consider when it comes to the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Keysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical Faculty and a specialist at the Brigham Hospital and the Women's Hospital, prepared the course he thought was the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"A girl came to me at the end and said, "Why are they only telling me this now, in my senior year?"
She said that no one has ever talked to her about the importance of the dream that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being held for the first time this year, explains to students the most important thing about how good sleeping habits help academic and sporting achievements, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Bareira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical Faculty and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were suffering from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
One-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is an image of a room in a dorm where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to explain to them the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are influenced by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the routine of bedtime.
Another part of the participants relates how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health effects of the choice to smoke," Professor Kaisler added.
The pride culture of "all night learning" still exists, he says and added that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students mean sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring sufficient and quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he says – even in order to avoid getting fat, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Keysler prepare the course by taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says his course "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step is for all graduate students to be asked to complete such a curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kaisler recommends that students think about setting a bedtime and wake-up alarm and knowing the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can upset the circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal crushed Gerard's team
The Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's jester crushed Stephen Gerard's visionless team and brought a 1–0 win for Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record its first victory as a guest of the February triumph with 4–1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only suffered Gerard's second defeat in his 18 games as manager, which left his team with eight points less than Harts' break-out team, a leader in the Ladbrokes Premier League.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers' design-deprived team at no time seemed close to leveling.
After the game, the Rangers fell in sixth place, and Livingston were now third, lagging behind the second Hibernian only by goal difference.
For the Rangers there may be additional problems as side judge Callum Spence received a head wound after being hit with an object that was apparently thrown by guest fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that defeated Air in the semi-finals of the Scotland League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with Livingston's same eleventh, who pulled a point against Harts last week, and should be pleased with the way his aggressive team paried all the opponent's actions.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball's mastery, but Livingston did better in the rarer cases when they owned it.
They were to score at the second minute when Menga brought out Scott Pittman with one touch against goalie Alan McGregor, but the midfielder missed the good opportunity.
A later centre of Keegan Jacobs from a foul found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgow turned the ball aside from the rear beam.
The Rangers took control of the game, but failed to create anything meaningful in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely felt there should be a penalty in the 15th minute when he confronted Stephen Lawless, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers fired only two exact kicks in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly handled the Lassana Kulibali head blow and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livy's 34th minute hit was surprising in view of possession of the ball, it was fully deserved.
The Rangers again failed to cope with a deep concentration of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher pointed the ball at Scott Robinson, who cold-bloodedly passed to Menga, for whom it was easy to realise.
Gerard responded to the break by replacing Kulibali with Ryan Kent and this shift almost immediately resulted when the wing handed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the hit.
Livingston, however, continued to force guests to play in a host-friendly game style, with Litgow and Halket constantly pulling the long balls sent forward.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor managed to deal with Jacobs' strike, and in the subsequent Corner Litgow fired his head past the beam.
The Rangers' Reserved Glenn Middleton requested a penalty at the end of the fight after a match with Jacobs, but Thomson again saw nothing wrong with the situation.
Yearbook: Geiger counter inventor
Page from our Sunday Morning yearbook: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROENE... the day that future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as a Geiger counter.
A cragstone in science since then, the Geiger counter has also become the cornerstone of pop culture when the film Coronado Bells was released in 1950, in which the seemingly amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated.
Man: “What in God’s name is this?
Rogers: It is a geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released in radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure it's giving a shit right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells
A new vaccine against cancer can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many types of cancer and are injected back into the patient
The test vaccine showed promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who trained the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them into a laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-inject themselves into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "impresses the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal carcinoma, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "training" how to target cancer cells was used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat labeled "Let's make America Great again", when participating in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was booed at the studio during Saturday Night Live after doing a pointless performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song of the evening called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat labeled "Let's Make America Great again", he declared himself against Democrats and stated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people very often and they ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate legal commission for sexual assault complaints made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's performance recording was uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear why Rock tried to make fun of West with his publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience about having problems backstage because of his hat.
"I've been harassed behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't wear that hat."
I've been harassed!
And then they claim I'm on a sinking ship," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the sinking ship?", claiming to wear Superman's suit because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try love."
Comments sparked at least twice booing from the audience and SNL team members seemed embarrassed, Variety said, one of them said, "The whole studio silenced."
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with a performance of the song "I Love it", dressed as a bottle "Perrier".
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR MEETING THE TRUST."
However, the current anchor show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just "she was herself, and that's wonderful."
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his 'art'), about whom I think he welcomes and distributes an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That's who we are," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper reported on Twitter that he had changed his name, now "is known officially as Kenny West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, and followed Didi's example, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Didi.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dog, was called Snoop Lyon, and music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol.
Charge of attempted murder after stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred at Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Highway Court on Monday.
The charges will be heard by the prosecutor's office.
The star of "Gammon A Thrones" Kit Harrington is against toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for the role of John Snow waving sword in a violent medieval fantasy series of HBO's "Gammon of Thrones".
But the actor, who is 31, declared himself against the stereotype of the macho character, saying that showing such roles on the screen resulted in young people often thinking they should be "curvy" to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his "Game of Thrones partner" Rose Leslie, also 31, admits to feeling "hardly convinced" that this problem must be resolved.
"At the moment, I am personally convinced – what have we wronged in terms of manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach growing men regarding the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to many manly characters.
He continued: “What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught by television and on the street that makes boys feel that they should become this particular type of men?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
Because obviously something's wrong for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in a prestory or sequels of "Games of Thrones" after the series ended the following summer, claiming to have "completed with battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kitt will play in Sam Shepherd's True West reenactment, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so that's how he gave me my future family and set my life ahead," he said.
Rose plays Gait, the girl Kit John Snow's character falls in love with the fantasy series winning the Emmy Award.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
According to health services, more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases were caused by sexual contacts, which marked a change compared to the past.
Traditionally HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of a transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was reduced almost to zero, China's health services said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, every year the number of those living with HIV and spin in China increases by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997 homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in KGB communities was widespread.
According to studies due to conservative values, 70–90% of men who have had sexual intercourse with men end up marrying women.
Many cases of disease transmission are due to improper protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the government of China pledged to provide universal access to HIV medication as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that there is a leak of data on Republican Party senators, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters condemned the allegations that a member of her team had published personal information to three state senators from Republicans on the legislators' pages in Wikipedia.
Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were made by experts and "ultra right wing sites".
"Lies, lies, and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a hearing of the Senate's composition on charges of immoral sexual conduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh.
The leak was carried out after the three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the publications was connected to Waters' office, and released information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked criticism online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"There is anger in this denial," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament suitable for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be challenging.
He must not question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to be calm and balanced."
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to criticism by Justice Cavanaugh's Democrats, who was accused by critics of also looking angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters' seat in the interim election, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"Substantial, if true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had referred to the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure the perpetrators are revealed," she continued, "and that they will be legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
Review of "Johnny English erupts again" – the weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for references to Brexit in any new film with British participation and it seems that this also applies to the revival of action-comedy, spy franchise for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with "Johnny English returns".
Will the self - laugh and the mimes that speak of how obvious it is that we are stupid become a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, incompetent Johnny English with eyed eyes and "a rubber" face has the permission to renew things for the second time—his name is of the greatest importance when it comes to a large comic creation intended for movie fans who do not speak English.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of flattery, owns some of Clouseau, some of Mr Bean and much of the man who contributed with a note on the music theme Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympic Games opening ceremony.
In addition, it was originally based on the leaving chaos behind a traveler and international man whom Atkinson played in Barclaycard's already forgotten television commercials.
In the last movie with Johnny English, there are either two good moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing medieval armor and briefly the fins clanked into his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy and obvious, but humor is quite weak and strangely redundant, especially when "serious" film brands such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humor seems more focused on children rather than adults, but Johnny English's wacky mishaps, in my opinion, are not innovative and focused, as the no play of Actinson reminds Mr Bean.
The current premise is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker hacked into the British supersecret network of spies and revealed the identity of all operational terror agents of the duty agent—unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is a pompous and pompous figure and already suffers from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her all for this quasi-Tereza-May role, but in the script there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her she needs to call a retired agent, as all active agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a teacher at a fancy center, who, however, illegally teaches lessons on how to be an undercover agent: there are some good hits here when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English was called to Whitehall for emergency instruction and reunited with his former longtime assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a family man married to a submarine commander, a merry role in which Vicky Pepperdin's talent is a bit wasted.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's secret services and face the fatally beautiful Ofelia Bouletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their odyssey of farces: disguised as waiters, set fire to a French restaurant; create chaos when they sneak into Volta's luxury yacht; and English provokes true anarchy when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to get to know the interior of Volta's house.
All the laughs are certainly taken from the previous film, but since there is so sympathetic and violent, there is much more content here intended for children.
It's a pretty mediocre production.
Just like other Johnny English films, I keep thinking, can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that meets his talent?
Labour denied that they were developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to receive a pay for five.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party considered a radical plan, according to which the British would work four weeks, but to receive pay for five.
The party claims that it wants company chiefs to provide savings made through the revolutionary artificial intelligence (II), to workers by giving them another day off.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but to receive the same pay.
Sources say the idea would "fall" the economic program and the party's plans to shake the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Trade union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A top source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected before the end of the year is reported for a policy review.
"It will not happen immediately, but the four-day working week is an aspiration that fits into the approach of rebalancing the economy in favour of workers as well as in the party's common industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
At the moment, however, this drive does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
Labour spokesman said, "The four-day working week is not in party politics is not considered by it."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from the "inpersonal directors" and "speculators" in utility firms.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current share owners in water supply companies may not receive their full share, as the Labour government could impose "retentions" on the basis of the detected violations.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on companies' boards and create privatisation funds to transfer 10 percent of net capital to private employees' companies that can accumulate annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy speak in front of "60 Minutes" if Cavanaugh's investigation by the FBI could change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed his final vote on the Supreme Court nomination by at least one week and raised the question whether bureau findings could have led some Republican party senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Party Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after that statement came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, firm and unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion about Brett Cavanaugh and to change it, a shaking accusation is needed," he said.
"Dr Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it categorically," Graham added, addressing Christine Blasius Ford.
"And no one she mentioned but could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive composition of performers and performs an equally impressive mission: eliminating poverty around the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the grand lawn in Central Park, which will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, but will also become acquainted with the true purpose of the event – eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international protection group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively struggling with it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "actions" such as voluntary participation, sending no email to a world leader, phone call or other means to help raise awareness about their poverty elimination goal.
But how successful was the Global Citizen 12 years before achieving his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genius way to be persuaded to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clitivism"—people think they do something significant when they sign an online petition or send a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who insist for numerous different purposes.
It says that these actions helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which would affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and messages stemming from its actions, with at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group believes that the funds provided have already had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include the Power of Nutrition, established in the UK a partnership between investors and performers, engaging in "assisting children to develop their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda with 35 million dollars to help end malnutrition in the country after more than 4,700 posts were received on Twitter by "global citizens".
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens such as yourselves, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition simply into a historical note," said UK Power Ambassador Tracy Ulman to the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken that called for Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government had announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website asking, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
"Global Citizen" replied: This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail and still fail.
But just like in the big civil rights movement and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers of this year's New York event, to which Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will lead.
US may use naval forces to "block" and hinder energy exports – Interior Minister
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering markets, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zink revealed, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zink argues that Russia's engagement in Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they did in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that sea roads are open and, if necessary, block them to make sure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink addressed attendees at the event organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presented itself as the "voice of energy users" in the United States.
It aimed to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
"The economic option with regard to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, fuel stimulation and replacement," he said, while describing Russia as "one number pony", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked to boost the exports of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says turns Berlin into "a hostage".
Moscow has stressed several times that the $11 billion pipeline of North Stream 2, which will double existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's zealous opposition to the project was dictated simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share our perspective, energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position sparked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German organization in industry, the Federation of German Industry (DBDI), urged the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look" at the 2020 presidential run, Massachusetts Senator says.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "look seriously" at the presidential run after the interim election.
During a Holyoke City Council, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It is time for women to enter Washington and fix our broken government and this includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take a serious look at the presidential run."
Warren expressed his judgment regarding President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he "leaded this country in the wrong direction.
"I worry to the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A sociological survey conducted Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren herself's voters did not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported this application.
The sociological survey showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for and 48 percent against.
Other senior Democratic Party officials discussed in terms of potential running in 2020 included former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed to Truck Palin's AKP at a rally for Donald Trump
Truck Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrollment in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"What my own son is going through after returning is familiar to other families who feel the effects of the AKP and some of the wounds our soldiers are going home with," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a slot in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they returned a little changed, hardened, returned and wondered if they would get that respect themselves and their brothers in arms gave the country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, he was included in a report on domestic violence and possession of intoxicated weapons, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Vasila police department.
18 states and D.C. support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and D.C. support the court contesting a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims of gang violence and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from the 18 states and the county filed a request of goodwill in Washington in support of asylum seekers and challenging politics, NBC News reported.
The entire name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions case has not been revealed, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal politics in August.
She claimed that her partner "and the sons of the cruel members of his gang" abused her, but American officials rejected the asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
State lawyers helping Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum candidates came to the United States, as nations facing comprehensive gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy returned the decision of the 2014 immigration appeal board, which allowed immigrants documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
D.C. attorney Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "imposed decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined according to specific facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates this principle," the goodwill report says.
In addition, lawyers argue in the report that the policy, which refuses to enter immigrants, damages the American economy by pointing out that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "to provide the necessary labour."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Secios ordered judges in immigration cases to suspend asylum for victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"A sanctuary is given to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear over race, religion, nationality or membership in a specific social group or political beliefs," Secios said in his 11 July policy announcement.
The sanctuary never intended to alleviate all problems—not even all serious ones—that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, while deaths doubled during search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her sick boy in an evacuation center in the devastated town of Palu.
"Every minute of ambulance carries more corpses.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to rescue something from their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were crowded.
Some of the victims, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a spine and shoulder fracture, were accommodated outside Army Hospital in Palou, where patients were treated outdoor due to ongoing aftershocks.
His eyes fill with tears when I recall how he felt the cruel earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he had shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed into the ruined wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that he had come to town with the family to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "harassment" with "propagand commercials"
One week after an official newspaper in China released a four-page advertisement in an American daily about the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the United States Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid publication at Des Moines Register – Iowa State's top-selling newspaper – after accusing China of seeking to intervene in the 6 November U.S. Congress election. A charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Pecky is trying to intervene the election for the U.S. Congress, noted what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to launch commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an escalating trade war in which they equalise import tariffs between countries.
According to experts from the United States and China at the beginning of the trade war, customs tariffs in China were intended to strike exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in a commentary in the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, "is currently doubling this harassment by launching propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, China's government benefited from America's respected tradition of freedom of speech and press by launching paid advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here, in Beijing, you will find limited speeches and you will not see a real coverage of the divergent opinions the Chinese people may have regarding China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoided the proposal to publish" his article, although he did not specify exactly who.
With Cavanaugh's defeat, Republicans repel voters women for interim elections, analysts warn
As many of the high-ranking Republicans stand behind and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh in connection with several sexual assault charges, analysts warned that there would be a response, particularly from women, during the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions surrounding the tray are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they wish to continue with a vote.
These things cannot be turned back," said Grant Raher, professor of political science at Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Raher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute insistence (R-Arizona) to investigate by the FBI would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington's newspaper.
Friday morning, protesters chanted "November comes!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as Republicans who control the judiciary decided to continue Cavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasius Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded," Stu Rothenberg, a partyless political analyst, told news.
"People say the problem is already serious; it is true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among voters women in the suburbs and younger voters, between 18 and 29, who often don't vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her sexual assault charges against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a response might follow if Republicans insist on confirming the candidacy.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote, the final vote or whether Cavanaugh was put on the bench. It's about the way Republicans deal with it and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps select Democrats.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided on who to trust in the aftermath of Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, with little more leaning towards the second.
A new sociological study by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say they definitely or probably believe Cavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent say that according to them Cavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent claim the same of Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judicial Commission that Cavanaugh attacked her in an intoxicated state when she was 17.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate had shown his genitals to her while they were at a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of World Wide Web Tim Burners-Lee began an undertaking that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the Berners-Lee Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said regarding the venture.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "online repository of personal data" or POD.
It contains lists, tasks lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional instruments.
Looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify that are available through each browser, and at the same time is all of them simultaneously.
The unique thing about the online repository of personal data is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company called it "giving personal data powers."
The idea of Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, was the company to put resources, processes and appropriate skills in place to help Solid become available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Burners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developers who signed a project work contract, and a group of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change or not when all their business models were fully updated overnight.
"We do not ask permission from them."
In a publication at Medium on Saturday, Burners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission was to provide energy for trade and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid.
In 1994, Burners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
In recent months, Burners-Lee has had a strong influence in the debate about network neutrality.
Despite launching Inrupt, Burners-Lee will remain the founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet," Burners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: in memory of the priest awarded Victoria Cross in World War I
They were celebrated for 100 years in the hometown of the only Anglican priest awarded the Victoria Cross for his involvement in combat during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without realizing that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honours.
A memorial monument opened Saturday by his two grandchildren, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" to open the monument exactly 100 years from his grandfather's trial awarded a medal.
According to London Gazette on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from artillery and machine guns."
He later attacked the line of fire and with "incredible bravery" he built forward before attacking an artillery cannon with one hand and killing three of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do, but it makes me humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Van placed a wreath after the parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was "a great honor to participate in the parade" and added "the valor of the true hero is demonstrated through the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead received Peppa Pig
Imagine that you've been waiting all night to watch a full edition of Bellator 206 and you can't finally witness the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six of the main map and had to air live at night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6:00, just when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain were stunned when the show changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after being up to the early hours, especially because of the fight.
Fan described on Twitter the switching of the children's cartoon as "some kind of sick joke".
"The government rules that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so the program was changed to a children's show," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, in response to a broadcast question.
"Peppa pig," yes."
Company President Bellator Scott Cocker said they would work on meeting planning to include UK viewers in the future.
"In my opinion, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Coker said.
"There, however, is six in the morning on Sunday and we cannot plan things so that the event will take place here on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received a lot of messages and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't like that, he was government.
I can promise you next time that won't happen.
We will stick to including five fights instead of six – as we normally do. We tried to provide more to the fans, but we went too far.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt "lower" due to his sexuality
Olympic jumper in water Tom Daly says he grew up feeling lower than everyone else due to his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claimed that until he started studying in secondary school, he did not realize that "not everyone is like me."
In an interview for the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he talked about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he became less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The permanent host of the longtime show, Kirsty Young, was in hospital for several months.
While participating in Laverne Daily's first program, he said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up, as "it was socially acceptable to like girls and boys."
He said: "To this day, the feeling of inferiority and that I am different from others are actually the things that give me energy and power to succeed."
He wanted to prove that it was "something", he said, so as not to disappoint anyone when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year's British Community Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he was happy that he could live openly, without consequences, and wished to inspire "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man -- American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- had "surprised him."
Daly married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him, last year, but claimed that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much while you're so young"—he took part for the first time at the 14th Olympics, and his father died of cancer three years later—he said, "it's hard to find someone your age who's experienced such ups and downs."
The two became parents in June and had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daly himself said that "his whole worldview" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that all I cared about was winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said that his father could not accept that he would die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympic Games – as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't be there for me, Dad, or in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and at that point when I found out he was dead, I finally admitted he wasn't invulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that all my life I had dreamed about it – jumping at the Olympic Games in front of the audience at home. There was no greater feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song – "Proud" by Heather Small – which accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympic Games and still made him shiver.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 p.m., British Summer Time.
Lost form Mikkelson remains on the bench for Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mikkelson will set a record Sunday when he will play his 47th game at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to regain his old form if he does not want his record to be linked to a failure.
Mikkelson, who participated in the two-year event held for the record 12th time, was left on the bench by Captain Jim Furrick for "fourball" and "foursome" matches on Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure again in the United States team, the five-time winner of major tournaments spent his day as a fan and in training his long-distance hits in hopes of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who, even at the top of his career, was never among the straightest players, was not in optimal shape for "Le Golf National"'s difficult court, where the long bumpy terrain usually punishes every wrong blow.
And if the field itself is not disturbing enough, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mikkelson will face the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is in a team with rookie Tommy Flatwood and seek to win all four games this week.
If Americans who trailed four points before the 12 single games made a strong start, it might turn out that Mikkelson's game was absolutely crucial.
Furrick expressed confidence in his teammate, though he could hardly say anything much different.
"He fully understood his role today, patted my back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furrick said.
"He's confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given so much in both the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing in just two games.
I expected him to play more, but it just happened, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else."
Mikkelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for the most matches at the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
This could end his career at the Ryder Cup, which never came close to his impressive individual achievements.
Mikkelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equal matches, but Furrick said his presence also brought other benefits to the team that were not measured by numbers.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with people and is a great guy for every team," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the big lead could soon be melted.
The captain of the team of Europe, Thomas Björn, knows from personal experience that the big lead accumulated before the single matches from Ryder Cup's last day can be easily erased.
The Dane debuted in the 1997 Valderrama game when the team with Captain Seve Balisteros led by five points in front of the Americans, but right in the final rights he was almost caught up and barely managed to hold the victory by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You continue to remind yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama we won, but very difficult," Bjorn said after the 2018 team won 5–3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, leading with 10–6 to "Le Golf National:
So the story has to show me and everyone on the team that it's not all over.
Prepare for attack tomorrow.
Go out and do what you have to do.
Nothing's over until you see the final score on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try and win this trophy, and that's what we need to stay focused on.
I've been saying all along that I only think about the 12 players on our team, but we're also aware of our rivals, who are one of the greatest players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of the players on a difficult golf course, Björn added: "I would never rush the celebrations.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, individual performances will come out in the foreground, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, then you test your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message that must reach the players: tomorrow you must do your best.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he must also be dealt out to the end."
Unlike Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furrick would ask his players to perform better individually than as partners, with exceptions being only Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas who took three out of four possible points.
Furrick himself was on both sides of these major reverses on the last day – he was part of the triumph of "Brookline", and then was on the losing side when Europeans performed "The Wonder of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw on "Brookline", as well as on "Medinah".
When the advantage goes from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches are played under tremendous pressure.
So we formed our composition and distributed our boys the way we want to, to try and do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with leading our counterattack and facing Rory McElroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Polter would meet the other Europeans in the top half of the arrangement.
"I chose these players in this order because I think it gives us the best chance of success," Björn said of his choice for the singles.
Germany postponed the launch of a new battleship again
The latest frigate of the German Navy had to be put into service in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War war war warships, but this would not take place until at least next year due to malfunctioning systems and colossally growing costs, local media reported.
The introduction into service of Rheinland-Pfalz, the brand's leading ship of new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cited an army spokesman.
The sailing court was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships commissioned by the fleet in 2007 would replace the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, e.g. reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest frigates should be able to be used up to two years before returning to home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that advanced warships—which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power overseas—will now be old when they go into operation, Die Zeit noted.
The unfortunate F125 frigate entered the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and brought it back to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned a ship to a ship of ship after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of substantial "software and hardware defects" that made the warship unusable if sent on a combat mission.
Software flaws are particularly important as Baden-Wuerttemberg-class craft will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of older frigates of the Bremen class.
In addition, it turned out that the ship was significantly overloaded, which reduced its efficiency and limited the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar class used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – also becomes a problem.
It is believed to have reached the stunning 3.1 billion euros ( $3.6 billion) -- of the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest frigates became particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval forces were shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet was actually "exhausted from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said that the problem had become larger in time, as the old ships were decommissioned, but no new ships were made available.
He complained that no frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the fleet.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats.
A new study carried out in a mansion in the Scottish mountains aims to establish how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hopes are that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help lead future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow the common bats as well as brown straddle water nightdresses in Inverewe Gardens at Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations on the estate to track bat activities during the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's call sounds, as well as which species produce them.
A map of habitat and a report will then be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by any species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and in Britain have generally decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by the construction activities that affect their refuges and lead to habitat loss.
Risk to populations may be from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical handling of building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact bats are not blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to capturing prey.
They use advanced echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles along their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The Trust has trained experts conducting regular surveys, inspections of shelters and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even created the first in Scotland and the only special bat reserve in the Treave Manor in the Dumfreece and Galloway district, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
The estate manager David Thompson says it's perfect territory for them.
"Here, in Treave, we have a great pitch for bats," he noted.
"We have old buildings, many adult trees and a suitable habitat completed.
But there are many other things about bats that are not known, so the work we do here and in other estates will help us better understand what they need to flourish."
He emphasises that it is important to check for the presence of bats before property maintenance activities are carried out, as it is possible that involuntary destruction of an asylum will kill up to 400 female and young bats, as well as destroy an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Farrell, Scottish employee at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged society to help.
She said, "I still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our animal species, as we simply do not know what happens to their populations."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape and his lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described allegations of rape against him as "fake news", saying people "want to become famous", using his name.
His lawyers will sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which publishes these claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was charged with rape of American Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was said to have then paid her $375 000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a video on Instagram, addressing his 142 million followers, a few hours after the allegations were published, 33-year-old Ronaldo condemned the publication as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is fake news," the five-time goldball winner told the camera.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain popularity on my back, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and it's all right," the footballer smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations they call "ineligible publication of privacy suspicions", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would request compensation for "moral damages of an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, possibly one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
It is said that the incident in question occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claimed that after the incident Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her he was a "good boy" to "99 percent", but in this case he simply succumbed to the "one percent".
According to the records, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but it happened with her consent.
Majorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries in hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court agreement because she felt "h horrified with revenge" and was worried not to "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she is willing to cancel the agreement as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident in question.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian Grand Juventus for the sum of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain "will regret forever" that it has lost car manufacturers
Britain "will regret forever", if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worried" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at their plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
Japan's car manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the case of Brexit without a deal could result in job losses.
At the plant in Burnaston – where the Auris and Avensis models are produced – last year nearly 150,000 cars were produced, 90% of which were exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU in late March, production at our plant will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bournaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade would operate.
BMW, for example, said they would close their plant for the Mini model in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks to the supply chain in Brexit cases without a deal.
Toyota's production line works on the "right on time" principle, with the parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers from both Britain and the EU for custom-made cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be problems at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota would be impossible to wait more than one day to fill out their inventory at the factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and therefore production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's "shahmat" plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We have to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy current success, but to be able to seize this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio's 4's Today program.
"After the claims not only to Toyota, but also to other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we should be able to continue to provide successful supply chains."
Toyota cannot say how long production will be stopped, but in the longer term warn that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who has been working in Bournaston for 24 years and has been the founder of the Unite Union at the plant, said his members are increasingly worried: "From my experience, I judge that if these jobs go away, they will never return.
A spokesman for the government said, "We have laid out an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, the White House says
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed with another week", as candidate for Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh continued, the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian intervention in elections, links between Trump and Russia aids and potential obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney, or not, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has been feeding rumors about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this claim.
But last Monday, he went to the White House after reports of resigning.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations seat in New York, a meeting with him was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not to" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the hearing before the Senate legal committee, which they testified about both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI of complaints against Cavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday on Fox News.
When asked a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "It may not yet be this week, but seeing all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court, I think it may be postponed for next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would argue this claim: Sanders had not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
The host of the show Chris Wallace asked for the reason.
Sanders replied that rare press conferences were not due to dislike for the "demonstrative behavior" of television journalists, although he said, "I cannot say that I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior."
She then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president conducts more questions and answers than any president before him," she said, adding, without quoting evidence: "We checked these stats."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but "if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, this is far better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do this a lot, and you've seen us practice it quite often in recent weeks, and this will replace the press conferences since you have the opportunity to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting high officials.
Self-contained press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and at times strange behavior before the gathered journalists.
The Health Minister addressed EU workers in the National Health Service of Scotland regarding the fears associated with Brexit
The Health Minister in writing addressed EU staff working in the National Health Service of Scotland to express the state's appreciation and desire to remain in their seats after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months left until Britain's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to the costs of the procedures established for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between Britain and the EU on leaving continued, and decisions are expected this fall.
But the UK government also advanced in its preparations for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain period for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to remind you how much I value the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond contribute with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is beneficial to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would very much like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after having a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers' linebacker, Christian Abercrombie, suffered an emergency surgery after having a head injury during Saturday's meeting when his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores by 31-27, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State's senior coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He went to the sideline and somehow just passed out there," Reid said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the sideline before he was laid on a stretcher and was taken to the dressing rooms for further examination.
Tennessee State employee confirmed to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had exited surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details of the type/seriousness of the trauma", as well as that Tennessee State are trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore on a college scholarship, was for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five blockages before leaving the match, making a total of 18 blocks for him this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher coat of arms levy when buying real property in the UK
According to new Conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher coat of arms levy in buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds helping the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The promotion in the crested levy will affect those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The state treasury expects an increase of over £120 million a year, which will help the homeless
Teresa May will announce today the decision for foreign buyers to pay a higher coat of arms levy in buying real estate in the UK, with additional revenues going to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters by promising more affordable housing and targeting people with high incomes.
The promotion of the coat of arms levy will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional revenues helping the government's efforts to limit the number of people who sleep on the street.
The supplement – which is an addition to the current coat of arms levy, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for dedication purposes – can amount to up to three percent.
The state Treasury expects the proceeds to rise by up to £120 million per year.
About 13 percent of newly built buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the UK, resulting in price increases and making it difficult for individuals buying property for the first time to intervene in the property market.
Many of the rich districts – especially in the capital – have become "ghost cities", due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
New politics only appeared a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the coat of arms levy to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by plundering land but not using it, and asked Mrs May to abandon affordable housing quotas to correct Britain's "house disgrace".
Mr. Corbin announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reforms, including rent control and the end of expulsions "without guilt".
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would like to dedicate my time as prime minister to restore the British dream – the life of every new generation to be better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who wish to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for individuals who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, to buy as easily homes as hard-working UK residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has gone too far in time, and the insult of sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scotland team"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said that the "largest ambition" of his career was to be a senior coach of the Scotland national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman accepted the challenge to revive the club from northeast England, currently in third position in the First League, three points from the first place.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after last season taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded one game for the B team and that was it," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up with the Scotland matches of Hempden, which as a child we watched together with my father, so the national team has always attracted me.
"However, this opportunity would only be opened if I had success at club level."
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers were names such as Dick Advocate, David Mois, Sam Allerdais, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poet and Paolo Di Cannio.
Former Aloa Athletic mentor said he was not concerned as a successor to such established names in such a famous club, previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, success at the moment will be measured with a positive answer to the question "Can I return this club to the Premier League?"
Because by structure, base and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to go back to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross was only a manager for three years after spending some time as an assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months at Harts' coaching headquarters.
He then helped Aloa not to fall into the Third Division and turned St Mirren from a falling team into a Championship winner the following season.
Ross shared that he now felt more comfortable than during his career as a footballer in Clyde, Hartlipul, Volkerk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I was really at a crossroads," he remembers when he took Aloa.
"I really believed that being a manager was the best thing for me, including being an active player.
It sounds weird because I was doing well, making good money, and I had some significant success.
But being a player is sometimes hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still facing the same levels of stress and pressure at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I'm really doing it, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin in my entire conscious life."

Perfect time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals research
Summer heat increased the revenues of struggling British pubs for survival, but gained more tension for restaurant chains.
Clubs of pubs and bars reported sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased 4.8 percent, statistics show.
Peter Martin of the business consultant CGA, who compiled the statistics, said: "Because of the prolonged sunny weather and longer than England's expected World Cup participation, a similar model as June followed in July when pubs reported an increase of 2.8 percent, but restaurants received an even stronger blow.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
The pubs and bars for drinks reported the best results in their height, compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
Food pubs also suffered from sunny weather, but not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, liquor sales jumped 6.6 percent in the month, while in food there was a 3 percent reduction."
Paul Newman, of leisure and entertainment analysts RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we noticed in late April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the service sector outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a decline in sales by 4.8 percent on an annual basis may be particularly painful in addition to permanent costs.
The long hot summer could not appear at a worse time for food restaurant managers, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring such a desired rest."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly discovered, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the delay in the brand deployment.
Coffee Peak Tracker, the sales analyst in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in the UK, collected and analyzed performance data from 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over £9 billion, and was an established indicator in the industry.
One in five children hides a secret profile from his parents on a social network
One in five children – some only at 11 – has a secret social networking profile, which he hides from his parents and teachers, revealed a study
A survey conducted among 20,000 secondary school students shows the growth of fake Instagram pages
News has raised fears that sexual material is being published
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" profile that showed their parents
One out of five children – some in 11 – creates a social network profile that keeps secret from adults.
A survey among 20,000 middle school students showed growth in fake Instagram accounts – a reference to Instagram photo sharing site.
News has raised fears that sexual material is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main" profile that showed their parents, while also having secret profiles.
A mother who ran into the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage child who encouraged others to "rape him."
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 have two profiles, with half of them acknowledging that they keep their profiles secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It is worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eiled Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the Board of Athletics in Scotland
Eiled Doyle was elected to join the Board of Athletics in Scotland as director without executive functions at the annual General Assembly of the Managing Authority.
Doyle is Scotland's light athlete with the most achievements, and Chairman Ian Beatty described this move as a great opportunity for those leading in sports to benefit from her rich experience at international level over the past decade.
"Aileid enjoys great respect in the athletic communities of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly with its attraction," Beatty said.
Doyle said, "I wish to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help promote sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres finals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, adding to his total four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator at the BBC, lost the ability to walk after having had a transient ischemic seizure.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I achieved full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I am doing mobility training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
The milk pump commercial, which compares mothers to cows, splits online opinions
A company producing breast milk pumps split online opinions with an ad that compares nursing mothers to cows that are milking.
To mark the placing on the market of the expected "first silent breast pump in the world suitable for wearing", consumer technology company Elvis launched the joke music-video advertising to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides for nursing women to show themselves.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn full of hay, amid a song with text including: "Yes, I milked, but you don't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not a udder, it's my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk your girlfriends."
Advertising, however, published on the company's Facebook page, caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying that it diminishes the "awful" of the dairy industry.
"It is a very foolish decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
The breast milk pump Elvie is collected discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them for advertising a breast-feeding pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone added, "So inadequate advertising."
Others defended the ad, with one woman acknowledging that she considered the song "extremely entertaining".
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy one if I was still breast-feeding.
The drain made me feel exactly like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I accept it the way it is.
This product is genius," someone wrote.
Another comment: "It's a ridiculous ad directed at mothers who care (often at their jobs or in the toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not an ad praising or condemning the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they danced with the discrete pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who are breast-feeding feel like cows.
However, Elvie pump is completely silent, no wires or pipes and is collected discreetly in a breast-feeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, to keep their babies and even to go outside as they drain.
Anna Balarin, partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative marketing.
With the drawing of a parallel between breast-feeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to breast-feeding and all the challenges associated with it, while showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible feeling of freedom that will bring the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has fallen into the lead news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the podium for designer Martha Yakubowski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrants' children have been secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrants' children jumped sharply, although monthly crossings at the border remained relatively unchanged, partly because sharp rhetoric and politics by the Trump administration made it difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Usually, most guardians are immigrants without documents who fear to risk staying in the country if they wish to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other family adults should provide fingerprints, and these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high-ranking employee at the Immigration and Customs Service, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wished to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of the persons who are either guardians or members of the guardians' family, reside illegally in the country, many of them being foreign offenders.
So we will continue to pursue these faces," Albens said.
In an effort to cope faster with the registration of these children, authorities imposed new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as was the previous norm, according to officials at the shelter.
Many appear in a video conference conversation rather than personally to present their case of legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are identified as unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children remain detained, the more likely they become depressed or depressed, which may lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter officials and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as that in Tornillo, where signs of any child having problems are more likely to be ignored because of the scale of the site.
They added that moving children to the "palat town" without giving them enough time to prepare at an emotional level or to say goodbye to their friends may aggravated the trauma that many already struggle with.
Syria urges US, France, Turkey's "occupation troops" to withdraw immediately
With an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mullem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also held the position of Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign troops reside illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism and "the appropriate actions will be taken towards them".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he said at the meeting.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 30,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been violently displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would "continue fighting in this sacred battle until all Syrian lands were cleansed" by both terrorist organizations and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 servicemen in Syria who mainly train and advise both Kurdish parts and Syrians, opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 servicemen in the lands of the war-wrecked country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said the conditions were bearable and could return, accusing "some Western countries of "spiring groundless fears" that prompt refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to these returns," he said.
"They turn into a political issue something that is an entirely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given to the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to stop the war.
UN diplomats said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has enabled progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russia-backed Syrian forces over the province, where three million people live.
Mualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and voiced hope that hostilities would be targeted at jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-related Al Nusra front, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Stafan de Mystura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of the new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draw up a draft of Syria's post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Mualem laid out the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited to "review of members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump to win second term
By this logic, Trump will win a re-election in the 2020 election unless – as many Liberal viewers probably hope – his presidency is not terminated prematurely because of impeachment and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of weariness to the viewers.
Since 2014, primetime rating has doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News had an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show was on top of the cable television ratings, with up to 3.5 million viewers at big news dinners.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," says Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC's drama The Last Candidate, where it's told about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skovell, who is a veteran stager of comedies and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Feel Hard Truths About Snake Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked "Why?".
Mrs. Skovel told me that he replied "Because she makes me laugh."
There's fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, Washington-based stories can determine the future of Row vs. Wade, whether immigrants' families can reunite as well as the good state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, the desire to inform a citizen did not correspond to watching a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who used "deep historical information" as a source for his Fear book; Paul Manaforth's pilot jacket from ostrich skin for $15,000 ("a dress with a filling of arrogance" according to "Washington Post"), and the shocking descriptions of Stormy Daniels on Mr Trump's anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"A part of what he does to make you feel like part of a reality show is to give you a little every night," said Brent Montgomery, Chief Executive Producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", with regard to changing participants and daily twists (babbling with the National Football League, praising Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be behind.
When I contacted Mr. Flight this week, it was sunny, 80 degrees in the north coast of Cowai, but he had shut himself down at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't separate himself from the TV, especially when Brett Cavanaugh had to face the Senate's legal committee, and that depended on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization," Mr. Flight told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right".

Investments flow into the most contested race in early congressional seat election
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district received a stream of money thanks to the rearrangement of the counties of Congress and hence two holders for the same place.
The recently redistributed district in the suburbs of Pittsburgh points to conservative Democrat Connor Lamb, who won his seat from another district in partial elections last spring.
Lamb faced another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represented the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, who significantly advocated with the new 17th.
The maps were rewritten after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered in January that the old counties were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the main party funding institutions, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Commission (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Commission (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after the difficult victory in the widely discussed partial elections in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The position was held by Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts believe Democrats have a slight advantage.
US considered sanctions on El Salvador because of his support for China, then withdrew
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heart meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to recall the leaders of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, due to "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said earlier this month Heather Naworth, a spokesman for the Department.
But sanctions were envisaged only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about US$ 140 million of aid from America to fight drugs, for development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the state of Central America with its unemployment rate and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity, which served as a continuation of such a gathering last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent the influx of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, the senior management authorities clarified that their desire was for the conference to take place, effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Penns has now announced that he will participate in the conference planned for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, diplomats say.
All three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new strict messages or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats who wished to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also wished to remain anonymous.
History of the Study
The next move could be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, with the report currently being significant evidence in the public register.
Mr. Mueller is also said to direct his investigation into whether Mr. Trump plotted with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our elections.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to report to this authority, just when he is preparing to face the voters, as well as perhaps to a jury composed of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here and I do not suggest that Mr Trump's downfall is inevitable – neither is that of those like him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make these choices that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler as long as the West had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of the massacre.
The course of history depends on such key moments, and the relentless march of democracy speeds up or slows down.
At the moment, Americans face several similar key points.
What if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper announced that last year he had offered to secretly record the president and speculated that he was not fit for the post.
Mr Rosenstein announced the story in the Times was inaccurate.
"How would we react if the new investigation against Brett Cavanaugh, demanded by the FBI, was not complete or fair—or if it was approved for the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the early election for Congress if it will force Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these trials, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I believe we won't fail because I learned a lesson from Prague.
My mother was Jewish from Czechoslovakia, who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Shabbat candles at that table wearing a swastika.
With an inheritance like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to move forward from Group G of League Europe.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrance to play his first game of the season before the 2-2 equality in question with Villareal, but he believed that for Rangers this result could become a stepping stone to greater achievements.
"We won an important point because Villareal are a good opponent," said the 31-year-old footballer.
"We entered the game hoping that we could win something and left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but in general, equality seems a fair score.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
We've taken a look at Thursday, another big night of our games in Europe.
I hope that we will be able to fight for the three points, this will be a difficult match because they have achieved a good result in last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience, we can do our best and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely hard after everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but now things seem to be going in the right direction.
The team is good and the boys are really having fun, the workouts are useful.
I hope that we will be able to harness all forces to forget last season and achieve the desired successes."
Women worry about fears about their pension savings
Despite the fact that participants in the study had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted to receive, few people discussed this with family members.
About half of the participants in a Nationwide study share that they discussed with their husbands the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% have spoken to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but have not taken the steps to hold this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide's life insurance sector.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not declare your wishes in advance.
Together with your counselor and your family, discuss where and how you want to receive care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you with an idea of how to pay these costs.
Your decisions, when choosing a long-term care financial institution, may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed policy of life insurance with monetary value to help you cover these costs or self-insurance by your means – if you have cash resources.
Draw up your legal documents: Deal with the legal battles from the beginning.
Appoint a health care proxy so that you have a certain trustee to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also the idea of a commissioner in financial matters.
You can choose a trusted person to make the financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are unable.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer the questions about medicines and allergies?
Put these details in writing to be prepared.
"It's not just about the financial aspect, but also about who the doctors will be," Martin asked.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan."

The victim failed to see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are trying to draw witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died from a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities announced, with the death count expected to grow.
Due to interrupted communications, aid organisations could not obtain information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake than 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated to Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow beach strip on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379 800 in 2017.
The town celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck it.
Dongala is a regent that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which an administrative region smaller than a province, had an estimated population of 299200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of the province of central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by a tsunami in the past 100 years, according to Indonesian disaster recovery agency data.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Tsunami struck the western part of Dongala and in 1996, when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic "Pacific Fire Ring" and is regularly decimated by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunami waves in recent years:
2004: A strong quake on December 26 on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra activated a tsunami wave that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake decimated Indonesia's most populated island, Java, activating a tsunami that crashed in the south coast, destroying nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands and activated a 10-metre tsunami wave that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Pidi Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, no tsunami was activated, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong quakes decimated the tourist island of Lombock in Indonesia, killed more than 500 people, most of whom on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily at a standstill.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on domestic abuse charges.
Truck Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a notice of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report by Alaska State Police released Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was detained in the building for prior detention Matt-Su and under an unsecured $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, certainly", when asked to plead, the media reported.
Palin was threatened by punishment for three class A misdemeanors, meaning he could be deprived of liberty for up to a year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B misdemeanor who was punished by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently being considered by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of drug users in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she connected her son's aggressive behavior with posttraumatic stress stemming from his service in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died from an earthquake that hit Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electric and communication network is disrupted, with the number of dead expected to grow in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulavesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital – Jakarta.
Social networks spin videos that show the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami wave hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors from New York want the death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack, in which eight people died—a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a 1953 federal crime.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the October bombing of the West Side highway near the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, draughting pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov "willfully" killed eight victims and "willfully" caused severe bodily damage, according to the intent notice in connection with the death penalty request filed in South District, New York.
According to the court document, both charges could end with a death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, an expanded federal courthouse filed a 22-point indictment to Saipov, including eight counts of murder involving racketeering, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of vehicles.
The attack required "serious planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov committed himself as "terrible, cruel and perverted".
"Syfulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clevez, Anne-Laurie Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Early, Hernan Fellucci and Alejandro Damyan Panuko," the notification said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last sought death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life sentence in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in New York City in a federal case was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after a conspiracy conviction and espionage for the Soviet Union in the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an Uzbek national, showed no sense of remorse during the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that he had inspired himself to carry out the attack after watching ISIL videos on his phone, the indictment claimed.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be placed in his hospital room, the police told him.
He pleaded not guilty to the indictment, consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe the decision to seek a death sentence rather than to accept a conviction for guilty and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all affected," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to seek a death sentence.
Conservative MP says NAYJAL FARAGE has to lead Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people" today, during a protest at the Conservative Conference.
Former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should "sense the pressure" -- as one of the members of Theresa May's own party suggested he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonn, a Conservative MP, said in March in Birmingham that Britain "would have gone out by now" if Mr Farage had been Secretary for Brexit Affairs.
But the challenge Mrs May faced to deal with the party's deeply divided ranks was highlighted by conservatives supporting the stay who joined a separate protest against Brexit, in the city.
The prime minister tries to maintain his compromise plan "Chequers", despite attacks by supporting Brexit, supporting EU remains.
Allies insist that she will make progress in her attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and insist Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "haosa".
Mr. Bonn told protesters with the slogan "Getting Out Means Exit" in Solihull that he wanted to "s Dump Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr Farage had to participate equally with the others and that he had to obtain responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have left by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added, "I support Brexit, but we have to throw away the Chequers plan."
Announcing his opposition attitude toward the EU, he said: “We did not struggle in world wars to be servile.
We want to create our laws in our own country".
Mr. Bonn rejected allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The perception that the British had changed their minds and wanted to stay is entirely false."
Conservative representative Andrea Jenkins also participated in the rally, telling reporters: "I'm just saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists who actually went out on the street and actually helped us to be elected.
Please drop "Chequers" and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs May, she added, "Premiers keep their position when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said at the rally that politicians should "sense the pressure" if they intend to amend the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
"It is now about trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to amend Brexit and we are gathered here today to state "We will not let you get away with this".
In an address to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of changing to Brexit, feel the pressure.
"Mobilize the army of the people of this country that helped us defeat at Brexit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, supporting staying went on a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists had raised flags with inscriptions "Brexit Conservatives", following the band's launch this weekend.
The Labourist Lord Adonis mocked conservatives about the security issues of the party's application when it opened at the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can deploy the IT systems and all technology of Canada and more, and more, for unobstructed crossing of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren said he would "consider seriously" his candidacy for president
State Senator Elizabeth Warren announced she would "consider seriously the possibility of running for president" after the November election.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat Representative was talking about her future during a West Massachusetts City Council on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, would run for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Jeff Deale, who was a joint chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It is at the centre of speculation that it could take Trump's post in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the City Hall building after Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was high time "women went to Washington and repaired our damaged government, and that included women on top".
Arrested over Simms' death from LSU.
Baton Rouge Police, Los Angeles, announced Saturday that there was a suspect arrested in the Friday shooting when LSU basketball player Wade Simms was killed.
Baton Rouge police station reported Dayton Simpson's arrest, 20, during a press conference at 11:00 Eastern Time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen on the footage.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University area early Friday morning.
"Weid Simms was shot in the head, which eventually resulted in his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, had a gun, and shot Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested unharmed and detained in the custody of the East Baton Rouge Municipality Police Department.
A young man 6′6′′ who grew up in Baton Rouge – Simms was involved in 32 games with 10 outings as the starting man last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 struggles per game.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after his team's instructions helped defeat Sebastian Fettel
From the moment Walteri Botas qualified ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's instructions would have an important role in the race.
Bothas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two turns, enabling Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel first made a pit-stop and left Hamilton to deal with traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit-stop on the next lap and came out after Fettel, but Hamilton was able to overtake it after a daring maneuver and driving "tire to tyre", which forced Ferrari's driver reluctant to release the inside of the track to avoid penalty with added time after he had already closed his opponent's path with a dangerous double defensive maneuver on the third turn.
Top of his 21st birthday Max Verstapen started from the rear ranks of the starting grid and was seventh after the end of the first lap.
He then even led through a fairly long period of the race, as he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would have allowed him to be faster at the end of the race and eventually outpaced Kimi Raykonen in the battle for the fourth position.
He finally entered for a pit-stop on the 44th lap, but failed to catch up enough in the next eight laps and eventually Raykonen finished fourth.
It's been a tough day since Waltery did a great job all weekend and showed up as a real gentleman when he let me out ahead of him.
The team did an extraordinary job to win the first two seats on the podium," Hamilton said.
That really was a bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday because of her claim that she did not spread the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, which accused Supreme Court challenger Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a conversation at a West Virginia rally, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony to the Senate's legal committee, but instead commented on how what happened in the Senate showed that people were "evil and disgusting and insincere".
"What can happen is the good that happens the last few days in the Senate when you see the anger when you see angry people and evil, and disgusting, and insincere," he said.
"When you look at publications and distribution, and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
You know what I mean?
Diane Feinstein, has it spread from you?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document – "Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't distribute."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... no, we didn't distribute," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter with details of Ford's allegations against Cavanaugh as early as July, and it was spread earlier in September – but Feinstein denied this distribution happened from her office.
"I didn't cover Ford's claims, I didn't spread her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep privacy and I kept confidentiality as she wished."
But denial on her part was not well received by the president, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court challenger accused of sexual crimes against three women, the president argued that Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
See the disgrace, the shamelessness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to regain power and control," the President said according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars returned for the Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the Dundee rematch 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants led early in the game with two goals after strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boolier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney flattened for the hosts before Dwyer reinstated the Giants lead.
François Bouchard leveled for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals solidified their victory.
This is the third Elite League victory for Adam Keefe's boys who got out of the bottom to beat Dundy in Belfast 2-1 Friday night.
This was the fourth clash between opponents this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The blow with which Dwyer discovered the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with Kendall McFaul's assist, and then David Rutherford doubled the advance, assisting Boolier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Markartt helped level with Cowney's help at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break, scoring a second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard equaled the chances again with a powerful blow to the door at 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time this match at the end of the second half, with him giving everything he could and solidifying the team's win with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
The Giants, who lost the last four games of a total of five meetings, welcomed Milton Keynes as hosts for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller died to make sure hundreds of people on board an aircraft could escape an earthquake
A flight leader in Indonesia was praised as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers aboard was able to take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many were missing in a powerful earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, activating a tsunami wave.
Strong aftershocks continued to strike the area and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues had fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufrey Airport.
He had remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the track at the time, would be able to take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Control spokesman Indonesia, Johannes Syrate, said this decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia said.
We prepared a helicopter from Balipatan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency announced that access to Dongala, Sigi and Bhudong towns was limited.
"We suggest that the number of deaths will rise as many bodies are still under the debris, and many people cannot be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugrojo.
Waves that reached six metres devastated Palu, where a mass funeral took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings in more bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water.
There are marauders everywhere in minimarkets."
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the Indonesia International Red Cross Movement, pointed out to CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia struggles to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and turned to the country's army: "Please work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year Indonesia was decimated by earthquakes in Lombock, in which more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reported that one person is missing following a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, which flew a plane that crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific Ocean, now reported that one person had been reported missing after previously stating that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon, they could not contact one male passenger.
The airline added that they were working together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details of the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Local people's boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, authorities reported seven people were admitted to hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday, with everyone in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the United States Navy said the aircraft landed in the lagoon shortly before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had passed the runway.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claimed the plane had gone very low.
"This is extremely nice," Janes said.
Janes relates that he and the others managed to run through deep-to-cross water to reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming, as well as that he suffered a slight head injury.
The United States Navy reported that sailors repairing a dock nearby also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to fly people to shore before the aircraft sank into the deep about 30 metres of water (100 ft).
Data from the Safety Aviation Network indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have died in flights with airlines registered to PNG, but Air Niugini have not been involved in any case.
An analyst puts out the timeline of the night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution ended with its statement on the case this Saturday in the retrial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett of the United States Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlet said he had received location data from several mobile phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, back to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interview Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that "that's a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is that Tellis stated that he knew Chambers from two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlet pointed out that shortly after Chambers Tellis' death he deleted text messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He has wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin with its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be presented to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscientious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative opinions about the genre by performing his music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claimed that the hip-hop had strayed from its origins to political statements and engaged in social problems.
They want to return to its roots and re-populate the conscientious hip-hop.
Performers of the type of The Fugees and Common are revived in Britain through performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York nanny sues couple after dismissal for "racist" announcement
A New York nanny sued a couple for dismissal due to discrimination after receiving a mistaken message from the mother, who complained that she was "another black".
The couple denied being racist by incriminating the demand of "extortion".
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, was stunned when she realized that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, THE PREVIOUS BLACKKOW", wrote in a text message Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman of her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing her mistake, the "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the previous nanny, who was African-American, did not do the job well and that she was expecting Filipino, reported New York Post.
Mrs Morris received a one-day wage then sent home in a taxi.
Morris is now suing the couple for compensation due to the dismissal, demanding the amount of $350 a day for the six-month arrangement she was originally hired for, although she did not have a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't have to do this," she told Post on Friday, adding "You're sure it's discrimination."
In response to a request, the couple claimed not to be racist, adding that the cessation of Morris' employment was the reasonable action as they feared they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," husband Joel Plasco told Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you offended even if it was by mistake?
My newborn?
Think about it.
Incriminating the claim of "extortion", Plasco claimed that his wife had been born only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You're going to attack someone in this state?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit is still under consideration, public opinion quickly condemned the pair on social networks, condemning them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not feel a connection with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, born soon after the book was accepted by the audience, relates about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who first reads the book before it is published.
It's very funny now that we're aware of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC, before being inspired to write the children's book for a little bear toy, would feel optimistic about possible rejection of the book, adding that he welcomed the 60th anniversary of the book's publication "with mixed feelings", after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she described as "an important member of our family", she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
"He was a rather modest man and was not a boaster," she said.
"But since you felt Paddington so real, it's like having a child who has achieved something: you're proud of it, although it's not really your doing.
I think he kind of accepted Paddington's success like that.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was rushed urgently to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors struggled in vain to save her life.
"Over and over to say that the situation is really bad, that it does not expect to survive," Mrs. Edna-Laperuz said.
"Then Nad called me to say that he would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I told her, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The drugs given to her by doctors to maintain her heart slowly ceased and left her system.
She's gone a while before that, and that's how it's over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing this was all happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to pull it together."
Finally, Mrs. Edna-Laperuz, who has so far mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who have no idea of the test she is going through.
"No one understood," she said.
"I had bent my head and all the time my tears were falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this overwhelming sense of empathy with Over.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Grieving women put up postcards to prevent suicides from a bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Wales postcards with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, from Lidney, says her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everybody knew him by the smile.
They always said his smile shines every room."
However, he had given up his work before leaving, and was located in a "really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs Davis said, "I am constantly worried that this will have any consequences."
Mrs. Davis created the cards, "so people would know that there was someone to go to and who to talk to, even if that was a friend.
Do not remain silent – you must speak."
Mrs Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs Davis, lost Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when the children opened their gifts, he neither looked at them nor anything."
She said that it was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “This opens a gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must move forward and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future is in question after the FBI initiates an investigation.
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wanted – an investigation of limited duration and limited scope – perhaps we could join forces," Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee "was falling apart" despite a confirmed overparty blocking.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their aversion is because of the moment itself.
Early elections are in only five weeks, on November 6, if Republicans do not perform well, their attempts to elect their representative in the highest court in the state will seriously suffer.
George W. Bush called senators, inviting them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and with his help met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI drafts their report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where members are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Penns to declare a tie and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
The number of fugitives from North Korea "belows" at Kim
South Korean legislature claims the number of fugitives from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Soong, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, said there were 1127 fugitives last year, compared to in 2011, they were 2706.
According to Mr. Park, stricter border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts demanded by human smugglers, are key factors.
There is no official comment by Pyongyang.
Most of the fugitives from the North eventually obtained citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul stated that more than 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the illegal border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and is passed easier than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ), which divides the two Koreans.
China considers fugitives illegal migrants, not refugees, often forcing them to repatriate.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stagnation in nuclear disarmament talks.
This happened after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they basically worked for the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho blamed US sanctions for lack of progress since.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident of our national security and in these circumstances there is no way to disarm first unilaterally," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit for service at the Supreme Court
Congress minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh "histical" and said he was too unstable for a Supreme Court service.
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had reacted like this, they would have called her "hysteric," Pelosi said of her reaction to Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate legal committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected the allegations that he committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his inaugural speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost screaming and emotional when discussing his family and his school years.
He also categorically condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "a grotesque and coordinated attack on the personality", organised by Liberals who are unhappy that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi pointed out that, according to her, Cavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court as it had become clear that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these claims and with the way he pursues the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi denied when asked if she would attempt to discredit Kavanaugh if he were appointed and in case the Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will put it this way—if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is unfit not only to enter the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is in now," Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Cavanaugh's potential decrees regarding the Accessable Health Care Act or the Row v Wade case as he was considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would reject certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to enter the court and expect us to say, "isn't it great," Pelosi finished.
And women need to be mastered.
That's a legitimate criticism, after months and years of scattering rage, and she can't accept it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs Steinham told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on, "I got a huge help from a woman who was an executive somewhere who said that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she got angry and crying, she said to her interviewer, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just goes on.
I thought it was genius."
Tears are allowed in the expression of anger, partly because they are misunderstood at first.
One of my clearest memories of a previous job, in an office mostly with men, is how once, while I was sneezing with inexpressible rage, an older woman grabbed me by the neck – a chilling supervisor that I was always a little afraid of – and she dragged me to the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy that they did this to you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congressman from Colorado, was working with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship on a yacht called "Monkey Business", and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided there was no reason why he should not consider the idea of running for president herself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was another one to appear.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves".
As she joins the campaign late, she lags behind with fundraising and decides she will not stay in the race if she fails to raise US$2 million.
The battle is doomed to failure in advance.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would only give her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
During her speech, in which she stated that she would not continue with an official campaign, she was flooded with so many feelings – gratitude to the people who supported her, discontent with the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and to be able to turn to voters rather than delegates, as well as anger against sexism that she broke.
"One might think I've had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Shredder how the media reacted.
"Someone might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my headstone.
"She cried?"
How the US-China trade war can serve Beijing
The first shots in the US-China trade war were deafening and, while the battle was yet to pick up speed, a rift between the two countries would benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, launched the first warning volley this year by taxing key elements of China's exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tensions occurred this week with new duties affecting US$200 billion production ($150 billion) with an effective taxation of half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Each time Beijing responded with counter-renewable new duties with five to ten percent of U.S. goods for US$60 billion.
China vowed to respond to every US strike and soon the second largest global economy is not expected to ignore this.
To get Washington to give up means to succumb to demands, but to lower his head publicly to Washington would be too embarrassing for C. Jinpin, the President of China.
Yet, according to experts, if Beijing plays his cards right, pressure from the US trade war can help in the long term China with reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political solution in both Washington and Beijing could create conditions for an economic crisis in either country is actually more dangerous than the observers had previously recognised," said Abigail Grace, a research associate on issues related to Asia to the expert group Center for New American Security.
Syria "ready" for refugee return, Foreign Minister said
Syria has announced that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for assistance in rebuilding the country devastated by the war that lasted for over seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem pointed out that conditions in the state are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress we have in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists to bring them back to normal.
There are now all conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihood.
The UN estimated that more than 5.5 million Syrians had left the state since the beginning of the 2011 war.
Another six million people still living there need humanitarian aid.
Al-Mullem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in restoring the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries that financed the rebels would not be accepted.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the United States team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 to "Le Golf National" on the outskirts of Paris, France.
Thus, the United States has had six consecutive losses on European land and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the championship crown in the tournament after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the required 14.5 points that guaranteed victory over the United States.
The star of the United States, Phil Mikkelson, who performed poorly for most of the tournament, threw his first blow to the 16th hole (with a "par" 3) in the water with which he lost his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari performed well in all rounds, becoming one of four players in the history of the tournament, reaching a balance of 5-0-0 since the race took place in the current format after 1979.
American Jordan Spite lost by 5/94 of the player on the Europe team, located at the lowest in the rankings - Torbjorn Oles from Denmark.
World ranking leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, for whom this was probably the last participation of the Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight appearances at the Ryder Cup, became the European with the most earned points in the tournament of all time, increasing his asset to 25.5 points this year.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can raise the bowl again.
All that matters most is the team and I am happy to be able to help," said excited Garcia after Europe's victory.
He passed the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2&1 to the singles on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud of defeating Tiger Woods, yet I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and his total Ryder Cup balance was now 13-21-3.
Strange statistics about one of the greatest players of all time to win 14 major titles, an indicator that yields only to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team was having difficulties all weekend except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf in all days of the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furrick said after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At one time this morning, we pressed the team of Europe.
There was a fight.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players performed very well.
We will regroup, discuss the important issues with the United States Professional Golfers Association and our Ryder Cup Committee and look forward only.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can't help but take off your opponent's hat.
We were just outplayed."
