Where's your father?
This book isn't Tom's.
Be very careful with that.
I just wish I could speak French a little better.
What would you do if you were 10 years younger?

I heard Tom and Mary talking about it.
Why don't you put on a dress?
How do you feel about us these days?
Are there any more seats available?
I think you've done enough.
Tom unbuttoned his jacket.
Mary took a look at Tom.
There's something important I need to discuss with you.
Let's save it for another time.
What's the weather tomorrow?
I'll clean up.
She gave me a nice doll.
I haven't seen you since we were students.

Let's hope so.
He looked back at me and smiled.
Go get ready to go to bed.
It's not a weapon.
This coat is lined with leather.
I didn't know what I was giving up.
Speaking French is a lot of fun.
Have you actually tried?
Hey.
Those are Tom's dogs.
I'll give it to you for free.
You better not go.
Spring's late this year.
If you don't speak English, the probability of taking a good position is much smaller.
You haven't given me as much change as I should.
I might be able to find time to help you.
Tom found it.
Tom wasn't too busy.
It rained five days in a row.
His clothes always smell bad.
I have things to do.

Excuse me, how much is that?
It's time to think about your past.
Is he going to recover?
I'm starting to realize it's going to be impossible.
I've waited three days.
He had no idea when to start.
Wet clothes stick to the body.
I'm pretty busy.
Take this road, and when you get to a light, turn left.

I think Tom's doing well.
You don't understand.
I'm used to my parents ignoring me.

I'll keep that in mind.
Just close your eyes.
She kept the secret to herself.
Is that your pen?
He disappeared without a trace.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I think that's to be expected.
This book is in easy French.
I have to go now.
His wish finally came true.
Would you like to become a trusted user?
I'm getting confused.
Why should we help you?
I don't want to go out tonight.
They serve excellent food here.
Tom, where are you?
I'm studying French this afternoon.
I had a hard time solving this problem.
How long is this gonna take?

Please be patient.
Tom speaks French better than Mary.
Can you recommend some other hotels?
The rain prevented me from coming.
Ken calls me every day.
Our departure was postponed.

He gave me what I needed.
I missed you so much.
When I grow up, I'm gonna marry Tom.
That'll be a start.
How much sugar do you put on?
She seems to have a lot of girlfriends.
It wasn't serious.
Tom whispered Mary something in his ear.
You can't speak English, can you?
The trees began to cover with leaves.
Look at my fingers.
She speaks English well, but not as good as her brother.
I was really confused.
You did not eat of the cake I made; your sister ate.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't want to speak French today.
I think this is yours.
Stand up, please.
Who told you my name was Tom?
This is Tomovo.
I'll come too.
Can I open the window?

Speak out loud so everyone can hear you.
It's not our fault.

When was the last time you went to the beach?
Don't back down.

I wish Tom could be here today with us.
I'm in the house.
Do I have to open the window?
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
I have to get to the hospital.
Let me see that.
The news got us excited.
Are you cold?
I've never stolen anything from Tom.
I need you.
I like to listen to classical music.
I agree with his opinion.
Tom can speak French a little.
I'm sure Tom won't want to work late.
I was motivated.
I'll get a job.
Do I have the right to accompany you?
I couldn't find what you were looking for.
He rarely goes to church.
They get along well with their neighbors.
Tom didn't say anything about it?
French isn't that hard to learn.
I think you've done enough.
When did you start studying French?
I'll come to your place.
No one else offered to help.
Get your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I'll make you happy.
Let's play something.
What's your point?
If we just stopped trying to be happy, we'd have a pretty good time.
I forgot his name.
We're not in a hurry.
She's more shy than social.
I got to the station after the train left.
I've never seen a whale in person.
You want to wear my jacket?
I'm not going to ask him.

It's perfect.
I can't afford to buy it.
Where are we going?
I think we need to find out where Tom is.
I'd like to thank my parents, Tom and Mary.
Are you still happy?

We're always looking forward to Tom's annual visit.
There's no time.
You love kids, don't you?
I thought you didn't like Tom.
I think we need to find out who Tom's planning on giving it to.
Unbelievable!
That's all you can really do.
It's time we got a good-bye.
France borders Italy.
Simple numbers are like life, they are completely logical, but the rules for them cannot be found, even if you take all your time to think about them.

Can you recommend me some other hotels?
All you have to do is sweep the floor.
Have you seen my camera?
I haven't seen Tom in a while.
Show it to us.
There's nothing wrong with the plan.
Do good to those who hate you.
I'm going to finish this project.

The moon is made of cheese.
Their way of life is different from ours.
I don't want to keep you.
This meat is chicken.
I'm three years older than him.
I think it's okay.
What else is in your pocket?
There was nowhere else to go.
The man pushed her aside.
A hug from you will make me happy.
I can't believe you still trust Tom.
Please forgive me.
We waited with little anticipation.
I hear Boston was nice this time of year.
What's your nickname?

It's a beautiful drawing.
He didn't say anything that pissed her off.
That's too little.
I've never seen you here before.
Their coming here was a mistake.
He was injured in the crash.
The question now is "how."
I like to speak French.
There were widespread rumors of defeat.
It's very short.
Stop going back to your glorious days or you'll stay there.
I'm not tired at all.
What's the point of coming in time if everyone else is late?
The wind was blowing the rain right into my face.
I want eternal life.
Are you sure you want to hear this?
I think you'll be pleased.
That's not a problem.
Did you leave a tip?
Looks like nobody's home.
I'm going to have to decline this request.
So you're just not gonna do anything, are you?
What time is it?

I have to decide what my priorities are.
What's your father's name?
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
He's mad at you.
Tell Tom he can't go.
Christmas is coming up.
I intend to win.
A lot of the kids were almost naked.
Tom, I think we should help Mary.
They hired a moving firm to transfer their stuff to the new address.

Tom wasn't into it.
This guidebook might be of use to you on your journey.
Is your watch correct?
Give me another chance.
Ken wants a bike.
I like gardening.
They've been talking about coffee for over two hours.
It's an honor to be here.

I took the first step.
Watch where you're going.

I have to admit, I was worried.
You don't seem too happy to see me.
Can I open a can?
Learning a foreign language is an interesting thing to do.
Tom's a believer.
This is your book.
Sounds interesting.
I've prepared a list.
I'm not betting anymore.
It's my brother's.
This dress is worth the money.
Tom cuffed his shirt.
I don't remember sending the letter.
Why does he look angry?

It's okay.
Tom won't be at the bank at this hour.
I don't think you really want to do this.
You seem to have achieved considerable success since the last time I saw you.
The station is in the middle of town.
Don't even bother coming.
They're both unpredictable and impatient.
Me, too.
I don't like the way you're acting.
What are we doing here?
The subject is outside the scope of this investigation.
You're in my seat.
You're absolutely right.
You're impossible.
Tom said you'd come.
You have to be careful.
I think we're gonna need Tom's help.
What did you like?
It's gonna be okay.
I almost don't have French books.
Even though I'm old, you're still young.
Let's not forget Tom doesn't understand French.
I plan to go there.
A beautiful robin landed on the ledge of my room.

As I understand it, they'll agree with us.
You don't have to make up a reason if you don't want to come with us.
I saw her cleaning the room.
How are you today?
I'm really interested.
It's your book.
I overheard you talking to Tom.
That's one less problem.
Tom asked Mary to get toothpaste and toilet paper from the superis.
You have to work hard.
That hat doesn't fit me.
What's the minimum salary in South Africa?
He's on a diet because he's slightly overweight.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
You get a drink, you make your way with elbows to the buffet table, and you eat like a pig!
These technical terms are of Greek origin.
That's not Tom's problem.
Hold the rocket tight.
Going home, I saw her again.
Her hair is long.
I put it in your room.
I thought you were serious about Tom.
They won't bother you anymore.
I don't hate myself.
I don't give lessons.
Now it's your turn.
Do you love your mother?
I think you need a break.
Tom's being cheeky.
I think what Tom did was really stupid.
I wish I could speak French as a language bearer.
I'd like to open an account.
I heard you talking.
We became friends right away.
Tom spent the weekend at his beach house.
Black looks good on you.
You know all about me.
Give me a second to think about it, and I'll get back to you.
They're interesting people.
Please call me from time to time.
Tom checked his pants pockets.
Stick to the facts.
I wanted to talk to you about your grades.
No one was hurt.
It's not a literal translation, it's totally wrong.
I forgot your number.
How much wheat does this field give birth to?
I haven't seen you in three years.
Are you sure you want to know?
You can't stop him from drinking.
You're doing very well.
Good riddance, your curved path.
Can you give me a light?
He drinks his coffee clean every time.
I don't have any information about Tom.
She got a job as a typist.
Leave it to me.
They lied to you.
I have to go ask Tom.
You should have worked harder.
Her sweater is purple.
Now that I checked in, what am I supposed to do?
Clearly, Americans can't even solve their own problems, so how do they even think they're capable of dealing with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak clearly so that everyone can hear you.
I'm ticklish.
From now on, I'm going to study French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
It was so cold yesterday.
I forgot to give him the message.
I graduated from American literature in college.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
We were worried out of our minds.
I think you'll be pleased.
Teenagers quit.
I wish I were rich.
I've barely started.
If you need anything, just call.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
I've learned a lot.
She bought a toy for the kid.
I didn't get an answer from you, and I was wondering if my e-mail got to you at all.
She was brushing her hair in front of the mirror.
Tom tried to get his keys with his toes.
His teaching method is good and bad.
I heard Tom's story about what happened.
All I want is you.
I'm looking for a small suitcase.
He witnessed the murder.
I'm flying to Boston tomorrow.
He made it clear that he had nothing to do with it.
I love parties.
This is the chamber I bought yesterday.
Short skirts are out of style.
I think we're gonna need more time.
They're meeting at the hotel tomorrow.
Excuse me, how many are these?
Please repeat that one more time.
I think so.
A lot of museums don't work Monday.
They took Tom to the hospital to wash his stomach because he was eating something poisonous.
Don't make me do this.
You're sitting in my seat.
God forbid!
Green looks good on you.
I bet you know French.
For dinner, Tom took Mary to a restaurant on the beach.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
No matter how old you get, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sasayama?
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
What's the weather tomorrow?
Does he have any children?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
There's no way to hide that fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
Some say French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I like taking pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French wine?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom sat on a log.
The girls were dancing in the gym.
She is convinced that her son is still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
Finally, I stopped at the old house and saw the city again.
You won't see anything without a flashlight.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There are many ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit, I snore.
We've been using this insecticide for two years.
Come help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, that's too bad!
The bus arrived empty.
We need to keep helping Tom.
My mom's got a nice handwriting.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the meeting.
Tom cuffed his shirt and then put on his tie.
It's cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she's nice to everyone.
Ken plays football every day.
Come back anytime.
I don't want tea. I want coffee.
Lawyers and car mechanics are the people I trust the least.
Can you wait outside, please?
Can you eat raw oysters?
What prevented you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train traveled 500 miles in an hour.
She gave me this CD.
The director considered firing Tom, but decided not to.
I have to take it off.
Tom sat by the window.
I don't think you really want to do this.
For the most part, students were from the West Bank.
Is it possible that this is love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom has two children.
The police shouldn't take bribes.
I was in the mountains.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?
Travelers through southern Germany will see farms with solar panels wherever they look.
Don't look in the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone ring.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that no one said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I messed up your plans.
I'm going to ask you to translate this report into French.
No one's confused.
Everybody jumped.
Many merchants were robbed during the riots.
Why do I have to study French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We're grateful for your help.
Since we wear clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's get started.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom's lower than average height.
I found the key.
I know this is important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful blouse.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who are worried about you.
I don't have any pencils.
I don't really know Tom that well.
I'll tell you the truth now.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
For the last ten years, he's lived here.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Shit.
She calls me Kenji.
I have the information you asked for.
In a mysterious way, the sense of humor is related to national peculiarities.
Swimming is one of the things Tom likes to do.
He'll be back tomorrow.
He forgot to feed the dog.
I need to look into things.
I'll look at you.
I wanted to be an astrophysicist once.
Tom threw up blood.
This camera belongs to Tom.
I'm sick.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red tie.
You want me to turn it down a little bit?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me to do.
You can do it, go ahead, I'm with you.
Did he stop Mike from drinking?
Aren't you happy to see me?
I really couldn't have done it without you.
I'm not mad at you, I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to drive you home?
Did you and my younger sister leave at the same time?
The match was postponed for a while.
His brother's been studying a lot.
Ken has arrived in Kyoto.
Have you seen Tom?
I wish I was taller.
Do many people visit the museum?
Thieves robbed the museum.
He's crazy about you.
It comes from the inside to speak French.
Tom helped Mary put her coat on.
That kabuki book could be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this your book?
I've always wanted to study French.
Are you gonna call Tom, or do you want me to call Tom?
Don't be scared of Tom.
He leaned on his elbows.
What's the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's disgusting.
What's the minimum salary in New Zealand?
I'm dealing with him for the price.
You can speak French, can't you?
My father smokes rarely.
His vain attempts to seduce her, showed him that he had the wrong address; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're soul mates.
The boss is very upset.
That doesn't change anything.
I'm meeting him at noon.
The invitation said there'd be popcorn and soft drinks.
Tom looks pale.
I hope this helps.
What did you find out?
I think we should get out of here.
I've worked with Tom for a long time.
He's much older than Ken.
Where are the showers?
Mike ran real fast yesterday.
Do you have a European Health Insurance Card?
None of the balls are yellow.
I know someone you should meet.
I was rude.
Kuala Lumpur is worth a visit.
I couldn't make them understand me.
You speak French too?
Just recently, I started learning French, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get a response from Mary.
A boy no older than five years asked Tom how to get to the post office.
Tom still lives with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's asleep.
Are those explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
Anne doesn't have any sisters.
Tom's got small hands.
He arrived two days earlier.
Was it a good trip?
He made me a suit.
Men make houses, women make homes.
Where's the bathroom?
They usually come home before us.
I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I won't be able to carry Tom over the bridge.
If I were you, I'd apply for this job.
The patient was discharged from the hospital.
My Internet is slow.
We have to keep working.
Hurry up, we're gonna be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was fascinated by her opera singing.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's with Tom now?
His concert was very good.
Another crowd of tourists arrived.
The door clicked and closed.
I'm hungry!
It's easy to talk to Tom.
The twins are totally alike.
Don't hang out with Tom.
I didn't get the joke.
I bet you know that.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to go with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Could you repeat that, please?
How much money do you have?
And I was sick.
I have some very bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Considering how long I've been studying French, I should be able to speak better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
You want to buy a shirt?
I think you have the right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to attend Mary's party.
You won't be the only one there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happily.
I'm angry at myself.
This was done by Tom himself.
You wouldn't believe the things people throw away.
I stopped smoking for a year.
Don't carry much luggage when you're traveling.
I have Tom's picture here.
I haven't told you everything.
They're both functioning.
Tom's not welcome here.
He accused her of lying to him.
There's no point in fooling yourself, you know she's playing games with you.
George is very enthusiastic about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He needs to be given an advantage over the others.
I tricked you.
Take him with you.
Hold on a second.
I swim once a week.
I waited an hour and a half.
He made a public mockery of me.
The light's out.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Lower it.
How about we have dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
This is the photo I took at Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I've never spoken to Tom in French.
We all assumed that Tom could speak French.
Tom's back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You're not gonna believe this.
I'm looking for a house.
I don't feel well.
Why are you early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a night bird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, don't you?
Do whatever you want; but I will hinder him if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I need to trust Tom.
I think I'll learn to swim during the vacation.
Which way is the beach?
Are the Giants playing tonight?
I feel like he's not gonna let me freak out so easily.
It'll be 5:30 in a minute.
The school starts at eight and a half.
Tom's taking a bath.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken jumped the wall.
The upper part of the mountain is covered in snow.
A hug from you will make me happy.
When are you leaving?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
There's a really good restaurant right by the beach that I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the image.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I completely erased you from my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
Are you thinking French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What's the minimum wage in Lithuania?
Here's the hospital I was born in.
He who sows winds will reap storms.
According to the last census, the total population of the country is just over 7 million.
Temporary measures will have no effect on drug dependence.
I don't know where I left the keys.
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Sentenced to death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I don't have anything.
For once, think with your head.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of a new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
I'm thinking about it.
Don't you have anything else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you answer it?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We had to obey their request.
Pick the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so go to bed early.
That was stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I have nothing to offer.
I'm talking to my employees in French.
It's a picture of my sister.
Tom's hard to deal with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her some advice.
The room was so smoked, I couldn't breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He certainly loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
She doesn't seem to be feeling very well.
Did Spot go, too?
I promise I'll bring him back.
I have family in Boston.
Get out of here!
Tom's wearing a coat.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I need to go talk to Tom.
What do you say we study together in the library?
I have work to do.
The job offer is still in place.
Your shirt's missing a button.
I have to go out for a while.
Green looks good on you.
Keep your fingers crossed.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see this one?
Uncle gave me this watch.
True friendship is forever.
Tom's used to working outdoors.
Tom pulled the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
You're kidding me.
Let's go back.
I'm getting on the bus.
Tom learns French every day.
They're in this shop with kitchen supplies.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You're supposed to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works at that bakery is nice.
Please pour me another cup of coffee.
Alice might be coming.
How do you do that?
I had a good time.
I'll stay the day after tomorrow.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Does anyone on your team speak French?
Looks like it's gonna start snowing.
I've never seen anything like it.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never been to Mount Fuji.
You don't play golf, do you?
Tom doesn't work anymore.
It's probably nothing important.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumped.
What's the minimum wage in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has sparked heated debates.
Eat a live frog every morning, and for the rest of the day nothing worse will happen to you.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
Unemployment is growing.
I couldn't sleep last night.
Russia lost 20 million people during World War II.
I never meant to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy's smiling.
If you're going to France, you need to refresh your French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
We go to French school.
That's what he said.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I won't be able to tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please have patience.
Your joke goes too far.
I had a really good time today.
Christopher Columbus drank unfiltered seawater.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need this.
They're all hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseball player.
Tom still wanted to be single.
I have three children.
Let me sleep for ten more minutes.
Uncle gave me the watch.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
Last week I had pizza every day.
I promise I'll bring it back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
You must be mistaken.
His daughter has become a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, he's writing something.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I opened a check account.
He was here at the time.
I put my shoes on right away.
He felt uncomfortable in his father's presence.
Your shoes are untied.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took off his coat.
I can swim in the river.
Do you do French every day?
Don't make so much noise, please.
You're pretty good at French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one considered his words important.
That's a weird problem.
I don't understand that.
What place do you live in?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time for lunch.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got an A.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They're playing basketball after school.
Those clothes look good on you.
I couldn't say no.
That's surprising.
I heard someone come in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they take a bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something in person with you.
He was transported to the hospital by helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
I'm sewing my shirt.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's engaged to Jack.
Good luck to you.
He was home alone.
In Esperanto, nouns end in "o". Multiple is formed by adding "j".
Tom wants to be a doctor when he grows up.
Don't I get a hug?
I'm older than any other student in my class.
I buy tapes.
We're gonna need Tom's help.
How tall is your brother?
Come visit us.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Jane's in serious trouble.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't showered in three days.
Triangles don't have four angles.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What's the minimum wage in Romania?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you gonna get home?
I wash my clothes.
I've heard French is a tough language.
I haven't really eaten.
Soon you'll stop thinking about her.
Let me take a look.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big firm.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Go upstairs and go to bed.
Come on, touch him.
It's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years did you study French?
Carol went back to her hotel.
Do you like this color?
Please be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered in snow.
Let's get out of here.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
He got off the train.
Mary's dating two at the same time.
There's still no sign of Tom.
Give it to me.
Did you manage to do everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was woken up at five o'clock.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can contact the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What do you want to tell me?
I'm looking for something not so expensive.
It's much easier for Tom to speak English than French.
I think you'd be surprised.
Next time, I'll try harder.
I've done my job already.
He's a hero.
I don't have any requirements.
Her charm is a mixture of joy and kindness.
I should have listened to you.
I have brown hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
We're almost there.
I like that color.
My grandmother was operated in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you and Tom.
I don't think that's true.
I've got three cameras.
Ask for Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I have a chance to return the favor.
Tom went through the drawer to see if there was any pen I could use.
This requires careful consideration.
Tom won't believe it.
I need to know the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We ran after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I were young.
Be more specific.
Tom's French is really good.
Isn't the weather great?
I'm not uncomfortable with that.
I don't want to belong to the elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You have to study hard.
I'll be back soon.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom explained things in detail.
Don't let Tom get away with it.
He played football with an empty can.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm on vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You better put a sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process has achieved good results.
That's what his ignorance is all about.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French is not good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are they criminals?
Can you take six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll throw him a farewell party.
What club are you in?
Atsushie may have been sick.
Tom didn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth rereading over and over again.
We're working together now.
Go back to your seat.
He has graduated from Cambridge with honors.
I have to get it back tonight.
I have to start getting ready.
Does Tom study French at school?
Which shoes do they fit?
We've definitely worked hard.
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it warms up.
He's starting to make excuses.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do this.
How old are your kids?
I'll stay until tomorrow.
Please call a doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You don't know half of it.
This is the photo I took at Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat herself.
I'm starving!
I'll help you get better at this.
My dad goes running every morning.
I saw Tom walking on the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't get up too fast.
She gave away all her dolls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Go away.
It's a big city.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim is dressed very attractive.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.
It's okay to create a webpage, just be careful not to violate someone's copyright.
Tom defended his wife.
She's got a lovely handwriting.
The fingers of the hand are five: thumb, forefinger, middle finger, nameless and pinky.
The foil is made of polyethylene.
I solved the problem with ease.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
How much does a cab get out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is this yours, Tom?
I don't have many English books.
We have until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
Enthusiastic began his respectable venture.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, the local cowboys laughed at him.
He seems to be in a hole.
I think you should come and see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary does.
Be more specific.
I'm on leave this week.
I'm washing my socks.
I promise I won't do that again.
I just gave blood.
He doesn't know French or German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
I have no doubt of his sincerity.
Please open the package.
It's on me.
I have no idea who he is.
Could you tell me your name, please?
This kind of mistake is inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Did you watch the game?
This is your home.
The losses were heavy on both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I'd like something warm to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary it was time for them to leave.
She puts on makeup every morning.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Do you prefer to speak French?
Wow, that's cool.
Don't give me a good look.
I don't have any money.
Millie's eating bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't do this without you.
Tom's not used to living in the city.
Keep Tom in check.
Jane went shopping.
This cake is good.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
Long skirts are now out of date.
He's doing very well with children.
Come in, please.
We were really having fun.
Tom hates that.
It's true she's dead.
Don't make a habit of it.
It finally stopped snowing and the weather warmed up.
She made not too slight hints about what she wanted for Christmas.
Students didn't remember what they read in this book.
I study French every day.
I've heard every word.
Where'd you take your socks off?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons used properly are useful.
What are we gonna eat?
Keep it a secret.
You're making me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her vocabulary.
He's three years older than her.
Don't get your hopes up.
What's the price of this umbrella?
Mom, can you pass me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you've changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to study French.
I'm not good at sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to make it.
I found out he's a genius of chemistry.
You can't just walk around here and there, start slandering people.
I had a meeting at 2:30, but I got stuck in traffic and couldn't get there in time.
They went to the sea museum.
Tom is making a lot of efforts to improve his French.
A lot of time was lost in vain.
They didn't talk.
I didn't call you a fool.
I'd like to speak French today.
You want to tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it personally.
We're all connected.
A word of support when you fail costs more than an hour of praise when you have succeeded.
Are you sure you don't want me to drive you home?
It was finished.
His shirt was covered in sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You won't be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a fur coat.
I promise I won't do it again.
I made Anne a doll.
What did you graduate from, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
It's a very interesting story for me.
I've read this book.
That was a good year for you.
It's been cleaned.
I can't do that.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom a present.
One thing's for sure, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I've been convicted.
Tom's been told recently that he has cancer.
Tom came home by bus.
For me, a meeting this afternoon is a better option.
What do you have to do?
Tom studied French for three hours last night.
Raise your hand.
What's that?
It was too easy.
I travel a lot.
Here's the hospital I was born in.
I never liked biology.
I owe you a lot for your kindness.
Let's split the prize fifty-fifty.
Shake my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think you'd better lie down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
I need to know.
Do you like to travel?
Your plan failed.
Tom had a big party at his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced out of school.
I just finished breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long are you gonna have to wait?
Tom's the guy who told me when the meeting was gonna be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers started coming home.
I have a problem, I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?

Do you feel guilty?
You think?
He learned to swim.
You really can't swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too short.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
I'm getting puss from the gums.
I can't do it alone.
I hope you're right.
If you tell her about it, then she'll tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell their best friends and eventually everyone will understand.
She was cold.
Tom speaks French.
I've never seen a rainbow.
Ken can swim, right?
Tom and Mary went to the amusement park.
I thought it best not to say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Are you watching carefully?
A few minutes later, the phone rang.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door, please.
Tom's finally gone.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
That's the cutest puppy I've ever seen.

Tom wants more money.
Is this your family?
It's been a terrible day.

I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why did you run away?
What's your favorite bird?
You can study here.
Let me help you.
You wish.
I'm afraid I've offended you.
I have nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's devoid of experience.
I didn't know you were cooking.

Let go of me.
You're cute, and you're sweet.

I think you should make the deal.
That was not my intention.
I need to get out of here for a while.
She loves the color of her shirt.
Hey, man, please spray some insecticide behind the fridge.
She accused me of not answering the letter.

Every human being is part of the whole of the universe we call the Universe, a part limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of its consciousness. This illusion is a kind of prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and the attachment to our nearest people. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison, expanding the circle of our compassion, so as to encompass all living beings and nature in all and beauty.

I've never met Tom before.
I called him in yesterday.
Let's take a break here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we're interested in Tom.
I'll take the next bus.
Tom's twice as old as Mary.
Mary has two boyfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not that tired.
You have a wreath infection.
He started writing a novel.
He's satisfied with the result.
Hurry up and you'll be able to catch your train.
You won't be needing this anymore.
Put it back where you got it.
Let's get started.
I screwed you.
Tom found Mary stealing from the cash register.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it after all.
Can you do it yourself?
She's blushing.
You think I'm that stupid?
If you give someone 20 bucks and you never see him again, it was probably worth it.
That's Jane's purse.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum wage in India?
Don't make a decision on this today.
She didn't have much money.
You're in my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
Do you study French?
You don't have to give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What's Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
We're going to college next year.
What did you eat, fish or meat?
I made a check.
I thought Tom had the day off.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There's a lot of sentences about DNA, but there's not one about RNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to that.
Don't pick your nose.
The wind was blowing.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her eldest daughter is married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his classmates.
Of twenty students, only one has read the book.
I have work on Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese tend to trust established authority.
I came home on the train.
I think I can do it in my spare time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
What situation would you do that in?
What was the name of the guy you used to date before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
I'm really tired and I want to go to bed early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philologist.
She lives in New York.
He must be the principal of the school.
I bet I'll get there before you do.
He was painted as a clown.
I'm uncomfortable in her presence.
She bought him a dog, but he had an allergy to dogs and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
There was no TV or radio in those days.
She went to the museum in a taxi.
Mind your own business!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These socks have holes on their heels.
Tom likes to knit.
You're a good doctor.
Don't ever say that word again.
I saw him stop.
She felt her knees shaking.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him some other time.
She wasn't that strong.
What a strong wind!
That's my CD, right?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's dating the group of kids he shouldn't be dating.
It'd be good if you didn't mess with personal affairs.
Do you have to go to the post office?
My gums bleed every time I use a dental floss.
We got here fast because the traffic wasn't loaded.
You have to be careful.
What do you miss?
He has recently returned from France.
Molly's got a big watch.
Tom's not helping me.
I haven't been in touch with him in a long time.
Those glasses look good on you.
What did you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
Don't eat until the perception passes.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's watching a dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom's not helping us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is French harder than English?
This pair of shoes doesn't fit me.
Are you afraid of something?
I have two cousins.
Leaves fall in the fall.
Aren't you going to do anything?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the meeting.
Since when does Toim learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
I'm a little sick.
I'm so ashamed.
Looks like there's over 2,000 Uighur sentences in Tatoeba already!
Tom's stubborn.
We can't postpone the reunion.
I'm ashamed I did that.
Let's cross over here.
I know this is hard.
Are you a exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
Are you thinking of going to Tokyo tomorrow?
I hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true Tom and Mary were arrested?
If mankind does not care about the environment, the environment will destroy mankind.
No, thanks, I'm just looking.
I felt like I was being rejected among these people.
I think you're gonna have a good time tonight.
Don't bring him in yet.
Sorry to interrupt.
Being too generous is his biggest flaw.
Press Shift button.
You understand, don't you?
Jane always acted like she was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know that.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It doesn't cost anything.
I don't mind the hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new business cards.
I'm thirsty.
Flowers fade without water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you Tom can't swim.
I forgot.
The bill, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Guess what he told me.
We're out of salt.
She forgot to feed her dog.
That's not the problem.
Go meet him, and in the meantime, drop this letter.
This chicken hasn't laid a single egg lately.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
Dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Let me finish, please.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life at school is going well.
Mrs. Jung didn't mind me visiting her unexpectedly.
You have nice lips.
Many people will lose their jobs because of the shrinking of the car industry.
He came to my rescue.
We'll start landing in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
We're running out of food.
The moment of fame for Hanshin did not last long, they were quickly shifted from the first place.
Is there a big house?
Won't that lead to problems?
He resented being called a fool.
Their condition is getting worse.
Do you really want this?
Will he fail the exam?
I can't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What conclusions did they come to?
Here we are at last!
I'm taller than you.
I consider myself lucky.
Tom could have lied.
I feel good.
She pushed the button.
I didn't feel well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
We need to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put the pie on the ledge of the kitchen window to get cold.
Happy is that man who married a good woman.
Tom gave me good advice.
He's always telling the truth.
I can't live like this anymore.
Ah, what a pity!
Say hello to Jimmy.
Does it taste good?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't make me shoot you.
The equator divides the Earth globe into two hemispheres.
It was personal.
Aren't you interested?
It's a great pleasure to see baseball games.
I think you should get some rest.
When did you start learning French?
She was brushing her hair in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it's gonna rain today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where did you throw them?
How's Tom going to deal with the problem?
The thief got away with the money.
I've never talked to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is the picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This is Tom's camera, isn't it?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than her.
My uncle gave me the watch.
Please excuse me for being late.
I felt isolated.
I'm pretty busy.
They're pretty important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Let's try this sweater.
I'd better stay home.
That's not very funny.
The phone is something you can't do without.
I contacted them a few days ago, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My dad drives very well.
We have to protect our children.
See you later.
I'm completely exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistically.
I heard you encourage them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister was.
In the summer, I plan to go to France.
Please stir the cards carefully.
Get on the bus to Badstrasse and get off on Zeestrase.
Laughter is good for your health!
This isn't a mistake.
I guess you're the Tom everyone told me about.
Add this site to "Prefered".
When the sun of culture is low, even dwarves cast a great shadow.
When is the museum open?
I've seen you somewhere.
He sat on his bench.
We just cleaned the toilets.
Tom and I have a meeting at the mall.
I won't give in to the threats.
You're in better shape than I am.
Are you ticklish?
I hope it's helpful.
He tried it himself.
I'm with the FBI.
Tom works for me.
He's up late.
Tom's getting better.
I walk like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch your step.
Can I take your knife?
You have to hand over the report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you'd told me that earlier.
Don't look at the camera.
It's raining, but we're going anyway.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't listen to my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret this.
I thought Tom was gonna cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want to eat something.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister was.
We're like brothers.
I can't even put the water to boil, let alone roast a turkey.
What's the name of this river?
Is she available for you tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
In winter, the roads are covered with ice.
We barely have time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm an adult now.
I want to go.
Bring her back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want an orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom speaks French like a Frenchman.
I think we should make a deal.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket box?
I'm really busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you're gonna need this.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Bring me something to drink.
Am I going to die?
I got a little carried away while I was dancing, and I went up to the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this into pounds.
I think Tom lied to us.
I wish Tom would smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and rest for a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was shaking down the bumpy road.
Tom has a right to know.
The wind is yours.
She passed her exam.
I'm going to study at the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do that?
I've met him before.
Tom never gave up.
Tom's not in trouble.
I made a few mistakes on the exam.
This book is not Tom's property.
Where was that?
I have to get it off.
Is there anything I can do to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work in a hospital.
Tom's a grown man now.
Let's not lie to each other.
I'm getting better.
It's not art, it's a vagina with teeth.
I never saw you.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so cooperative.
Have you heard of him?
She washed the shirt in a hurry.
Is anyone with you?
The museum is open to visitors.
Does Tom really want to win?
My grandfather loves to read.
Did you know you wore different socks?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, honey.
Tom had only one wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary Friday night, and with Alice Saturday night.
Looks like it's going to rain.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary does.
You can't read French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
Letter paper.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I don't hear anything.
We'd better make sure.
I can't help you.
He came out from under the car.
He writes to his mother from time to time
Men get in shape, riding a bike.
This isn't the end of the story yet.
Take your time.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's take a break under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Get me a dry towel.
Jim's name is James.
Are there any other hotels you can recommend me to?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding me.
More tests are needed.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there a similar expression in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Anne's a little girl.
Just keep your fingers crossed.
I'm on my way to the park.
I like to play basketball.
The train arrived ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep province.
I'm sorry.
I don't waste ammunition.
You're my best friend.
I set up a meeting.
I haven't told anyone about us.
That was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French poems?
Ken wasn't running.
I paid the video in five installments.
I just want to hang out with you.
She turned twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What could that mean?
They come from Sweden.
Watch out when you cross a busy street!
A man has to work.
That's intriguing.
What's your nationality?
That part's good.
Merry Christmas!
Come down here.
Mary's running.
They long for urban life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog was walking around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It happened between 8:00 and 10:00.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came running with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom gave up too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary discuss it.
Let's eat sushi.
Throw those socks away, please.
Please be more careful in the future.
Tom was overwhelmed by a panic attack.
Can I open a can?
He was a baseball player.
Don't say such things.
He came after you left.
Did you eat breakfast?
The room is fully furnished.
I admire your courage.
I'll check upstairs.
Tom's in first class.
Don't stay out too late.
I'm taking the day off tomorrow.
Nor did I say that.
It's better to give than to take.
Can you take this, please?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you solve this problem?
I think you've had enough.
You've told me this before.
It's been six years since I started learning English.
I can't buy you this dress.
I work as a bee.
Brian made Kate wait for him.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed Tom doesn't usually lock his door.
Can you help me translate this?
Tom barely understands French.
It's the same hospital where Tom works.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to be a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This air conditioner spends a lot of electricity.
Don't fall for this subtle propaganda.
Tom thinks the death penalty should be overturned.
First the good God made the Man, and then he made the Woman, and then he took pity on the Man, and gave him the tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Boys, don't make any noise.
Don't look them in the eye.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
Does this look familiar to you?
Get your coat.
What money do you have?
It won't change anything.
The building is almost complete.
I thought they were unemployed.
I better get to work.
Aoi's dancing.
Today, machines can do a lot of things for people.
He went for a walk.
Please start now.
I've seen your driver's license.
Where's my room?
Tom is suffering from a flat step.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Human stupidity is infinite," I say, and because of its self-criticity, I consider myself an exception.
The storm wouldn't stop, on the contrary, it was getting stronger.
Tom had Mary translate the letter into French.
The unemployment rate is still high.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Is that what Tom would want?
The whole road's going uphill.
Aren't you ashamed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I wish things were back to the way they were.
Show me.
Tom got a tooth out last week.
The more you run, the more you get tired.
Don't cover up how you feel about that.
Is there something for me?
Can you open the door for me?
The girl's Irish.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom is often ill.
The key doesn't fit the lock.
What's the minimum salary in Italy?

That's my bike.
I'm not used to eating spicy.
Pick what you like.
Go over there and talk to her.
We met at a summer camp.
Don't talk in the classroom.
That's not from me.
When my dad found out I was dating Nimrod Nick, he got really pissed.
The teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we were having breakfast together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find it's Tom's fault.
She put on her sweater.
Sometimes I run out of money.
Don't worry, Mr. President: with such bad gums, she hardly even has teeth.
I've never seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a cozy little house.
Go back to bed.
Why didn't you try on the dress before you bought it?
Tom killed himself jumping off a cliff.
Where were you born?
These clothes look good on you.
They headed straight for their destination.
The boy came in through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
The bill, please.
I thought you'd be happy.
Are you finished with dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his grandfather's violin.
Do what you think is right.
Are you falling in love with Tom?
Persistence pays off.
They arrived separately.
To speak French is fun.
Tom's not gonna make it.
Prepare for the worst.
I believe Earth is being watched by alien intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think there's been a mistake.
My dad's walking in the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each of them a pencil.
Don't rush me.
I think you should grow a beard.
Do you like French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another soda?
A lot of people share my view on this.
Blouse's clean.
Some tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He finished his big venture at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't need to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
The child is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be set on fire.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Sort the words alphabetically.
Tom can speak French a lot smoother than me.
I'm gonna hide in here.
She took care of her sick husband.
He was playing while he was walking.
I saw the girl in the crowd.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English, let alone German.

I opened the door and kept it open for Mary.
We make cheese and butter from milk.
How many One Piece episodes have you seen?
I haven't really thought about it.
I'm off this week.
If a sick woman folds a thousand paper cranes, her wish will come true.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I don't owe you anything!
The bus driver didn't see the pedestrian.
Why did you leave?
I want my shirt back.
I spent my vacation in Hacone.
Take a look at these papers.
I'd like to translate that into French.
He didn't say a word.
They drink tea in the living room.
Tom started the engine.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk.
Boil 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that enough for you?
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Your bike is better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to go with you?
Be careful.
How do I get to the airport?
Who pulled it?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're boys.
Bad weather prevented us from leaving.
I'm studying French now.
Because I didn't know where to get off, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm so busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Be there tonight.
You're on a winning streak.
I can't be mad at you for this.
The broadcast of television has greatly deprived us of our reading time.
It'll take me forever to explain everything.
Don't peek in my closet.
The new coronavirus is very contagious.
Every time I look for you, you're gone.
You get off at the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm here unofficially.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't be here till 2:30?
Tom taught me how to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and toast.
I have to fix this.
I made breakfast.
He follows English literature.
It's a stupid knife.
She gave me a big look.
It's forbidden to smoke in school buildings.
I'm really tired and I want to go to bed early.
I love you more than anything.
Why are you here so early?
Some people know how to talk well, and some people are good listeners.
I didn't understand the last word.
As rich as she is, she's not happy.
Go and see for yourself.
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
You can meet him.
Close your books.
I heard someone's coming in.
Tom went his father's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom approached me in French.
He can also speak Russian.
Japan has many distinctive features.
Do you believe there is a god?
I walk around with the dog at night.
What's your blood type?
Ten houses burned down.
I should never have let you do this alone.
Condemned to death.
I've only been waiting five minutes.
Can you show me your photo album, please?
Tom's house burned down.
The greatest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How much does your daughter weigh?
Tom shouldn't have done that.
I'm an atheist.
I never write the words "borscht" and "shchi" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom's knees are shaking.
I'll go back to the hotel with you.
Give me some milk, too.
I think she's over forty.
Do you have your driver's license?
I don't need your help.
He's at the door.
My business is revived again.
The keys are on the table.
I headed for the park.
He reported the accident to the police.
I don't see him.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid we can't talk about promotion now.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you afraid?
I didn't talk to anyone today except Tom.
I can barely hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you turn off the light?
He drinks an average amount of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's gone.
You're wearing your socks upside down.
We just got reports from Kansas regarding your brother.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Is this new model on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
What's this all about?
Watch out for Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 yen a month.
You're in the way.
She got the ticket without giving anything.
A lot of people think retro cars are pretty expensive.
The GNP for the third quarter exceeded 1% of the previous quarter.

Can you even see anything out there?
Everyone was at work.
I'm out of gas.
Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it the way you told me to.
Which floor do you live on?
Tom was on my bus.
I waited a month.
I have to go meet Tom.
He was forced to sign the contract.
Not so much the disease knocked him down as the laziness.
Aren't you scared, Tom?
Allah is great!
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the film, she's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to study in my house?
Go back to bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
My dog's watching TV, too.
Let's get to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not crazy.
He watches TV sometimes.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
Hurry up, there's only 30 minutes left until the train leaves.
Participants prepare for the final round of the race.
I have plans for Saturday night.
I feel like I'm tired.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Coming here was a mistake.
Don't be so hard on us.
Her hobby is to collect postage stamps.
I don't understand German.
I think you'll like it there.
I'll be okay.
Tom won't know anything about this.
Don't forget to bring your kitchen kits like knives and cookware.
We're here.
Where are you going?
We're going to the beach.
I promised myself I'd never do it again.
Jane sometimes runs to school.
I think you're gonna like this.
I could make you happy.
Every student has a locker.
Have you seen the koala?
Tom couldn't believe that Mary really loved him.
I can't buy you that dress.
I think you panicked.
He went for a walk.
I hope you're right.
No less than 100 people attended the meeting.
I know you're right.
My vacation plans have failed.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
He came to Tokyo and there he married her.
I don't think that's true.
I lost track of time.
He thought it might be a trick.
Basho is the greatest poet.
What's your problem?
I'm going to visit my grandmother at the hospital.
Hell is a place where it smells bad and no one loves anyone.

Where's the bathroom?
I have to report this.
You're pretty good with French, aren't you?
He canceled the party.

Bring me my magazines.
She tied him to the chair.
I'm young.
It's a big city.
He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone.
Are you in debt yet?

You're cruel.
Tom remains firm.
The problem seems much more complicated.
I'm drinking water.
Don't worry.
Tom hasn't been well lately.
I have to tell you something first.
One coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have another choice?
He's alone.
In China, we put the last name first, and then the name.
Give it to him.
The boy palely reminded his father of appearance.
He always manages to write to his mother at least once a week.
He looked me right in the eye.

Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm very happy.
You shouldn't say things like that when there are kids around.
It's easy to put on.
I want to improve my French pronunciation.
You're not gonna believe what I heard.
I'm gonna study Tom.
Today, the train is ten minutes late.
There was silence.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?
She didn't like him.
You study French, don't you?
I have to go on a date.
I hope we find Tom.
Although I know a little French, I think we should speak English.
She's getting prettier and prettier.
What are you doing this weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
The drawer won't open.
Try to calm down.
We need to run a test on the exam date.
Maybe we're missing the obvious.

He'll get to Hakodate tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
You have to work hard.
Hello!
They eat apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
I've been very volatile lately. My favorite football team is going down.

Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what you saw that night.
I studied French for three years with a language bearer.
That's not my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there while it's still light.
Tom hurt himself.
His room is a mess.
They take some of their spare time to take care of the sick.
Are you sure you don't want us to go with you?

Ask Tom.
Turn on the radio.
I'll stay three more days.

You'd better put a sweater under your jacket.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How complicated is that?
I heard you laughing.
I completely erased it from my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't go into the museum, it's in reconstruction right now.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to.
I didn't mean to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom swims really fast.
Add this site to "Prefered".
I have a lot to say about this.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
This concerns you.
The worst part is, it wasn't always like this.

I play in a band.
The birds sang.

You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Did you go to the beach with Tom?
I care.
Have you heard Tom speak French?
Beautiful sunset, isn't it?
You really speak French quite well.
Say hi to Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should choose Tom.
Something's happening.
Do I make myself clear?
Many parents worry that their children do not receive basic knowledge of numbers.
I graduated philosophy at my university.
Which beach do you like to go to?
You can always give some of the job to junior employees.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.

Is something scaring you?
Everyone agrees with you.
Tom encouraged me to study French.
I want an MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I'm shaking myself thinking about it.
I paid two hundred dollars in taxes.
I think you should check under the bed.
It won't happen again.
I did it for you.
Stop it or I'll let you know.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another engagement.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is this?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I have no intention of giving up this watch for a while, and not to mention finally breaking up with it.
He didn't get the job.
I think you'll do great.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we have enough food.
I'll be on the next bus.
Mary made egg sandwiches.
What did you see?
In summer, I bathe every morning.
Close your shirt.
Read it again.
I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I didn't get there in time for his speech.
I prefer grapefruit to oranges.
This place is worth a visit at least once.
He kept reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just accept it.
Her sister ironed her shirt.
I've told you this before, haven't I?
Why do you keep saying there's plenty of time?
I'll visit you tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or your silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like an orange juice.
From the moment I took your book, until I left it, I'd roll all the time laughing, and one day I'm gonna start reading it.
I tried to argue with Tom.
The fighter's up for the round.
I've seen that, too.

Both Tom and Mary covered their eyes.
That's my baby.
I'll provide you with all the information you need.
Stop whining.
You can't just walk around and slander people.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insured.
I'm borrowing money.
She's getting ready for college.
I think you're really amazing.
It seems all Tom wants is money.
I'm not going with you.

She gave me a nice present.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of kings.
I have no intention of apologizing to Tom.
What do you do?
I read all Milton's work during the vacation.
What do you recommend?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Each student was asked one question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.

I've never seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Don't be so quick to protect me.
What is the capital of Greece?
Tom can't speak French, and Mary can't speak French either.
I first met her in London.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Watch where you're going.
They described the girl as a little girl.

Man is the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden faded.

What is the minimum wage in Luxembourg?
His fate is predestined.
Are those candles?
If you had to choose between piano and violin, which would you choose?
The answer is right.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the exam?
Don't miss the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
So far, so good.
This species is in danger.
I think you'd better lie down.

Tom speaks French as well as Mary.
How hungry are you?
This guy's stable.
I almost won.
It wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what happens.
I've seen you with Tom.
Tom's my friend.
You're going about this the wrong way.
Something's happening.
Fill it up.
We have little chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if it's the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it away?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved tangiblely to what it was.
I played you.
His joke was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems young people face.
I finally saw you. I've waited a long time for this moment.
Can you explain a little more?
Am I wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary to hold his hand.
I think we should look into it.
So we all agree.
If time permits, I'll go to the museum.
That tie really looks good on you.
I think you're gonna make a great dad.
There's no way to contact him.
Never give up, never give up.
Could you show me this bag?
This is my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You won't believe me.
Can you come at nine?
Let's synchronize the clocks.
I shop every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do this.
Is that a duty store?
I'm looking for a gift for my friend.
If I had told you, Kel fida.
This is the camera Tom used to take the photos.
Don't get lost.
I'm tired of changing my plans every time you decide you want something else.
He looks like a human from afar.
We worked hard to make ends meet.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I need to rest.
She said she wouldn't move an inch, no matter what anyone told her.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The defendant was given the right to appeal.
Let's not be hasty.
My dad went fishing.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You shouldn't jump to conclusions.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
Wine is the milk of adults.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he walks into his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I'm having nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a cab?
I hope I'm not too late.
I came home on the train.
Why are you always so mean?
Alas!
Is that why you didn't want to come with me?
Have you decided what you want to order?
I found the boy deeply asleep.
She used to call him the likes of it.
Are we capable of this?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I had to open my suitcase.
We talked about canceling the reservation.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The swimmers were frozen by the cold.
It's allowed for dogs.
The children are the flowers in our lives.
I had to cancel the invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be that stupid.
They hated Tom.
Go on.
It's a challenge for me, and I learn a lot.
Tom was exhausted.
I was counting on her.
Don't look at Tom.
I have to pay for it.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
That's one of the fish that Tom caught.
All right, let's go.
There's a car coming.
Looks like we'll be able to get there in time.

I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble.
Kids play dodgeball.
It's snowing.
I need you to clean your room.

What's the plan, Tom?
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Her condition continued to improve.
Does Tom really want me to go to his party?
I'm not tired at all.
Most people think I'm crazy.
How many museums did you visit?
I waited as long as I could.
He broke into the room without taking off his coat.
I went shopping last Saturday.
It's June 18th, and it's Muriel's birthday.
The way he works, he shows nothing to brag about.
We don't see things as they are, we see things as we are.
She pushed the door a little bit.
Come when you're comfortable.
Alexander wrote several sentences in Berberian.
I think you're the only one who cares.
What exactly happened to you?
That's when I first visited the museum.
Is she staying at a hotel?
I don't like this jacket.
Tom and Mary went down the stairs together.
You're early.
You want to leave at the last minute?

I'm getting better.
Your education is important.

I'd be happy if you could come with us.
It happens.
Did I say something wrong?
When you get to the light, turn right.
I think you've done this before.
