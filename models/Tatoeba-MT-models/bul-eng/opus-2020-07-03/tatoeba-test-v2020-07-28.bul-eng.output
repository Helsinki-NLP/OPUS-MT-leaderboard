Speaking French is a lot of fun.
Have you actually tried?
Hey.

I'll give it to you for free.
You better not go.
Spring is late this year.
If you don't speak English, the probability of taking a good position is much less.

Didn't Tom say anything about that?
French isn't that hard to learn at all.
I think you've done enough.
When did you start studying French?
I'll come to your place.
No one else offered to help.
Get your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I'll make you happy.
Let's play something.
What are you up to?

What else is in your pocket?
There was nowhere else to go.
The man pushed her aside.
A hug from you will make me happy.
I can't believe you still trust Tom.
Please forgive me.
We waited with little anticipation.

I'm not tired at all.
What's the point of being on time if everyone else is late?
The gust of wind blew the rain right in my face.
I want eternal life.
Are you sure you want to hear this?
I think you'll be pleased.

A lot of the kids were almost naked.
Tom, I think we should help Mary.

Me, too.
I don't like the way you're acting.
What are we doing here?
Subject is outside the scope of this investigation.
You're in my seat.
You're absolutely right.
You're impossible.
Tom said you'd come.
You have to be careful.
I think we're gonna need Tom's help.
What did you like?
It's gonna be okay.

I saw her cleaning the room.
How are you today?
I'm really interested.

That's not Tom's problem.
Hold on to the rocket.
Walking home, I saw her again.
Her hair is long.
I put it in your room.
I thought you were serious with Tom.
They won't bother you anymore.
I don't hate myself.
I don't give lessons.
Now it's your turn.
Do you love your mother?
I think you need a break.

I think what Tom did was really stupid.
I wish I could speak French as a language bearer.
I'd like to open an account.

I don't have any information about Tom.
She found a job as a typist.
Leave it to me.
They lied to you.
I have to go ask Tom.
You should have worked harder.
Her sweater is purple.
Now that I've checked in, what am I supposed to do?
Clearly, Americans can't even solve their own problems, so how do they even think they're capable of dealing with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak plainly so everyone can hear you.
I'm ticklish.
From now on, I'm going to study French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
It was awfully cold yesterday.
I forgot to give him the message.
I graduated American literature at college.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
We were worried out of our minds.
I think you'll be pleased.
Teenagers quit.
I wish I was rich.
I've barely started.

Remember, it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.

She bought a toy for the kid.
I didn't get an answer from you, and I was wondering if my e-mail got to you at all.
She was brushing her hair in front of the mirror.

Please repeat that one more time.
I think so.
A lot of museums don't work Monday.
They took Tom to the hospital to get his stomach pumped because he was eating something poisonous.
Don't make me do this.
You're sitting in my seat.
God forbid!
Green looks good on you.
I bet you know French.
For dinner, Tom took Mary to a restaurant on the beach.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
No matter how old you get, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sasayama?
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
What's the weather tomorrow?
Does she have any kids?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come back tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
There's no way to hide that fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
Some say that French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I love taking pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French wines?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom sat on a log.
The girls were dancing in the gym.
She's convinced that her son is still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
Finally, I stopped at the old house and saw the city again.
You won't see anything without a flashlight.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There are many ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit, I snore.
We've been using this insecticide for two years.
Come help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, too bad!
The bus arrived empty.
We have to keep helping Tom.
My mom's got a nice handwriting.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the meeting.
Tom buttoned his shirt and then put on his tie.
It's really cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she's nice to everyone.

You can come back anytime.

That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that no one said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I messed up your plans.
I'm going to have to ask you to translate this report into French.
Nobody's confused.
Everyone jumped.
Many merchants were robbed during the riots.
Why do I have to learn French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We're grateful for your help.
Since we're wearing clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's get started.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom's lower than average height.
I found the key.
I know this is important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful blouse.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who are worried about you.
I don't have any pencils.
I don't really know Tom that well.
Now I'm gonna tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
He's been living here for the last ten years.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Shit.
She calls me Kenji.
I have the information you asked for.
In a mysterious way, a sense of humor is related to national peculiarities.

You can do it, go ahead, I'm with you.

Aren't you glad to see me?
I really couldn't have done it without you.
I'm not mad at you, I'm just very disappointed.

Did you and my younger sister leave at the same time?
The match was postponed for a while.
His brother's been studying a lot.

He's crazy about you.
It comes from the inside to speak French.
Tom helped Mary put her coat on.
That kabuki book could be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this your book?
I've always wanted to learn French.
Are you gonna call Tom, or do you want me to do it?
Don't be scared of Tom.
He leaned on his elbows.
What's the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's disgusting.
What's the minimum salary in New Zealand?
I'm dealing with him for the price.
You can speak French, can't you?
My father rarely smokes.
His vain attempts to seduce her showed him that he had wrong address; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're soul mates.
The boss is very upset.
That doesn't change anything.
I'm meeting him at noon.
The invitation said there'd be popcorn and soft drinks.
Tom looks pale.
I hope this helps.
What did you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I've worked with Tom for a long time.
He's much older than Ken.
Where are the showers?
Mike ran really fast yesterday.

Do you speak French, too?
Just recently, I started learning French, so I'm not very good at it.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get an answer from Mary.
A boy, no older than five years, asked Tom how to get to the post office.

You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's with Tom now?
His concert was very good.
Another crowd of tourists arrived.
The door clicked and closed.
I'm hungry!
It's easy to talk to Tom.
The twins are totally alike.
Don't hang out with Tom.
I don't understand the joke.
I bet you know that.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Could you repeat that, please?
How much money do you have?
And I was sick.
I have some very bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Considering how long I've been learning French, I should be able to speak it better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
Do you want to buy a shirt?
I think you have the right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to visit Mary's party.
You won't be the only one there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happily.
I'm mad at myself.
This was made by Tom himself.
You wouldn't believe the things people throw out.
I quit smoking for a year.
Don't bring too much luggage when you're traveling.
I got Tom's picture right here.
I haven't told you everything.
They're both functioning.
Tom's not welcome here.
She accused her of lying to him.
There's no point in fooling yourself, you know she's playing games with you.
George is very enthusiastic about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He needs to be given an advantage over the others.
I double-crossed you.
Take him with you.
Just give me a second.
I swim once a week.
I waited an hour and a half.
He made a mockery of me in public.
The light's out.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
You've narrowed it down.
How about we have dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
This is the picture I took of Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I never spoke to Tom in French.
We all assumed that Tom could speak French.
Tom went back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You're not gonna believe this.
I'm looking for a house.
I don't feel well.
Why are you early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a night owl.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, don't you?
Do what you want; but I will hinder him if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I have to trust Tom.
I'm thinking of learning how to swim during the holidays.
Which way is the beach?
Are the Giants playing tonight?
I feel like he's not gonna let me freak out so easily.
It'll be 5:30 in a minute.
School starts at eight and a half.
Tom's taking a bath.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken jumped the wall.
The upper part of the mountain is covered in snow.
A hug from you will make me happy.
When are you leaving?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
There's a really good restaurant right by the beach that I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the image.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I completely erased you from my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
Are you thinking French?
I've never seen you so nervous.

By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Convicted to death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I don't have anything.
Think with your head for once.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of a new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
I'm just thinking about it.
You don't have anything else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you answer it?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We had to obey their request.
Pick the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so go to bed early.
That was stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I have nothing to offer.
I'm talking to my employees in French.
It's a picture of my sister.
Tom's hard to deal with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her some advice.
The room was so smoky, I could hardly breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He sure loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
Looks like she's a little under the weather.
Did Spot go, too?
I promise I'll bring him back.
I have family in Boston.
Get out of here!
Tom's wearing a raincoat.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I have to go talk to Tom.
What do you say we go to the library together?
I have work to do.
The job offer still stands.
Your shirt is missing a button.
I have to go out for a while.
Green suits you.
Fingers crossed.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see this one?
My uncle gave me this watch.
True friendship is forever.
Tom's used to working outdoors.
Tom pulled the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm getting on the bus.
Tom learns French every day.
In this shop, they do kitchen supplies.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You're supposed to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works in that bakery, she's cute.
Please pour me another cup of coffee.
Alice might be coming.
How do you do it?
I had a good time.
I'll stay the day after tomorrow.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Does anyone on your team speak French?
Looks like it's about to start snowing.
I've never seen anything like it.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never been to Mount Fuji.
You don't play golf, do you?
Tom doesn't work anymore.
It's probably nothing important.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumped.
What's the minimum wage in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has sparked heated debates.
Eat a live frog every morning, and for the rest of the day, nothing worse will happen to you.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
Unemployment is growing.
I couldn't sleep last night.
Russia lost 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy's smiling.
If you're going to France, you need to refresh your French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
We study French at school.
That's what he said.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I won't be able to tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please have patience.
Your joke is going too far.
I had a really good time today.
Christopher Columbus drank unfiltered seawater.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need this.
Everybody's hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseball player.
Tom wished he was still single.
I have three children.
Let me sleep for ten more minutes.
My uncle gave me the watch.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
Last week, I had pizza every day.
I promise I'll bring it back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
You must have made a mistake.
His daughter has become a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's at his desk, writing something.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I opened my check account.
He was here at the time.
I put my shoes on right away.
He felt uncomfortable in his father's presence.
Your shoes are untied.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took off his coat.
I can swim in the river.
Do you do French every day?
Don't make so much noise, please.
You're pretty good at French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one thought his words were important.
That's a weird problem.
I don't understand that.
What place do you live?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time for lunch.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got an A.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They're gonna play basketball after school.
Those clothes look good on you.
I couldn't say no.
That's surprising.
I heard someone come in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they take a bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something with you in person.
He was transported to the hospital by helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary had disappeared.
I'm sewing my shirt.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's engaged to Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was home alone.
In Esperanto, the nouns end in "o." A multiple is formed by adding "j".

I buy tapes.
We're gonna need Tom's help.
How tall is your brother?
Come visit us.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Jane's in serious trouble.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't showered in three days.
Triangles don't have four angles.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What is the minimum wage in Romania?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you gonna get home?
I wash my clothes.
I've heard that French is a difficult language.
I haven't completely eaten yet.
Soon you'll stop thinking about her.
Let me see.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big firm.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Go upstairs and go to bed.
Come on, touch it.
It's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years have you studied French?
Carol went back to her hotel.
Do you like this color?
Please be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered in snow.
Let's get out of here.
Shit, I forgot my camera!
He got off the train.
Mary goes out with two at the same time.
There's still no sign of Tom.
Give it to me.
Did you manage to do everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was woken up at five o'clock.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can connect with the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What do you want to tell me?
I'm looking for something less expensive.
It's much easier for Tom to speak English than in French.
I think you'd be surprised.
Next time I'll try harder.
I've done my job already.
He's a hero.
I don't have any requirements.
Her charm is a mixture of joy and kindness.
I should have listened to you.
I have brown hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
We're almost there.
I like that color.
My grandmother was operated in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you and Tom.
I don't think that's true.
I've got three cameras.
Ask for Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I have a chance to return the favor.
Tom went through the drawer to see if there was any pen I could use.
This requires careful consideration.
Tom won't believe it.
I need to know the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We ran after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I was young.
Be more specific.
Tom's French is really good.
Isn't the weather great?
I'm not uncomfortable with that.
I don't want to belong to the elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You have to study hard.
I'll be back soon.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom explained things in detail.
Don't let Tom get away with it.
He was playing football with an empty can.
I think you're really gonna like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm on vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You'd better put a sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process achieves good results.
That's what his ignorance is all about.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French is not good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are they criminals?
Can you get six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll throw him a farewell party.
What club do you belong to?
Atsushi might have been sick.
Tom didn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth rereading over and over again.
We're working together now.
Go back to your seat.
He's a Cambridge graduate with honors.
I have to get her back tonight.
I have to start getting ready.
Does Tom study French at school?
Which shoes are they?
We've definitely worked hard.
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it's warmed up.
He started to justify himself.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do this.
How old are your kids?
I'll stay till tomorrow.
Please call a doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You don't know half of it.
This is the picture I took of Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat herself.
I'm starving!
I'll help you get better at this.
My dad goes running every morning.
I saw Tom walking on the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't get up too fast.
She gave away all her dolls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Go away.
It's a big city.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim is dressed very attractively.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.
It's okay to create a website, just be careful not to violate someone's copyright.
Tom defended his wife.
She's got a lovely handwriting.
Fingers on the hand are five: thumb, index finger, middle finger, nameless and pinky.
The foil is made of polyethylene.
I solved the problem with ease.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
How much does a cab get out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is this yours, Tom?
I don't have many English books.
We have until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
Enthusiased began his respectful venture.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, the local cowboys laughed at him.
He seems to be in a hole.
I think you should come and see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary does.
Be more specific.
I'm on leave this week.
I'm washing my socks.
I promise I won't do that again.
I just gave blood.
He doesn't know French or German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
I have no doubt of his sincerity.
Please open the package.
It's on me.
I have no idea who he is.
Could you tell me your name, please?
These kinds of mistakes are inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Did you watch the game?
This is your home.
The losses were heavy on both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something warm to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary it was time for them to leave.
She does makeup every morning.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Do you prefer to speak French?
Wow, that's cool.
Don't make nice eyes at me.
I don't have any money.
Millie's eating bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't have done this without you.
Tom's not used to living in the city.
Keep an eye on Tom.
Jane went shopping.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
Long skirts are out of date now.
He's doing very well with kids.
Come in, please.
We were really having fun.
Tom hates that.
It's true she's dead.
Don't make a habit of it.
It finally stopped snowing and the weather warmed up.
She didn't exactly hint at what she wanted for Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in that book.
I study French every day.
I've heard every word.
Where'd you take your socks off?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons used properly are useful.
What are we going to eat?
Keep it a secret.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do this.
She gave me permission to use her vocabulary.
He's three years older than she is.
Don't get your hopes up.
What's the price of this umbrella?
Mom, can you hand me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to study French.
I'm not good with sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to make it.
I found out he's a genius at chemistry.
You can't just walk around talking about people like that.
I had a meeting at 2:30, but I got stuck in traffic, and I couldn't get there in time.
They went to the sea museum.
Tom is making a lot of effort to improve his French.
A lot of time was wasted for nothing.
They weren't talking.
I didn't call you a fool.
I want to speak French today.
You want to tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it so hard.
We're all connected.
One word of support, when you fail, costs more than an hour of praise when you succeed.
Are you sure you don't want me to drive you home?
It was finished.
His shirt was covered in sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You won't be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a fur coat.
I promise I won't do it again.
I made Anne a doll.
What did you graduate from, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
It's a very interesting story for me.
I've read that book.
That was a good year for you.
It's been cleaned.
I can't do that.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom a present.
One thing's for sure, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I've been convicted.
Tom was told recently that he had cancer.
Tom came home by bus.
For me, a meeting in the afternoon is a better option.
What do you have to do?
Tom studied French for three hours last night.
Raise your hand.
What's that?
It was too easy.
I travel a lot.
There's the hospital I was born in.
I never liked biology.
I owe you a lot for your kindness.
Let's split the prize fifty-fifty.
Shake my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think you'd better lie down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
I need to know.
Do you like to travel?
Your plan failed.
Tom had a big party at his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I just finished breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long will you have to wait?
Tom's the guy who told me when the meeting was gonna be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers began to return home.
I have a problem, I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary to play with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy looks so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.
Don't talk about people behind their backs.
She's reached adulthood.
Come with me for a walk.
I'd love to see the movie.
Whoever's well-prepared has no worries.
I had fun watching TV yesterday.
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees whose leaves the silkworms live on.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I've got news for Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let this happen again.
My joints hurt.
I've tried everything I know.
Why are people afraid of her?
He's been fighting hepatitis for six months, but it looks like he's just started recovering.
The universe is a mystery.
I'm back in Boston.
Where's your father?
How much is the bill?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I'll be in my lab.
Can I have your room number?
I suspect Tom has no idea what Mary did.
Patients often die simply because they bend to their diseases.
I wouldn't have thought the tofu was so good.
Are you jealous?
Who's planning this trip?
What time is it now?
Then what does it mean?
I haven't had my dizzy spell yet.
He's asking you to help him.
I've only been to Boston once.
I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
You think so?
He learned to swim.
You really can't swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too short.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
I'm getting pus from my gums.
I can't do this alone.
I hope you're right.
If you tell her about it, then she'll tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell their best friends, and then they'll all know.
She was cold.
Tom speaks with a French accent.
I've never seen a rainbow.
Ken can swim, right?
Tom and Mary went to the amusement park.
I thought it best not to say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Are you looking closely?
A few minutes later, the phone rang.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door, please.
Tom's finally gone.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
That's the cutest puppy I've ever seen.
I don't hold grudges.
This restaurant is good food.
That's not what I do.
Are they confused?
You parked in my spot.
I don't know where his is.
Unemployment, they create it.
I have to pick up my son at 2:30.
Sugar's sweet.
Where are you going?
It's a great poem.
The prices have fallen lately.
Tom's an interesting guy.
Are you trying to get me down?
If you're late for the test, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is this your family?
It's been a terrible day.
I don't live with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I won't be able to carry Tom to the other side of the bridge.
Where should we go?
You can't be mad at me about this.
I grabbed the cat by the neck.
Looks like he's gonna win.
I think you need a vacation.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I found something better.
There were a lot of frogs in that pond once.
I understand him perfectly.
Depends on the context.
Has anything changed?
I'm not that brave.
He prefers French to German.
You can read French, can't you?
Fred's often late for class.
Don't cry, you won't make anything better by crying.
Who's thirsty?
The girl eats bread.
I like parties.
I don't know what's what.
I can't buy you this dress.
I heard him coming down the stairs.
A friend of mine's coming to visit tomorrow.
I hope that happens.
Maybe Miss Satow sent the flowers.
Take us downtown.
The sea was quiet.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You're going too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to please Tom.
How long are you gonna be mad at me?
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why did you run away?
Who's your favorite bird?
You can study here.
Let me help you.
You wish!
I'm afraid I've offended you.
There's nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's devoid of experience.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom wasn't paying any attention to Mary.
Put these slippers on, please.
I hear it's nice.
Tom doesn't like that color.
I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.
Tom refused to go.
He's got blond hair.
I don't know when he'll be here.
Mary told John the secret.
Next semester I'm going to study French.
Tom's not giving a speech today.
I'll see you tonight.
I'm out of money.
I got him a cup of coffee.
Where's your babysitter?
Nothing ever goes the way you thought it would.
Why don't you want to wear a tie?
Children should obey their parents.
Are there mistakes in this exercise?
Can you come Sunday night?
I remember we've met before.
I think of him as my best friend.
No one answered the phone.
I've seen you somewhere before.
You're studying Esperanto.
The new bike cost me 50,000 yen.
I think you're crazy.
Save it for later.
They're best friends.
You're a problem.
You're so shallow.
I have great news.
Looks like it's snowing, doesn't it?
It's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom seems objective.
The tunnel fell because of the earthquake the day before.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Mary spoke Japanese slowly.
What have you been doing all this time?
My uncle never writes letters.
Close the damn door!
We made fun of him for it.
John came in a week ago.
He refused the offer, and so did I.
Oh, I forgot my keys.
Excuse me, I have a request.
A barber is a man who shaves beards and cuts men's hair.
Do you like Mozart's music?
That's my problem.
Is this yours, Tom?
We're not all that stupid.
Any problem can be solved if you are persistent and patient.
Tom started studying French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom works there.
I'm not her type.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives around here somewhere.
Tom loved to sing, but no one wanted to hear him sing.
Tom didn't lie down.
I think we can do better.
I think you should change your mind.
I don't hold grudges.
I'm just an office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let that bother you.
Have you ever seen the kangaroo?
Tom can't figure out how to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.
I'll tell them I'm not coming in time.
He often walks to school.
The socks stink.
When are you getting married?
It's a pheasant.
He got off the train.
You're cruel.
How many One Peas episodes have you seen?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is it a big difference?
You can take pictures outside the museum, but not inside.
Let go of me.
You're sweet and kind.
My sister lives near Yokohama.
I think you should make the deal.
That wasn't my intention.
I need to get out of here for a while.
She loves the color of her shirt.
Hey, man, I'm begging you, spray some insecticide behind the fridge.
She accused me of not answering the letter.
I'm tired.
Your English is getting better.
It's your turn.
Put another pair of socks in your bag.
Soon after that, it started to rain.
I have to go back to Boston tomorrow.
You don't ask permission.
Tom sent Mary a message written in French.
I'm glad you're happy.
When this conversation is over, he says a friendly goodbye and says good night to me.
Let's check it out.
You've done a good job so far.
I cooked dinner last night.
Tom can't get up.
I'm having a hard time concentrating today.
In advance, thank you for your cooperation.
Who told you my name was Tom?
Aren't you impressed?
Tom's not here today.
I have to buy one of these.
She helped him.
I have a job for Tom.
Where did you throw them?
As usual, the physics teacher was late for class.
Let's figure out what's right and what's wrong.
I forgot to turn off the lights.
Can I take a picture of you?
"Can I park here?" "No, you can't."
I've seen you somewhere.
You're sitting in my seat.
I've already tried that.
You don't speak French, do you?
I'm ready to order.
Students shouldn't use this toilet.
You're on a winning streak.
I'd like a drink.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She has no time for anything but taking care of the baby.
Nice to meet you, too.
The film wasn't as interesting as the book.
Let's go!
I don't want to be disturbed.
I don't think Tom's number is on the phone book.
Can you do it yourself?
Thank you very much for your detailed explanation.
I'm the only one who knows them.
She's having a run-in after dinner.
These containers are sealed airtightly.
He's the best player on our team.
I've seen you before.
There aren't any.
I want more detailed information.
Do you carry a gun?
He says he avoided danger by pretending to be dead.
Are you home?
Can you tell me what to do?
Be careful with her.
Don't shoot, I'm coming out.
Isn't that surprising?
He makes friends with everyone he meets.
You should study harder.
I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.
I just don't get it.
He broke into a house.
I got here later than usual.
We're not disappointed.
She was trembling with fear.
I was your mother's first friend.
The fight has ruined our unity.
How much money do I have to take with me?
Tom's good with French.
I'm into stories like that.
I'm used to it.
Welcome to Japan.
She's just shopping.
Don't forget, it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
"Whose socks are these?" "My sister."
I think you should call Tom.
She was a tall, slender blonde.
I gave Mary a book.
The doc told him not to eat between the main feeding hours.
Are there any survivors?
The skirt sticks to her legs.
We chose Jack as chairman.
This is my friend Tom.
They got into it with each other.
Tom's a French teacher.
We're going down to the next station.
Tom asked Mary to meet him in his office tomorrow.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom's light-skinned.
Thank you, that's all.
The bike won't start.
I'm early.
Let's go indoors.
Jesse immediately accepted the invitation.
Jack Nicholson grew up in New Jersey.
Is there free will?
I'll be there.
I think that's Tom's motorcycle.
I have to go see Tom.
It's been a long time since the last such a nice surprise for me.
Let's play Canadian.
I think we have plenty of time.
Yunko's a nice girl.
Let's have lunch.
I've waited so long for him.
Aren't they cute?
I can't change those plans.
I'll be home soon.
He was on a business trip.
I had a little fever this morning.
The medicine's working.
I can't walk anymore.
Tom has a very big nose.
Is this the right direction for the museum?
School starts at eight and a half.
It happened twice.
Deep breathing is healthy.
When was the last time you went to the beach?
We've gone crazy worrying about you.
He can't read.
You're doing just fine.
It's not gonna solve anything.
Maybe I'm wrong.
I hope this will make it easier to understand the meaning and memorize the new words.
I think they know us.
I have no intention of hurting you.
Can you introduce me to a doctor who speaks French?
Are you sleeping?
Our team was wearing red T-shirts.
How about a walk on the beach?
These dogs are big.
Everybody say cheese.
Tom's not getting paid.
The rain stopped me from coming out.
When I was your age, we had to walk up the slope to school, both ways.
He'll be busy tomorrow.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
Nothing more, thank you.
I already tried.
I think you're working too hard.
He drank a lot yesterday.
That's not gonna help you.
Just do what Tom says.
The prisoners have been released.
Be careful with that.
I can't see anything.
The meeting was postponed.
You don't have to leave.
It's been a great day.
How old was he?
That's out of the question!
Tom doesn't see you.
I wrote to my French teacher.
Aren't you coming?
I'll stay till noon.
I forgot his name.
I think you'll be pleased.
Let's not talk about this anymore.
Then what's the problem?
It wasn't that heavy.
It's business.
Please lock the safe.
She interrupted me.
They're both alive.
I'm too short.
Tom went abroad to study French.
Tom gave Mary his card.
I think you'd better stay with Tom.
Tom didn't do it.
That's the job I picked out myself.
I think we're out of gas.
Let me tell you something about myself.
We pushed the car.
What's the minimum wage in Germany?
We have something for you.
He was having a hard time breathing.
I don't eat pork.
Coming here was a mistake.
The newspaper published a profile of its new editor.
It was a failure from the beginning.
Why don't we get him a bottle of wine?
Five days after she graduated, my daughter flew from Osaka Airport to Germany.
The boy laughed at the girl.
Please don't touch.
I've seen Tom around here.
I need to get in touch with Tom.
I haven't showered in three days.
Just close your eyes.
Let's make friends.
I've just created a new text-processing program with which words can spell backwards.
We certainly need Tom's help.
Please give me a pillow and a blanket.
Your jacket and tie don't go away.
I wish I was as young as you.
I was amazed at how well Tom speaks French.
Tom lives a little further down the street that Mary lives on.
The new teacher is in the classroom.
Hurry up, or you'll miss the bus.
I thought I told you never to go there alone.
I think you'd be impressed.
He's in jail.
I think your answer's right.
I don't speak French as freely as Tom does.
Tomorrow's Mother's Day.
Pick the one you like.
In the clear weather, you can see Mount Fuji from here.

There's nothing you can do?
I have some information.
I love French.
He was our guide.
I'll get it.
The ship transports raw materials from Indonesia.
This is where my sister was photographed.
You'll be sorry.
In her school, no one's a better swimmer than her.
Is there a big house?
He drinks too much beer.
She's very shy, and she worries when she's at a party somewhere.
I think Tom's a nice name.
As long as I live, you will not be deprived of anything.
I heard what happened.
I like your shirt.
I'm telling you, she looks like her mother.
You should apologize.
How do you know that?
Tom might object.
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I think you'd better give up.
Parents often make sacrifices to give their children a good education.
Where are you from?
Looks like your dog's thirsty.
You're going to London next Sunday, right?
I have plans tonight.
I wouldn't bet on that.
You don't seem too surprised.
Apparently, it worked.
I need to teach Tom that.
That's a good sign.
Tom jumped out the window.
To tell you the truth, it's my fault.
Let me call you back.
I gave them clothes and some food.
You're wearing your socks upside down.
I'm getting up early tomorrow.
You like French, don't you?
She almost got run over by a car.
Tom's not like them.
I left my credit card at home.
It's too hot.
You're bleeding.
I just want to be with you.
I want to learn French.
She's eating an apple.
I think you should check under the couch.
My car was stolen last night.
Tom wasn't at the party.
Satisfied?
Why don't you get an umbrella just in case?
I really want it.
Maybe I'm wrong.
Have you finished your breakfast yet?
It wasn't my fault.
Read it one more time.
He arrived earlier than usual.
I talked to him about it on the phone.
I think you're very talented.
The races were moving almost empty.
We need more research.
It's your responsibility.
Come visit us.
I have to push my bike because one of the tires is down.
This shirt is standard size.
Don't make fun of me.
I put my hand on her shoulder.
From the store to my house, I carried the heavy stuff and I called myself a ho-o-op-hop.
What languages are spoken in America?
That's amazing.
When she heard the news, she passed out.
Don't be disappointed.
He overslept this morning.
If you're not happy with the service, don't tip.
I'll remember tonight.
I don't get paid enough.
I got up early yesterday.
For the last two months, Tom has been constantly moving from place to place.
I think you should get out.
He comes here twice a week.
This elementary school has a strong football team.
How can you not like Tom?
Hitomi seemed very happy.
Do you subscribe to any magazines?
I'm afraid I won't be able to make it to the lunch we arranged.
That's right!
That's probably the key Tom's looking for.
I had to walk there because my car broke down.
It keeps happening.
I have a lot of friends who speak French well.

There's not much difference in our age.
The box is too heavy to carry.
Let's vote.
The wounded were brought in by ambulance.
Don't move!
He named his dog Popeye.
There are people I need to talk to.
Tom speaks a little French.
I think you're missing something.
You always sing.
I left it in the garage.
I owe him 1,000 yen.
How can I find you?
Nick owes me ten bucks.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Don't punish Tom for that.
I've never seen you so scared.
Tom scored three points.
Do you like to walk on the beach?
When are you leaving?
Is there anyone with you?
Tom couldn't believe what was going on.
Did you have fun last night?
To put it bluntly, he's wrong.
They're already here.
There's a guy sitting in the kitchen.
I'm bringing her back.
When does the art museum close?
I've been busy this week.
You come from Sweden.
I thought we were having breakfast together.
Suck it up.
Tom teaches sports psychology.
What do you want?
Looks like you changed the whole room.

I think you're perfect.
The army had to withdraw.
Your success depends on whether or not you take the STEP exam.
I always wondered if you'd come back.
Tom never talks about his feelings.
He raised his hands.
A cup of coffee, please.
I haven't heard from Jane since she moved to Tokyo.
It was raining like rain.
I think you'd be impressed.
He thanked me for coming.
He's shorter than Tom.
Can you drive?
I can't speak English, let alone Spanish.
Someone must have stolen your watch.
Tom grew up speaking French and English.
What are you doing now?
The museum is worth a visit.
Tom's going away for a week.
I'm looking for a present for my father.
The problem is not worth discussing.
It was pretty cool.
- "For here or for home?" - "For here, thank you."
Bob came home very late.
The elevators aren't working.
It takes courage to do such a thing.
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
I drove her into town.
Anyway, you'll never know.
Believe it or not, peaches and almonds are from the same family.
You want to hear something funny?
There aren't enough chairs in the conference room.
I have no idea.
Tom wasn't perfect.
When I was a student at the university, I never slept the night before the exam.
I really want this.
I learned a lot of Spanish words today, and now I know how to say "buza", "brade" and "knee".
In winter, I sleep with two quilts.
Let's split it up.
I'll stick around.
You can go now.
I've never seen these pictures before.
Tom's hard to handle in situations like this.
She didn't like it.
He's got a strong body.
Are you scared?
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well.
Tomorrow's Sunday.
Tom can't see without his glasses.
Are these edible?
Something's moving down there.
I wouldn't blame you.
Maybe Tom wasn't wrong.
It was finished.
I would like a copy of this report.
Tom's a wreck.
Convicted to death.
She spent many days knitting a sweater for him.
Have you been on an express train recently?
Don't be late.
Are you involved?
I heard Tom was hurt.
How many One Piece episodes have you seen?
I heard they caught Tom's killer.
I really had a great time.
It's time for you to go.
Just thinking about the accident gives me goose bumps.
I've seen them before.
Why is Tom angry?
He speaks Japanese well.
The director's thinking about firing Tom.
I'll be with Tom.
"How many candles did you blow on your birthday?" "Fifty-six."
The plaid socks are hand knitted.
You're three days late.

The word expresses my feelings.
Tom's got some bad news.
Where did Tom say we should go?
Go wake Tom up.
I just finished my French homework.
I'm looking for my pen.
Let's have dinner.
I'll visit him tomorrow.
That guy was a jerk.
Tom likes to wear white socks with his sandals on.
This is against my principles.
I don't know why Tom's so mad.
What are the facts?
I wanted to scream.
I'm the one who saved Tom.
I've seen you somewhere.
She translated the letter from Japanese to French.
Am I fired?
Did anyone see you?
The village is far away.
What made you mad?
How do you know that?
I forgot.
He's in jail.
I don't know what to do next.
There's been no power since this morning.
There's a hole in my jeans.
Tom's working overtime.
He really speaks well.
I think you're making a mistake.
I've never heard Tom complain before.
They're probably drunk.
I'll show you where to go.
I don't have any privacy.
We have something for you.
I just finished my French homework.
Tom just made it.
I didn't expect Tom to be there.
How old are your cousins?
Your French has improved considerably.
What's in your suitcase?
At the end of March, we'll get married.
He raised his hands.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Good luck to you.
I think Tom was trying to warn us about something.
He married a pretty girl.
I took care of it.
Aren't you interested?
This is something quite different.
His brothers, his sisters, or he himself will go to the station to meet his father.
I gave up on Tom.
He disappeared without a trace.
You're very brave.
Speaking of trips, have you ever been to Kobe?
I have to go shopping; I'll be there in an hour.
Mary's tall.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Can I have the check, please?
Let's ask her.
I'm changing trains at the other station.
I heard you encouraging me.
I'll lend you this book.
I don't remember that.
Where'd you get the flowers?
I won't work here for long.
We want our own house.
I have to say it.
In theory, that should do it.
Both Tom and Mary can speak French.
It's personal.

You'd better not go.

I need to find another one.
You need to leave now.
The snow was up to its knees.
I feel bad today.
It's so sad to see Tom begging for money on the street after losing all his gambling money.
I've never seen anything like it.
You won't be the only ones there.
Do you understand me?
Do you speak Turkish?
I put it in your room.
There's no one home.
He still wants to come.
We have to postpone the celebration.
Tom looks great.
What could Tom be doing there?
I think that's Tom.
Just what I said might happen happened.
I was trained at this school.
Good afternoon.
I think you'll find this interesting.
How long before the shuttle gets to the airport?
Tom thought Mary was single, but he wasn't quite sure.
Go to the park.
She hated him.
Tom's not busy.
Ask for an expert.

Are there any questions?
Lightning struck Tom's house.
Miracles are called miracles because they don't happen!
It's too big.
What's the minimum wage in Australia?
I'm just curious.

She's a lot taller than me.
It's getting harder and harder.
Tom opened his eyes and saw Mary.
You're going to London next Sunday, aren't you?
Do you have any money on you?
Why didn't you tell me in advance?
I'll be back next week.
Stay with me, Tom.
The old man gave shelter to the child.
See you later.
I'd like to live near your house.
I think we got lucky.
I have to put an end to this.
You're so shallow.
It won't change anything.
Although the lives of people in China are now getting better and better, there is still much to be desired.
We wives have to stick together.
I'm Tom's partner.
Do you know who drew this picture?

What are they drinking?
Let's be friends.
As far as I know, he must have been born in Italy.
"Really?" "Yes, really."
Don't tell anyone.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I have to meet Tom.
Although Tom's English sometimes seems pretty good, he has no idea how far his abilities go, and it's impossible to convince him that he's wrong when he makes a mistake.
Are you John?
America needs you.
It's up to you to decide.
I saw a lot of tourists on the beach.
I heard you and Tom arguing.
Will you respond?
What's your home address?
Outside the dog, the book is the man's best friend. Inside the dog is too dark to read.
It's not working.
My mother made me a very nice skirt.
You need to start now.
It's an old letter.
Are you involved in any community service?
Are you interested?
Apparently, Tom was known before he released this album.
The Romans would have no chance to conquer the world if they were first required to learn Latin.
I paid 50 bucks.
Don't drink that.

Aren't you married?
It's what you've always wanted.
I'd like you to translate this document into French.
Tom was fired.
Clear the table already!
Mary's interested in politics.
She won't believe it.
Do you speak Turkish?
Don't hesitate to ask questions.

In this town, they've been mining iron for 350 years.
I'm playing a TV game.
Bill was in Japan.
Let's take a walk.
Are you still collecting stamps?
My name is Ichiro Tanaka.
Last year, imports exceeded exports.
You don't have a fever.
Has anyone ever told you that?
I'm not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happens.
Don't let him do it.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
I put my coat on the table.
This is the place.
A woman in a wheelchair is hiding in a supermarket.
This is your last chance to spend some time with Tom.
Can you speak French well?
What kind of person would do something like that?
I don't like snow.
Jane was waiting for her back to the tree.
We'll do our best.
Let's go upstairs and talk.
Tom didn't call me.
Tom doesn't like chess.
Those clothes look good on you.
I've studied French for three years.
I think you should come out now.
Please go away.
I thought you didn't like Tom.
Tom seems really happy.
Until yesterday, I never heard Tom speak French.
She's French.

I appreciate you coming to pick me up.
Make sure you turn off the TV before you go to sleep.
And my hands were shaking.
From now on, be more careful.
Tom jumped into the cold water.
Are you registered?
If there's no life after death, you better do something about this life.
I hope things work out for you, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
The hallway's slippery, be careful.
Languages like Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slavic roots.
Tom has to do this now.
You don't have to tell that thing to your parents.
Let's be honest.
She's the woman I gave the gift to.
Let me go alone.
I don't understand what he said.
This situation is ridiculous.
This land belongs to Tom.
I think you should meet Tom.
Don't add annotations.
He's not here yet.
Muhahahaha, your soul will be mine!
A lot of my friends can speak French.
He plays a good guitar.
Did you play Minecraft?
Nancy's afraid of dogs.
You'd be surprised what people think.
Are you currently taking any medication?
The tree's on fire.
I heard every word you said.
I haven't agreed yet.
I have to admit, I'm sorry.
Jack speaks English.
I want to see you.
I'm not jealous.
We took turns driving.
Can I take your coat?
My dad's cooking me a delicious meal tomorrow morning.
My TV's broken.
Tom just hung up the phone.
Are you ready?
I won't believe it until I hear it from Tom.
Tom can't see you.
I bet you're busy.
Come and see us.
Looks like you've had a rough day.
Tom doesn't give up.
But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't talked to Tom yet.
Are you involved?
What did you do with the camera?
I kept shooting.
Fewer teenagers are working today.
Why am I still listening to this?
Please don't.
Tom's handwriting isn't very pretty, but it's legible.
Shoichi's face has gone pale.
An electrical flux can generate a magnetic field.
Would it bother you if I turned on the radio?
I have things to do tomorrow.

Tell her I said hi.
Is your wife blonde, or is she a brunette?
I'm out riding my bike.
The men were taking the boy to the hospital.
They were talking too fast to understand what they were saying.
Tom's hurt, call an ambulance!
Are you sure Tom knows what he has to do?
Can we trust her?
This is the camera that Tom took the photos with.
Let's watch TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I have to go.
What's the whole story?
Don't push me.
What are your plans for Christmas?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.
You've been given an opportunity.
Could you put the dishes in the sink?
We found out where he lives.
It's not that deep.
He's a great scientist.
She wants a divorce.
The new magazine seemed very interesting to me.
Maybe we can help Tom.
We went on a journey full of hope.
I'll be here.
Don't beat me up.
I think you're really amazing.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom helped Mary move the cupboard.
Tell Tom to explain.
What's your connection to him?
I'm Tom Hunter.
That's a little weird.
Can you do it yourself?
In spring, the days get longer.
Mary let Tom kiss her.
I've never seen you cry.
Sometimes I hear my dad sing in the bathroom.
There's English in Singapore.
I eat bread.
That request was rejected.
You were right.
He was tired and still went to help them.
Tom's not going to school next week.
Do as I say.
The kids are already tired.
You want to watch a French movie, don't you?
We played for victory.
What's in the coffee?
The light bulb's out.
I have to give Tom his money back.
As many books as he has, so do I.
They didn't find Tom.
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
I'll always remember your kindness.
I've smelled that smell before.
Everyone's dying.
I don't understand.
Give me a hammer.
He hates shopping.
I think you'll be pleased.
I didn't tell him everything.
I don't want her to give up.
Mary's a bookworm.
I think you're capable of anything.
He objected to her plan.
I don't think we should do this.
You won't be alone.
Looks like the dog wants something to eat.
This box is a little heavier than it should be.
It's a famous mountain.
I could make you happy.
He told me how to get to the museum.
He likes to go fishing.
Is Tom still at school?
Texas is almost twice the size of Japan.
It's you or them!
I hope it's not too late.
His clothes always smell bad.
I think you should listen to me.
I forgot your number.
I've only been there once.
Put your jacket on the hanger by the door.
Tom lives three blocks from the coast.
He's a little celebrity.
I love pizza.
I'll try it again.
Just answer the question.
Leave him for another man.
Tom admitted he was scared.
If you listen a little more carefully to what the teacher says, you'll probably understand.
I think you should check under the bed.
The movie wasn't as funny as the book.
I wasn't attracted to work.
I think you're perfect.
Every human being is part of the whole of what we call the Universe, a part limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of its consciousness. This illusion is a kind of prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and attachment to our loved ones. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison, expanding the circle of our compassion so as to encompass all living beings and nature in all of its beauty.
He will surely come.
I'm familiar with that.
Aren't you going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
Do I have to fill out this form in French?
This local paper is published once a week.
I don't know who's who.
It's almost three o'clock.
I want to know more about you, Tom.
He just became a director.
We're studying French.
I think Tom and Mary like each other.
What is that thing?
Never give your cat dog food.
I'm having trouble with French grammar.

It's totally different now.
You're always late.
Let's keep going.
The walls were painted in light brown.

Do you really want to work in Boston?
Tom's not lying down.
Are you involved?
It's too big.
Tom just got back from Boston.
Ask again later.
He's my older brother.
She's become famous.
She refused his invitation.
We pray for peace.
I think you'll find it very interesting.
I didn't insult you to "dumb."
He and I are friends.
Our best friend is a doctor.
There's something about Tom that makes me nervous.
Both Tom's parents were professors.
Don't play baseball here.
Does Tom live far from here?
Bad weather wouldn't let me leave.
She's a nice girl.
Bob's a nice guy.
Looks like he's happy.
I've got blisters on my legs.
Why is that so funny?
Follow my example and get yourself a glass of wine.
Are you John?
I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to know when Tom's planning to leave.
She read the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He shot me.
Dogs are allowed.
Everyone thinks about changing the world, but nobody thinks about changing themselves.
She wants a divorce.
You have to study hard.
Did you accept his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
I heard gunshots.
I didn't mean to embarrass you.
Who did you translate this for?
If there's a desire, there's a way.
I think Tom made a big mistake.
If you relax and get some rest, you'll feel a lot better.
Are you done with your breakfast?
I've got some old computers.
Tom wondered where she spent her childhood, Mary.
Are you coming or not?
Do you speak Georgian?
Both Tom and Mary pulled out their weapons.
Do cats dream?
Do you know this girl?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.

You'd better not go.
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
Let's go ask her.
We usually speak French.
I'd like a shirt that fits this jacket.
I have no idea what Tom said.

You're always complaining.
The milk is sour.
The second lesson is very easy.
I love your name.

I'll stay home.
Take one of these.
What's your relationship with him?
The devil's custom must be forgotten.
My brother says he's not afraid of the dark.
Tom, I really hate him.
Problem was, I had nothing to say to him.
I think Tom was really enjoying himself.
I wouldn't do that.
Why don't you take off your coat?
Let's have a serious talk about your future.
I've got some calls to make, too.
Whatever happens, we'll make them talk.
Would you be so kind as to close that window?
The old couple went on a journey around the world.
When I woke up, no one was home, and I was abandoned all day.

Have you actually tried?

Take care of yourself.
That's very big.
I think you'd be surprised.
Do you speak German?
Put on a robe.
I bought some books at the bookstore.
Be loved.
There was a terrible accident yesterday.
He answered the questions correctly.
Put on your hiking shoes and don't waste time.
Why are you here so early?
Judging by your awesome tan, it looks like you spent most of your vacation on the beach.
It's probably snowing tomorrow.
I have no idea who Tom is.
Laura might have been sick.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Tom can resist.
She was perfect.
I have to keep trying.

Sooner or later, his luck will run out.
Looks like it's going to rain tonight.
Anne doesn't have any sisters.
Is it really that hard to speak French?
When was the last time you took a train?
Tom saw it, too.
I'm not trying to pressure you.
You're running.
Don't stay in bed unless you can make money out of bed.
Tom has to do this now.
I could make you happy.

He left me waiting a long time.
I'll go right now.

We want to rent an apartment in town.
I think you should come down here.
We arrived yesterday afternoon on the train.

Pick your favorite rocket.
I'll buy you sushi.

Look carefully at the map on the wall.

I think you'll find it very interesting.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
I haven't showered in three days.
I'm out of shape.
Bring me a chair, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.
Maybe you'll be happier at another job.
I like your shirt.
This is very important.
Thank you for your work.

Stop whining.
I know what Tom's doing here.
I know a man who speaks French well.
I think you were wrong.
He didn't stop him from staying up all night.
You probably already know about our company.
I think you've asked enough questions.
Tom doesn't need to know that.

My name is Emily.
Nothing else worked.
I have to get dressed.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
I haven't figured that out yet.
I need to talk to Tom.
Last night, the game was exciting.
Wide jackets are the last scream of fashion.
Don't get lost.
With a little goodwill on both sides, our problems should be solved.
I don't have much money.
She quickly climbed the stairs.
The house we used to live in has been demolished.
I'm getting married next Sunday.
Prices will continue to rise.
We're learning French together.
In high school, French was my favorite subject.
Can you get Tom for me?
Nobody knows if he loves her or not.
Put me on this side of the traffic light, please.
I think Tom's hiding from Mary.
Ah, I was sick.
Show it to us.
Why aren't you laughing?

Our son is getting married, and we want to make heads.

I knew he'd take it.
Don't leave town.
I heard Tom and Mary talking.
We met in London.
Do you have any wine?
This could be a little heavy.
Looks like we're running out of water.

Do they both understand French?
Something was taken.
Green suits Alice.
We've had our shit together three times a week.
They trapped the fox.
You're early.
You love kids, don't you?
I felt isolated.
What do you want?
I'm sad.
They're late because of the storm.
I guess that won't be a problem.
Speak slowly, please.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
I'm busy right now.
I feel really bad.
We were soldiers.
Work isn't just a necessity, it's a pleasure.
We have to be careful.
It's eleven.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom over there.
How was your last weekend, Nancy?
Are you studying French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I'm not being unreasonable.
I have to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You should use deodorant.
When I get up, I get dizzy.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are some things I have to take care of.
I never question his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not going to be a part of this.
You don't seem too surprised.
This is a warning we need to take seriously.
What does the fox say?
We'd like to eat, can you serve us quickly?
Let's get some sake.
Tell me a joke.
Tom is practicing to speak French at every opportunity.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
Apples are red.
You've got nice hands.
People in general are against the war.
Your hair needs a haircut.
I'm better.
Tom's never met me before.
May I see your driver's license?
This will never end.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bothering you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
What kind of tooth hurts?
We're learning French.
What makes you think that?
You're sitting in my seat.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
In school, we learn French every day.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'd be pleasantly surprised.
Tom seems lonely.
Let me tell you something about myself.
I haven't seen Tom since I was 13.
Her hobby is to collect stamps.
I don't have anything.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were supposed to talk more than we were supposed to, we'd be given two mouths and one ear.
Don't play baseball here.
I got your coat.
We had a great time last night.
I'll drive to Detroit.
You wouldn't believe how popular Tom has become.
Did Donna do it?
My dad takes me to baseball games a lot.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's girlfriend threatened to leave him.
Are you afraid of something?
He hasn't been heard from since he left for America.
Now I'm gonna have to deal with this.
I put my hands in my pockets.
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a great musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you heard from your sister lately?
Everybody's hungry.
She came down the stairs.
I was alone, studying.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think you'd better sit down.
Our sales are falling.
I saw Bob this morning.
Bring me something to eat.
If you have not paid for oversight, please send the due amount and allow us to remedy the problem immediately.
It smells like a toilet in here.
I'm here on vacation.
Looks like you're on your own.
It's a matter of consideration.
Tom was saved by a random passerby.
City hall is downtown.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm so hungry.
It's very kind of you to get out of your way to help me.
Tom thought Mary's story was interesting.
What do you say we stop the car and get some rest?
Tom lives in the same part of the city that Mary lives in.
Now it's a little after eleven, no quarter.
Both pronunciations are correct.
I've never seen an eclipse before.
We need to call the police.

I'll do my best.
I'll go with Tom.

Be careful!
I want a boat that will take me away from here.
Let's talk.
Diamonds are the girl's best friends.
When he was young, his parents died, so his uncle raised him.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
I have to warn him.
Where's the station?
Don't throw anything away.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't bark.
Is it safe?
He sleeps like a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister was.
I'll follow your instructions.
I have a sharp knife.
You painted the walls, didn't you?
My mom teaches flower arrangements.
What a beautiful weather!
Don't waste your youth, or you'll regret it later.
I think you'll find it interesting.

I think you should join us.
Can I open a can?
I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a private beach.
Why did Tom want to learn French?
This is where Tom was born.
Where were you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I have no idea how this works.
You're all fools.
They're exchanging gifts.
Personally, I don't mind.

I hope that's enough.
You need to focus on that fact.
This one's okay.

I didn't see anything.
Hey, I just got here.
I'm a hero.
Damn you!
Tom pushed Mary off the edge of the cliff.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Prepare for the worst.
Fruits rot in the sun.
He's always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes on the test.
Time's on my side.
Aren't you happy?
It might take a while.
I thought you might want to back off.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Watch out, there's a car coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take him with you.
I just remembered, you shouldn't smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled happily.
He's only four minutes from here by train.
What's Tom trying to accomplish?
Can anyone trust you?
It's a little oily.
I think we'd better go.
Tom said it probably wouldn't take too long.
What's the real reason you don't want to do this?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, come on, be quiet!
I would never hurt them.
I've studied French.
Can't you stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you depressed?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Both Tom's parents were teachers.
Children should listen to their parents.
It's foggy today.
Do you live in this neighborhood?
They made us work all day.
I think you're capable of anything.
He came home after he'd been away for ten months.
We're moving to Boston next week.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's take a break here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we're interested in Tom.
I'll take the next bus.
Tom's twice as old as Mary.
Mary has two boyfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not that tired.
You have a gum infection.
He started writing a novel.
He's satisfied with the result.
Hurry up and you can catch your train.
You won't be needing this anymore.
Put it back where you got it.
Let's get started.
I screwed you.
Tom found out Mary was stealing from the cash register.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it after all.
Can you do it yourself?
She's blushing.
Do you think I'm that stupid?
If you give someone 20 bucks and you never see him again, it's probably worth it.
That's Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum wage in India?
Don't make a decision about this today.
She didn't have much money.
You're in my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
Do you study French?
You shouldn't give up on English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What's Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
We're going to college next year.
What did you eat, fish or meat?
I made a check.
I thought Tom had the day off.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There's a lot of sentences for DNA, but there's not one for RNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to that.
Don't poke your nose.
The wind was blowing in gusts.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her eldest daughter is married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his classmates.
Of 20 students, only one has read the book.
I have business on Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have a tendency to trust established authority.
I came home on the train.
I think I can do that in my spare time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
What kind of situation would you do that in?
What was the name of the guy you dated before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
I'm really tired and I want to go to bed early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philologist.
She lives in New York.
He must be the principal of the school.
I bet I'll get there before you do.
He was painted like a clown.
In her presence, I'm embarrassed.
She bought him a dog, but he had a dog allergy and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
There was no TV or radio in those days.
She went to the museum in a cab.
Mind your own business!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These socks have holes in their heels.
Tom likes to knit.
You're a good doctor.
Don't ever say that word again.
I saw him stop.
She felt her knees shaking.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him some other time.
She wasn't that strong.
What a strong wind!
That's my CD, isn't it?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's dating a bunch of kids he shouldn't be with.
It'll be good if you don't interfere in personal matters.
Do you have to go to the post office?
My gums bleed every time I use dental floss.
We got here fast because the traffic wasn't loaded.
You have to be careful.
What do you miss?
He came back from France recently.
Molly's got a big watch.
Tom's not helping me.
I haven't been in touch with him in a long time.
Those glasses look good on you.
What did you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
Don't eat until the cramp passes.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's watching a dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom's not gonna help us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is French harder than English?
This pair of shoes doesn't fit me.
Are you afraid of something?
I have two cousins.
The leaves fall in the fall.
Aren't you going to do anything?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the meeting.
Since when does Toim learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
I'm feeling a little sick.
I'm so ashamed.
There seem to be over two thousand Uighur sentences in Tatoeba!
Tom's stubborn.
We can't postpone the reunion.
I'm ashamed I did that.
Let's cross here.
I know this is hard.
Are you a exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
Are you planning on going to Tokyo tomorrow?
I hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true Tom and Mary were arrested?
If humanity does not care for the environment, the environment will destroy mankind.
No, thank you, I'm just looking.
I felt like I was being rejected by these people.
I think you're gonna have a good time tonight.
Don't pick him up yet.
Sorry to interrupt.
Being too generous is his biggest flaw.
Press Shift button.
You understand, don't you?
Jane always acted like she was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know that.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It doesn't cost anything.
I don't mind the hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new business cards.
I'm thirsty.
The flowers are dying without water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you, Tom can't swim.
I forgot.
Check, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Guess what he told me.
We're out of salt.
She forgot to feed her dog.
That's not the problem.
Go meet him, and in the meantime, play this letter.
This hen hasn't laid a single egg lately.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
Dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait for me to finish, please.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life at school is going well.
Mrs. Jung didn't mind me visiting her unexpectedly.
You have nice lips.
Many people will lose their jobs because of the shrinking of the car industry.
He came to my rescue.
We'll start landing in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
We're running out of food.
Hanshin's moment of glory didn't last long, they were quickly shifted from first place.
Is there a big house?
Wouldn't that cause problems?
He resented being called a fool.
They're getting worse.
You really want to do this?
Will he fail the exam?
I don't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What conclusions have they reached?
Here we are at last!
I'm taller than you.
I consider myself lucky.
Tom could have lied.
I feel good.
She pressed the button.
I wasn't feeling well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
I gotta get moving.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put the pie on the ledge on the kitchen window to get cold.
Happy is that man who married a good woman.
Tom gave me good advice.
He's always telling the truth.
I can't live like this anymore.
Oh, what a shame!
Say hello to Jimmy.
Does it taste good?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't make me shoot you.
The equator divides the Earth's globe into two hemispheres.
It was personal.
Aren't you interested?
It's a great pleasure to watch baseball games.
I think you should take a break.
When did you start learning French?
She was brushing her hair in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it's going to rain today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where did you throw them?
How's Tom going to deal with this?
The thief got away with the money.
I haven't talked to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is the picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This is Tom's camera, right?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than her.
My uncle gave me the watch.
Please excuse me for being late.
I felt isolated.
I'm pretty busy.
They're pretty important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Take a look at that sweater.
I'd rather stay home.
That's not very funny.
The phone is something you can't do without.
I contacted them a few days ago, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My father drives very well.
We have to protect our children.
I'll see you later.
I'm completely exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistically.
I heard you encouraging them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister was.
In the summer, I intend to go to France.
Please stir the cards carefully.
Get on the bus to Badstrasse and get off on Zeeshtrace.
Laughter is good for your health!
This isn't a mistake.
I guess you're the Tom that everybody told me about.
Add this website to "Prefered".
When the sun of culture is low, even dwarves cast a great shadow.
When is the museum open?
I've seen you somewhere.
He sat on his bench.
We just cleaned the toilets.
Tom and I have a meeting at the mall.
I won't give in to threats.
You're in better shape than I am.
Are you ticklish?
I hope it helps.
He tried it himself.
I'm with the FBI.
Tom works for me.
He's up late.
Tom's getting better.
I walk like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch your step.
Can I take your knife?
You have to deliver the report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you'd told me earlier.
Don't look at the camera.
It's raining, but we're still going.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't take my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret this.
I thought Tom was gonna cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want to eat something.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister was.
We're like brothers.
I can't even get the water to boil, let alone bake a turkey.
What's the name of this river?
Is she available for you tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
In winter, the roads are covered with ice.
We almost didn't have time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm an adult now.
I want to go.
Bring her back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want an orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom speaks French like a Frenchman.
I think we should make a deal.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket box?
I'm really busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you're gonna need this.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Bring me something to drink.
Am I gonna die?
I got a little carried away when I was dancing, and I went up to the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this into pounds.
I think Tom lied to us.
I wish Tom would smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and rest for a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was shaking down the bumpy road.
Tom has a right to know.
The wind is yours.
She passed the exam.
I'm going to the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do that?
I've met him before.
Tom never gave up.
Tom's not in trouble.
I made a few mistakes on the exam.
This book is not Tom's property.
Where was that?
I have to take it off.
Is there anything I can do to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work in a hospital.
Tom's a grown man now.
Let's not kid ourselves.
I'm fine.
It's not art, it's a vagina with teeth.
I never saw you.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so cooperative.
Have you heard of him?
She washed the shirt in a hurry.
Is anyone with you?
The museum is open to visitors.
Does Tom really want to win?
My grandfather loves to read.
Did you know you wore different socks?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, baby.
Tom had one wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary Friday night and Alice Saturday night.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary does.
You can't read French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
It's a letter paper.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I don't hear anything.
We'd better make sure.
I can't help you.
He came out from under the car.
He writes to his mother from time to time.
Men get in shape, riding a bike.
This isn't the end of the story yet.
Take your time.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's take a break under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Get me a dry towel.
Jim's name is James.
Are there any other hotels you can recommend?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding!
More tests are needed.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there such an expression in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Anne's a little girl.
Just keep your fingers crossed.
I'm on my way to the park.
I like to play basketball.
The train arrived ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep countryside.
I'm sorry.
I don't waste ammunition.
You're my best friend.
I've arranged a meeting.
I haven't told anyone about us.
That was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French poems?
Ken wasn't running.
I paid for the video in five instalments.
I just want to hang out with you.
She turned twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What's that supposed to mean?
They come from Sweden.
Watch out when you cross a busy street!
A man has to work.
That's intriguing.
What's your nationality?
That part's good.
Merry Christmas!
Come on down.
Mary's running.
They yearn for city life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog was walking around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It happened between eight and ten o'clock.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
You sure you don't want one?
Tom came running with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom gave up too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary talking about it.
Let's eat sushi.
Throw those socks away, please.
Please be more careful in the future.
Tom was overwhelmed by a panic attack.
Can I open a can?
He was a baseball player.
Don't say such things.
He came after you left.
Did you eat breakfast?
The room is fully furnished.
I admire your courage.
I'll check upstairs.
Tom's in first class.
Don't stay out too late.
I'm taking the day off tomorrow.
Nor did I say that.
It's better to give than to take.
Can you take this, please?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you solve this problem?
I think you've had enough.
You've told me that before.
It's been six years since I started learning English.
I can't buy you this dress.
I work like a bee.
Brian made Kate wait for him.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed Tom doesn't usually lock his door.
Can you help me translate this?
Tom barely knows anything about French.
It's the same hospital where Tom works.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to be a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This air conditioner spends a lot of electricity.
Don't fall for this shrewd propaganda.
Tom thinks the death penalty should be lifted.
First the good God made the man, then he made the woman, then he took pity on the man, and gave him the tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Boys, don't make any noise.
Don't look them in the eye.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
Does this look familiar?
Get your coat.
What money do you have?
It won't change anything.
The building's almost finished.
I thought they were unemployed.
I better get to work.
Aoi's dancing.
Today, machines can do a lot of things for people.
He went for a walk.
Please start now.
I've seen your driver's license.
Where's my room?
Tom suffers from flat feet.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Human stupidity is infinite," I say, and because of this self-criticity, I consider myself an exception.
The storm wouldn't stop, on the contrary, it was getting stronger.
Tom had Mary translate the letter into French.
Unemployment is still high.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Is that what Tom would want?
The whole road's going uphill.
Aren't you ashamed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I wish things were back to the way they were.
Show me.
Tom got a tooth pulled last week.
The more you run, the more tired you get.
Don't cover up how you feel about that.
Is there something for me?
Can you open the door for me?
The girl's Irish.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom's been sick a lot.
The key doesn't fit the lock.
What's the minimum wage in Italy?
Tom turned the light back on.
That's my bike.
I'm not used to eating spicy.
Pick what you like.
Go over there and talk to her.
We met at a summer camp.
Don't talk in the classroom.
That's not from me.
When my father found out I was dating Nimrod Nick, he got really angry.
Master made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we were having breakfast together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find it was Tom's fault.
She put her sweater on.
Sometimes I run out of money.
Don't worry, Mr. President: with such bad gums, she hardly even has teeth.
I've never seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a cozy little house.
Go back to bed.
Why didn't you try on the dress before you bought it?
Tom killed himself jumping off a cliff.
Where were you born?
These clothes look good on you.
They headed straight for their goal.
The boy came in through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
Check, please.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Are you finished with dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his grandfather's violin.
Do what you think is right.
Are you falling in love with Tom?
Perseverance pays off.
They arrived separately.
To speak French is fun.
Tom's not gonna make it.
Prepare for the worst.
I believe the Earth is being watched by alien intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think there's been a mistake.
My dad's walking in the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each of them a pencil.
Don't rush me, I think.
I think you should grow a beard.
Do you like French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another soda?
A lot of people share my view on this.
Shirt's clear.
Some tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He's finished his big venture at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't need to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
The child is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be ignited.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Put the words in alphabetical order.
Tom can speak French a lot smoother than me.
I'll hide in here.
She took care of her sick husband.
He was playing while he was walking.
I saw the girl in the crowd.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English and I can't speak German.
I don't have insurance.
He graduated Yale with honors in 1921.
I think I have a way to save you some time.
My name is Roberto.
I opened the door and kept it open for Mary.
We make cheese and butter from the milk.
How many One Piece episodes have you watched?
I haven't really thought about it.
I'm off this week.
If a sick woman folds a thousand paper cranes, her wish will come true.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I don't owe you anything!
The bus driver didn't see the pedestrian.
Why did you leave?
I want my shirt back.
I spent my vacation in Hacone.
Look at these papers.
I'd like to translate that into French.
He didn't say a word.
They drink tea in the living room.
Tom started the engine.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk.
Boil 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that enough for you?
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Your bike is better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Be careful.
How do I get to the airport?
Who pulled it?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're boys.
Bad weather prevented us from leaving.
I'm learning French now.
Because I didn't know where to get off, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm so busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Be there tonight.
You're on a winning streak.
I can't be mad at you for that.
The spread of television has greatly deprived us of our reading time.
It'll take me forever to explain everything.
Don't peek in my closet.
The new coronavirus is very contagious.
Every time I look for you, you're gone.
You get off at the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm here unofficially.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't be here by 2:30?
Tom taught me how to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and toast.
I have to fix this.
I made breakfast.
He's studying English literature.
It's a stupid knife.
She gave me a big look.
It's forbidden to smoke in school buildings.
I'm really tired and I want to go to bed early.
I love you more than anything.
Why are you here so early?
Some people are good at speaking, and others are good listeners.
I didn't get the last word.
No matter how rich she is, she's not happy.
Go and see for yourself.
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
You can meet him.
Close your books.
I heard someone's coming in.
Tom took his father's path.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom approached me in French.
He can speak Russian, too.
Japan has many features.
Do you believe there is a god?
I walk with the dog at night.
What's your blood type?
Ten houses burned down.
I should never have let you do this alone.
Convicted to death.
I've only been waiting five minutes.
Can you show me your photo album, please?
Tom's house burned down.
The greatest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How much does your daughter weigh?
Tom shouldn't have done that.
I'm an atheist.
I never write the words "borscht" and "shchi" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom's knees are shaking.
I'll come with you back to the hotel.
Give me some milk, too.
I think she's over 40.
Do you have the driver's license?
I don't need your help.
He's at the door.
My business is back on track.
The keys are on the table.
I'm on my way to the park.
He reported the accident to the police.
I don't see him.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid there's no talking about a promotion now.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you afraid?
I didn't talk to anyone today except Tom.
I can barely hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you turn off the light?
He drinks an average amount of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's gone.
You're wearing your socks upside down.
We just got word from Kansas regarding your brother.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Is this new model on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
What's this about, anyway?
Watch out for Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 yen a month.
You're in the way.
She got the ticket without giving anything.
A lot of people think retro cars are pretty expensive.
The GNP for the third quarter exceeded 1% the previous quarter.
I'm sorry, I have to study.
I forgot to tell you what to bring.
Can you even see anything out there?
Everyone was at work.
I'm out of gas.
Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it the way you told me to.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was on my bus.
I waited a month.
I have to go meet Tom.
He was forced to sign the contract.
Not so much the disease knocked him down as the laziness.
Aren't you scared, Tom?
Allah is great!
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the movie, she's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to go to my house?
Go back to bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
My dog's watching TV, too.
Let's get to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not crazy.
He watches TV sometimes.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
Hurry up, it's only 30 minutes before the train leaves.
The participants are preparing for the final round of the competition.
I have plans for Saturday night.
I feel like I'm tired.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Coming here was a mistake.
Don't be so picky.
Her hobby is to collect stamps.
I don't understand German.
I think you'll like it there.
I'll be okay.
Tom won't know anything about this.
Don't forget to bring your kitchen supplies like knives and cooking dishes.
We're here.
Where are you going?

How can I leave?
You can't go into the museum.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to.
I didn't mean to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom's swimming really fast.
Add this site to "Prefered".
I have a lot to say about that.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's your concern.

I care.
Did you hear Tom speak French?
Beautiful sunset, isn't it?
You really speak French quite well.
Say hi to Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should choose Tom.
Something's happening.
Do I make myself clear?
Many parents worry that their children do not get basic knowledge of numbers.
I graduated philosophy at my university.
Which beach do you like to go to?
You can always give part of the job to junior employees.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very pretty girl.

It won't happen again.
You're the reason I did it.
Stop it or I'll let you know.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I have to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another appointment.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is this?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I have no intention of retreating for a while, and not to mention finally breaking up with him.
He didn't get the job.
I think you're gonna do great.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we have enough food.
I'll be on the next bus.

I've told you this before, haven't I?
Why do you keep saying there's plenty of time?
I'll pay you a visit tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or your silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like an orange juice.
From the moment I took your book, until I left it, I used to roll all the time, and one day I'm going to start reading it.

This is the hospital where Tom was born.
You don't have to wait here.
Both Tom and Mary covered their eyes.
That's my baby.
I'll give you all the information you need.
Stop whining.
You can't just walk around talking about people like that.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insured.
I'm borrowing money.
She's getting ready for college.
I think you're really amazing.
Looks like all Tom wants is money.
I'm not going with you.
For cold weather, when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this type of thermos.

The old man stopped her.
She hated being called a coward.
I like it a lot.

I completely forgot.
She gave me a nice gift.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of kings.
I have no intention of apologizing to Tom.
What do you do?
During the holidays, I read all Milton's work.
What do you recommend?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Each student was asked a question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I've never seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Take your time protecting me.
What is the capital of Greece?
Tom can't speak French, Mary can't speak French either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Watch where you're going.
They described the girl as a small one.
Tom's not used to city life.
Keep your promise.
I forgot about that.
I think you're putting too much sugar in it.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll take you home.
Man is the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden are dying.
They made us work all day.
We elected him chairman.
No kidding?

If I hadn't noticed, I would have told you.
What is the minimum wage in Luxembourg?
His fate is predestined.
Are those candles?
If you had to choose between a piano and a violin, which one would you choose?
The answer is correct.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the exam?
Don't miss the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
So far, so good.
This species is in danger.
I think you'd better lie down.
I like you a lot.
I rang the bell.
Wolves move in packs.
Do you have medical insurance?
Look out, Tom!
On Sunday, the museum is closed.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom won't back down.
It'll cost about 10,000 yen.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary does.
How hungry are you?
This guy's stable.
I almost won.
It wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what happens.
I've seen you with Tom.
Tom's my friend.
You're going about this the wrong way.
Something's happening.
Fill it up.
We have a small chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if it's the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it away?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved markedly from what it was.
I played you.
His joke was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories that you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems that young people face.
I've been waiting a long time for this moment.
Can you elaborate a little bit more?
Am I wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary to hold his hand.
I think we should look into it.
Then we all agree.
If time permits, I'll go to the museum.
That tie really looks good on you.
I think you're gonna make a great dad.
There's no way to contact him.
Never give up, never give up.
Could you show me this bag?
That's my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You won't believe me.
Can you come by at nine?
Let's synchronize our watches.
I shop every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do this.
Is this a duty-free shop?
I'm looking for a present for my friend.
I wish I had told you, Kel Fida.
This is the camera that Tom took the photos with.
Don't get lost.
I'm tired of changing my plans every time you think you want something else.
He looks like a man from afar.
We worked hard to make ends meet.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I need to rest.
She said she wouldn't move an inch, no matter what anyone told her.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The defendant was given the right to appeal.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
My dad went fishing.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You shouldn't jump to conclusions.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
Wine is adult milk.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he walks into his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I'm having nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary had disappeared.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you are.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a cab?
I hope I'm not too late.
I came home on the train.
Why are you always so mean?
Alas!
Is that why you didn't want to come with me?
Have you decided what you want to order?
I found the boy fast asleep.
She used to call him the likes of it.
Are we capable of that?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I had to open my suitcase.
We talked about canceling the reservation.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The swimmers were numb from the cold.
It's allowed for dogs.
Children are the flowers in our lives.
I had to cancel the invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be that stupid.
They hated Tom.
Move on.
It's a challenge for me, and I'm learning a lot.
Tom was exhausted.
I was counting on her.
Don't look at Tom.
I have to pay for it.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
It's one of the fish that Tom caught.
All right, let's go.
There's a car coming.
Looks like we'll be able to get there in time.
Being a troll is an art.
I ordered you a beer.
I haven't seen him in about three years.
Let's play baseball.
She's a bodybuilder.
The man eats bread.
He swam across the river.
You don't remember, and I'll never forget.
I wonder why I'm so tired.
Please give my regards to your family.
When someone mediocre sends a message in a bottle, it's just a childish fantasy, and when Christopher Columbus sends a message in a bottle, the fate of an entire country is at stake.
Are you sure you don't want to help me?
I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble.
Kids play dodgeball.
It's snowing.
I need you to clean your room.
I tried to be human.
What's the plan, Tom?
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Her condition continued to improve.
Does Tom really want me to go to his party?
I'm not tired at all.
Most people think I'm crazy.
How many museums did you visit?
I waited as long as I could.
He broke into the room without taking off his coat.
I went shopping last Saturday.
It's June 18th, and it's Muriel's birthday.
The way he works doesn't show anything he can brag about.
We don't see things as they are, we see things as we are.
She pushed the door a little bit.
Come when you're comfortable.
Alexander wrote several sentences in Berber.
I think you're the only one who cares.
What exactly happened to you?
That's when I first visited the museum.
Is she staying in a hotel?
I don't like this jacket.
Tom and Mary went down the stairs together.
