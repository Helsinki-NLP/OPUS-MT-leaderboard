I think we'll stay in Australia for a few weeks.
On the other hand, the Bible does not teach that the dead are conscious of nothing at all.
I know that Tom was a very close friend of Mary.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავ კჲი ბთ დჲ ნაოპაგთლ.
Tom thought that you could take care of yourself.
ჱაღჲ ნვ მთ კაჱა, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ბთ დჲ ნაოპაგთლ?
I don't know, Tom would agree.
ტომ's shut up his computer.
I don't think so.
ჲფვგთენჲ რჲმ ნვ მჲზვ ეა დჲ ოპაგთ ბვჱ ოჲმჲღ.
Tom and მერი said it was John who was really on the lookout.
ტომ can do the same for you.
You're actually saying that he's going out with another გოგონა, right?
ნვ ჟყმ დჲ ნაოპაგთლ გვენადა ღჲმ რპწბგა.
I don't think Tom was ქვტly.
Names in this article have been changed.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ ღვ რთ ეაევ კლძფჲგვრვ.
Well, I was wondering if Tom ოდესმე asks მერი why they're doing this.
ბთჳ დჲ ნაოპაგთლ ჟამ, აკჲ რჲმ ნვ მთ ოჲმჲდნა.
Tom says he wants to change his plans.
What would you say to a member of the opposite sex?
Tom's telling me that John's hungry.
I don't think Tom knows that.
If you are a Christian, you may find it hard to believe that the Bible is God’s Word.
ტომ and მერი ჲბვღა that they will never get involved again.
Tom says he's supposed to stay in Australia for a while.
ტომმა უთხრა, რომ იცოდა, რომ არ მისცემდა ნებას, რომ სკოლაში ასე მოქცეულიყო.
ჱნამ, ფვ მჲდა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
I don't think that's the time to leave Tom.
I mean, Tom says it's me.
Those guys reminded me of someone I know.
Tell her I'm not going.
His face changes to the თეთრი.
I think we're hearing some.
გვფვ მს კაჱაჳ რჲმ, ფვ რპწბგა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
So I decided to stay home from work on Mondays.
I'd rather not do this alone.
The only person who can steal the ყელ of Mary's.
- I don't think that's right.
- No one will.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think that ტომი was insufficient by what was going on?
It is still a fight.
Who Teared in კარზე?
I don't think that ტომ was the only one who knew what to do.
She's saying she's supportive.
I think that’s a good idea.
I mean, what you're saying makes everyone feel good.
ტომ and მერი მითხრა, რომ ისინი ექსsolences.
“ It’s not easy, ” says Tom, “but I’m not sure what I’m doing. ”
იმედი მაქვს, არავინ მოვა.
I think I can do that.
I don't think so.
Tom says that she thinks that she is in the საძინებელ.
ტომ and მერი are told to tell anyone.
გჟთფკჲ ღვ ბყევ ნაპვე.
ტომ მითხრა, that's all right.
I know that Tom wants me to do so.
(Native language.)
ბთჳ ჱაბპაგთლ ჱა რჲგა.
Tom says he's on his way.
They think it is the hope of a resurrection.
I mean, I'm going to have to take care of myself.
Tom and მერი tell everyone that they are happy.
I think you're saying, "I'm glad you're doing this."
Tom could speak French a little.
I know that Tom was very tall than I did.
I think that's what you want.
ნვ მჲდა ეა ოჲგწპგამ, ფვ რჲგა ღვ ჟრანვ.
I know that Tom's been very busy.
I don't think that's why I'm here.
I knew that Tom was too quick to do this than Mary.
“ I don’t know what it is, ” she says, “but I don’t know what it is.
- ნვ ჟვ რპვგჲზთქ ჱა რვჟრა, ნალთ?
He says that he is willing to help others learn about Jehovah and his purposes.
კაჱაჳ რთ, ფვ ნვ ჱნამ ეალთ რჲმ ღვ კაზვ თჟრთნარა თლთ ნვ.
Oh, my God.
Tom says I'm going to do what he says.
You know, that's what Tom and მერი want to do.
You need to use a toothbrush.
Tom thought that she loved me too, and she loved me.
I was surprised to see how much I had learned from the Bible that God’s Kingdom is a heavenly government in the hands of Jesus Christ.
It is not easy for us to do what is right.
We're on our way around the ტბ.
I don't think it would have been easy for Tom to say goodbye.
He says they're gonna work on Mondays.
I don't think that ტომ was as მდიდარი as most people think he was.
And they will have to beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears.
You're so hot!
ტომი 30 წლის იქნებოდა, თუ ის გასულ წელს არ წავიდოდა.
They say she's really mad.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ჱნავ, ფვ თჟკამ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
I wondered if Tom was safe.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავქვ, ფვ რჲი ნვ ბთ რპწბგალჲ ეა დჲ ოპაგთ.
Do you know how to buy a new computer?

Tom says it feels like it is.
ნვ პაჱბთპამ კაკ მჲზვ რჲგა ეა ჟვ ჟლსფთ.
You are worth more than I am.
Today, millions of Jehovah’s Witnesses are doing their best to reach out to people of all races and backgrounds.
I think Tom's უკვე ეჲჟრარყფნჲ.
Have you ever met anyone in ბოსნიაში?
“ I don’t know what it is, ” she says, “but I don’t know what it is. ”
Someone's told the truth.
I think you'd be happy to see me.
ტომ acknowledges that I'm the one who steals the money of მარი.
The same is true of Tom and მერი.
You'd better tell them.
How did you talk about Tom?
Ferrell, in love in 2.
ტომი და მარიამი ყველაფერს გააკეთებენ, რასაც გთხოვენ.
I know that Tom can save himself by doing so.
Tom says that he’s been the only one who wants to be a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
მე არაფერი ვთქვი, რის გამოც ის გაბრაზდა.
When should we get started?
You're a very negative person.
In the meantime, though, he was determined to do so on the basis of his Bible - based convictions.
It was late.
რთ ნვ ჟთ ვეთნჟრგვნთწრ, კჲირჲ ჱნავ კაკგჲ ჟრაგა, ნალთ?
A pilaf with some kebabs was in heaven.
Tom and მერი tell ტომ that they are on the move.
“ I don’t know, ” he says, “but I don’t know what to do. ”
I mean, who has a e-mail?
If you were to say something too good to be true, you would probably have done so.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ ის იმედოვნებს, რომ არ გსურთ ამის გაკეთება.
Tom says he wants to be there.
I think you're saying you'd like to go.
- ჱნამ, ფვ რთ ნვ ჟთ ღაჟრლთგ.
Tom and მერი say it was all the time.
You may need to be in Australia for a few weeks.
მე არ ვაპირებდი ამის გაკეთებას, მაგრამ შემიძლია, თუ ნამდვილად გსურთ, რომ ასე მოვიქცე.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ ჱნავ ნწკჲი, კჲირჲ მჲზვ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთ.
Tom says he's expected to eat.
Every day, I went out and went out.
Who's the lucky guy?
- She's pretending to be me.
I knew that Tom was a little bit shorter than Mary.
The Bible says: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it. ”
დარწმუნებული ვარ, ტომ would say no.
ჟთდსპვნ ჟყმ, ფვ ღვ სჟოვვქ.
You know, Tom and I would do it, right?
ტომ and მერი მითხრა, რომ ამით დაასრულებდნენ.
ჟთდსპვნ ჟყმ, ფვ რპწბგა ეა ჟვ გყპნვმ რამ.
You know, when you first heard Tom say good Gaul.
I don't think so.
I mean, Tom says he thinks he's missing something.
It has been a part of the Christian congregation, and it is a privilege to be a part of it.
I know that Tom would like to do that, but he does.
ტომს მართლაც ბევრი აქვს თავისი plate იმ მომენტში.
ვიცოდი, რომ ტომ is aware of who needs to do so.
I think you should drive.
The apostle Paul wrote: “Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together,
That's not fair.
That’s what I’m saying.
They're on your own.
I know that Tom was better than I did.
I think you love Tom.
That's right with the technology.
They say that she tried to be optimistic.
Tom says the cell always speaks French.
It was just a matter of concern to me that Tom's said he would do it.
I don't think that's what Tom needs to do.
Tom and მერი say it's wrong.
Tom says he's been allowed to do that.
I don't think you're going anywhere with this.
Tom claims that she thinks she is 30.
You've got a sense of tummy.

That's something I want to talk to you.
I don't think Tom would say that.
Tom and მერი say that they need the help of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
I think he's 40 years old.
Would you like to be an austere?
Tom says she knows that she is coming.
- No. No one's here.
Well, it was just a matter of concern to me, sir.
- Hey. - Hey, hey, hey.
ჱნავქ, ფვ ნწმა ეა კაზა ნთღჲ.
I did not do it tomorrow.
From now on, it was my custom to walk.
So I asked myself, ‘ Can I be a better person? ’
ტომი ამბობდა, რომ მზად იქნებოდა, დაგვეხმარებოდა.
I don't think რჲმ was capable of it.
ტომი არ იცოდა, რომ თვითონ უნდა მოქცეულიყო.
ტომი ხვდება გოგოს, რომელიც სამი წლით უფროსია.

There's a certain amount of ჭეშმარიტება in the words he said.
Tom says he wants to write a book.
I think that ტომ was a slob.
He was a virtuoso.
I think რჲმ's calling on you.
In turn, he needed to do so.
Tom says he's calling at 2:30.
ტომ's still told us what we need to do.
I knew that Tom was a good diver.
It's hard to say to anyone.
I don't know what it means to stay home.
I don't think that's enough food to feed you.
He's the one who's in the concession.
Tom says he's a doctor.
I was disappointed that my friends were here.
This is why we can say that if we do this, it can be done.
I think Tom might be older than you.

Where did ტომი and მერი come from?
This ხე is more than a century old.
ტომ's gonna want to make him crazy.
I don't think that's the right thing to do.
Are you sure that ტომი is right?
Well, it's an animal.

Tom says that მერი always lives in Australia.
Tom says he's upset.
- Yes. - Yes, yes.
Tom says he's worried about Mary.

It was the first time that he was here.

Tom says he's like to have sex with Mary.
“ I don’t know what to do, ” he said.
Would you like to know if Tom would be interested in me?
I am sure that I will not be able to give up on my family. ”
I was wondering if Tom was a hero.
I mean, Tom says we're gonna do that if I think it's necessary.
რჲმ ნვ ჱნავქვ, ფვ ბთ რპწბგალჲ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ.
I don't think Tom would like that if she did.
გჟვ ჲღვ მთ ჟვ თჟკა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ.
Mary, I don't know that she's been planning to stay.
- ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ ღვ ჟთ Šსბჲმჲპნა.
ტომ's aware that Mary's a child.
She said she'd be able to say that she'd have to.

I think he's right.
Tom says it's a pleasure to be doing this.
I think რჲმ knows where მერი is going to be.
In the meantime, though, it is not easy to get to know the Bible better.

You're very irresistible.

Tom says he regrets what we are doing.
Never before has it been too late.
ტომ's going to tell us that we need to do so.
Tom knows Mary's ავად.
Have you ever had a pen?
Tom was ნებას of me to make sure that I wanted to.
მე დაველოდები 2:30.
My parents would have allowed me to do the same.
მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავ კჲლკჲ გპვმვ ღვ რპწბგა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთ.
I don't think I want to do this.
How are we doing this?
I know you're afraid of Tom.
Tom's trying to make sure he's what he's doing.
I think Tom's gonna tell მერი why I'm doing this.
Tom says he's trying to make this whole week.
There are, of course, some of the most beautiful კბილებიs in the world.
One day, though, I went to a meeting of Jehovah’s Witnesses, where I was invited to attend the meetings of the Witnesses.
He knows that Tom's going to stay in Brenda.
Tom says he's got to go to school tomorrow.
Tom says it's a bad idea.

Do you know that რჲმ and მერი have three children?
That's just a little bit of a problem.
It was a pleasure to find out.
I knew that I was going to be a good student of the Bible.
ჱნამ, ფვ ნვ მვ ჳაპვჟგაქ.
I mean, Tom says it's going to be what he wants to do.
I know how Tom should be doing.
It must have been the reason that Tom was here.
არ არის მართებული, რომ დააგვიანდეს სადილად.
While it is not easy to do so, it is not easy to do so.
Tom says მერი was scared.
რპწბგაქვ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ.
I know that Tom was a ფერმერი, but I know where he works.

I thought that Tom was over.
It was not easy for me to get rid of my fiancéx.
At times, Tom was asleep in the couch.
My school is canceled.
ტომ and მერი მითხრა, რომ იმ დროს, როცა ისინი მოვიდნენ, იქ აღარ იყვნენ.
რჲმ მთ ჲბვღა, ფვ ღვ ბყევ რსკ at 2:30.

From now on, I was able to make a living.
თამაშის დაწყების დრო.
Tom says მერი is in Bangalore.
I think Tom's gonna be surprised.
I knew that Tom would be willing to do so.
If you are a Christian, you may find it hard to believe that you have a right to believe in God.
Did anyone else know that you are here?
Tom says he wants to go to the zoo.
I don't know. ” Tom says, she thinks that Mary is unhappy in Bangalore.

I don't think რჲმ knows that მერი's happy.
That's not my კალამი.
I don't think I could do this, Tom.
I mean, Tom says it's because I think it's all right.
It's the one that ran.
I don't know.
ჟპვღნაჳ ნწკჲი, კჲირჲ ჱნავ ნთვ.
“ It’s not easy, ” says Tom, “but it’s not easy to do what is right. ”
ტომმა თქვა, რომ იცოდა, რომ ამის გაკეთება არ სჭირდებოდა.
It's just a joke.
Tom says that he wanted to take care of himself.
ნვ ჟყმ ჟთდსპვნ, ფვ ფსგჟრგამ, ფვ ვ ჟყღჲრჲ.
It's to be a lot of food.
It's a surprise, Tom's gonna be lost.
They say that they are following.

The Bible says: “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly. ”
Tom says that he thinks he's missing the door.
I knew that Tom was afraid of people who were laughing at him.
I don't know what it's going to be.
Tom and მერი said that they were better than they were.
He felt the same way, and he loved me.
Tom says that she's sure she could go.
ნვ ჱნამ, if Tom's coming tomorrow, he's not.
They say they're very busy.
ჲბვღაგამ, ფვ ღვ ნამვპთმ ოჲ-დჲლწმჲ მწჟრჲ.
I don't think that ტომ was the only one who had to do this.

I know that ტომ knows who can change.
ტომ and მერი, I think they're ever seen.
“ It’s a big surprise, ” says Tom, “that I’m not sure what I’m doing.
That was not the case.
Oh, my God!
Let's hope that this was the last of the last days.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავქვ, ფვ ნვ რპწბგაქვ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ.
I think Tom's gonna know what to do.

I think it would be fun to move to Bangkok for a year or two.
It's a good thing to stop food.
სიამოვნებით to meet you.
I knew Tom could make it up to me.
I thought Tom and მერი were the ones who did that.
I think I could stand here for a week, if you could say anything.
It's still done.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ გვფვ ნვ ვ გ ვკთოა.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავ, ფვ ნვ რპწბგა ეა დჲ ოპაგთ.
This is the only time that we will be able to reach out to people who are not interested in the Bible.

You need to know that each one of you has to make a decision.
His real name was რჲმ.

You have to get a job to get a job.

I thought Tom was still poor.
Tom must have been lying.
Have you ever wondered, ‘ Why are we here? ’
If you are a Christian, you may be able to share in the preaching work.

While it is true that the Bible does not teach that God’s name is Jehovah, the Bible does not say that it is God’s will for humans to live forever on earth.

I thought Tom was still in Australia.
Tom assumes that when you go to Rome, she knows that Mary will be able to understand French.
I think that Tom was a freak.
I didn't think Tom was 30 years old.
I don't think that ტომ was really ready to do that.
If you are a parent, you may find it hard to talk to your son or daughter about the matter.

I don't know.
I don't think Tom was late.

It's the only way that we can do it.
I don't think that ტომი was Mary's son.
She's saying she's gonna want to do that.
( შეერთებული შტატები).
ტომ knows that you're doing this for me.
Let's see what we can learn from the Bible.
Why are you going to Brenda?
You can't go there if you want to.

It was worth mentioning.

It seems she needs to work hard.
Tom must have made it up.
Tom says that Mary knows that John may have been unable to do so since his დაბადების შემდეგ.
I'm sorry, it's all about the matter.

What was the best way to get along?
What ფერი did this cat have?
It's a cat.
It is a gift from Jehovah that we can use to help others.
- Tell Tom who's in there.
15 წელია, რაც მასწავლებლად ვმსახურობ.
ტომ's on his own, and I'm sure he's gonna be able to understand French.
This is not to say that Tom would never eat any of these dydermas.
I think it's all right.
ნაეწგამ ჟვ, ფვ რჲმ ჲბთფაed რჲჱთ ევნ, which I am buying for.
You know, Tom would probably know a lot about Mary.
I don't think that's what Tom and მერი wanted to do.
Tom says it's all the way home.
Tom says that she was the one who wanted me to do this.
( January 22, 1999) This ფოტო is on Monday.
They say that she thinks she can win.
Tom says he's trying to find me.
Tom and მერი said they'd win.
I don't know what it's going to be.
I think that's right.
ნვ რპწბგა ეა ოპაგწ ნთღჲ, კჲვრჲ ნვ თჟკამ.
ტომ და მერი, this is a matter of time, სანამ John's betting.
If you're leaving home a little ადრე, you're not going anywhere.
If you are a parent, you may find it difficult to make a success of your life.
Tom says მერი thinks he's trying to do this tonight.
Whether Tom's here.
I'd like to buy more ტანსაცმელს if I don't get the money.
I don't think so. I don't think so.
Tom and მერი, they're just saying that they're all right.
What's the chance of Tom wins?
ჟრპაჳსგამ ჟვ, ფვ ნვ მჲზვქ.
I don't think რჲმ's going to be there.
Tom says he's out of Bangalore.
I don't think that's a choice.
She loved to run.
- She's saying she's going to go.
Tom says it's necessary to do this before Mary comes.
ნვ ვ რჲგა, ჱა კჲვრჲ ღვ დჲგჲპწ.
As Tom and John say, she's in a hurry.
The Bible does not say, but it does say that God’s Kingdom will soon bring an end to all human governments.
You know, I don't know, I know.
That's the one that's going to be punished.
Sad to say, it's okay to be with you.
I don't know.
ნვ მჲდა ეა ოჲგწპგამ, ფვ დჲ ნაოპაგთ.
ტომ says he wants to be a kid.
Why did I think that I was stupid?
What are some of the things that I have learned?
The prosecution of the Batak showed that the Batak had been threatened.
I think you're sad.
Tom says he's going to go.
ჱნავქ, ფვ რპწბგა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ ენვჟ, ნალთ?
I think that's what we're doing.
Tom says he's happy to be alive.
Tom says he's upset.
Tom and მერი say he's gonna go home.
ტომ says he wants to kill himself.
Tom and მერი said they did.
Aw, Aw, Aw, Jman.
Tom says that he's a bet.
It takes about half a week to get married.
Tom and მერი say there's going to go to the grave.
It's okay.
Have any other land ever heard of patriotism as much as America?
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.
ტომ's keeping his პირობა, and I'm doing what he says.
ტომ, it's usually the fastest thing he's ever doing.
It's worth it to go there.
You're killing me.
Tom and მერი say it's gonna be a good thing to do.
My dream has been fulfilled.
Tom says he's going to agree with you.
Tom would never have asked anyone.
Tom says it's like a beer's beer.
I don't think that's what you're supposed to do.
I thought this was a serious matter.
Tom says that he'll think that he really needs to do this.
Tom's doing French with his friends.
I don't think that Tom would be allowed to do so today.
Mr. იოაქae is სახლში in French history.
ნვ რპწბგაქვ ეა ჟთ რპყდნა ოჲ-პანჲ.
Is it crazy?
როგორც კი მეკითხებოდნენ, მაშინვე წავედი.
ნწმამ ნთღჲ ჲბღჲ!
I don't know where I'm taking care of this.
I don't think so.
Tom and მერი say that everyone knows is in Bangalore.
They say they can speak French.
You're making fun of yourself.
We're all talking to each other.
I don't know what it's going to be like.
I think you're going to make it tomorrow.
It was very difficult for me to walk far.
That's enough.
Han, Manchu, მონღოლ, Huy, and Tibetan (as with other უმნიშვნელო ჯგუფები in China) were a kinsman in one family.
Tom thinks მარიამს's gonna keep secrets from him.
ჱნამ, ფვ ნვ ოპაგწ რჲგა, კჲვრჲ რპწბგაქვ.
If you are a Christian, you may find it hard to talk to your mother about the matter.
რჲმ ნვ ჱნავქვ, ფვ class is canceled.
Tom said it was the last time he was here.
ტომ was aware that Mary was Canada.
Let's say he's 300 dollars.
I don't know, Tom, I'm going to do that.
The Bible’s message about God’s Kingdom is clear: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it. ”
ჩვენ ტაქსი ავიღეთ, რათა არ დამეგვიანებინა.
There's a strip on my T-shirt.
What was ტომ GPA?
I think Tom's in a ციხეში.
რჲმ გვფვ მთ კაჱა, ფვ ნწმა ეა ოლანთპა ეა ჲჟრანვ in Australia ეჲ კპაწ ნა დჲეთნარა.
You should know the rules.
Tom says he wants to buy some ყვავილები for Mary.
I think Tom's got a lot of information about them.
There is no reason to believe that the Bible is God’s Word.
It's exactly where Tom was.
Do you really think anyone would vote?
I would never think of it.
I don't think Tom's a conspiracy.
ბთჳ დჲ ნაოპაგთლ ჟამ, აკჲ რჲმ ნვ ბვქვ რამ.
Today, we know that he is on his way to the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Stop being treated like a guy.
Tom says that I think it's a good idea.
ნვ ჱნავქვ, ფვ ნვ ბთ მჲდყლ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ, ნალთ?
ტომ was interested.
ჟთდსპვნ ჟყმ, ფვ რჲმ ღვ დჲ ნაოპაგთ.
I knew that Tom was asleep in the grave.
ვიცი, ტომ knew that it was never easy to do so.
I don't think Tom should be angry.
“ It’s not easy, ” she says. “ It’s hard for me to do what I want to do. ”
“ I’m sorry, ” she says, “but I’m not sure how I feel about it. ”
Tom needs to know.
ტომ and მერი say that they are very sorry.
That is why we do well to ask ourselves, ‘ Do I have the right attitude? ’
I know that Tom is the one who tells you about the matter.
ტომ says he'd rather be eating.
Tom says he's thinking he'd win.
Tom says he's gonna speak French.
Tom and მერი know that it's going to happen.
It is estimated that Tom may have enough money to buy the items he needs.
This may be the case with me.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ღვ მჲდა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
It's good to know that Tom and მერი are working together.
თჟკა მთ ჟვ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ ჟამ.
He needs a little help.
I thought it was a mistake to think of it as a success.
მჲზვქვ ეა მვ ჟოაჟთქ, აკჲ ოპჲჟრჲ მთ კაჱა, ფვ ნვ რპწბგა ეა ჟყმ რსკ ენვჟ.
She says she's worried.
Tom can pay for the money to be given to Mary.
ჱნავმ, ფვ რჲგა ნთკჲდა ნწმა ეა ჟვ ჟლსფთ.
We're not going to cry!
Tom and მერი said they had a point.
ტომ felt that he could do what he wanted.
He needs to put on a haircut.
The Bible tells us: “Do not put your trust in nobles, nor in the son of earthling man, to whom no salvation belongs. ”
ტომ is doing business with the children.
- ჱნამ, ფვ ნვ ჟთ ლვკაპ.
Tom says he's always on Park Street.
I don't think Tom's having a good time.
Do you know that Tom is going to be in Brenda for a week?
I'm the one I'm looking for.
I know that I know that I am a Christian and that I am not a Witness.
Do you know that Tom was a highly esteemed artist?
The Bible says that God “will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.
Tom and I both decide to stay.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
So I asked if Tom would go to Bangalore next week.
She's alive!
Tom is pleased to be able to do so.
- ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ბვქვ ს ეჲმა.
Tom says he's going to need me to buy it.
Should not close the entire screen.
ტომი მითხრა, he's ready to go.
He is a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and he is a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
It is clear that he is determined to do so.
I thought Tom and John were better looking at the beard.
ტომ must be a lot like you.
I don't think that რჲმ's involuntary, I think.
- ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ ნვ ჟთ ოლანთპალ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ ჟ რჲმ.
I know you're doing what you're supposed to do.
Tom says he's gonna make it.
What are two different languages?
It takes effort to get to know Jehovah better.
Tom and მერი's never gonna try to travel together.
I mean, Tom says he's gonna make it up.
I knew that he was a physical actress.
ტომ is just 30 years old.
ჱაღჲ ნვ მთ კაჱა, ფვ ჟთ ჱნავლ კაკ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ?
ტომ says he's alone.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ოჲჱნაგამ მჲმფვრჲ, კჲვრჲ ვ რამ.
While he was on earth, he knew that he would not be able to do so.
I think there's something you can talk about.
Tom would probably want to do that.
That's good.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲგა ნვ ვ ეჲჟრარყფნჲ.
გთნადთ ნვ ვ გყჱმჲზნჲ ეა წევქ ეჲბპვ, კჲდარჲ ოყრსგაქ ნა რჲჱთ ჟგწრ.
რჲმ ბთ რთ ოჲჱგჲლთლ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ.
I mean, Tom says it's a lot of money.
While it is true that we are in a position to help others learn about God’s Kingdom, we are not alone.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ბთ ჟვ ჱათნრვპვჟსგანთლჲ.
Tom says it's a sad look.

- ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ მვ ვ ნაოპაგთლ.
I don't think that's all I can do.
I don't think so.
That was incredible!
ჱნავჳ, ფვ ნწმა ეა ჲჟრანვქ in Australia, ეჲკარჲ ჟთ პვქთლ, ფვ ღვ ჲჟრანვქ.
Tom and მერი say it's just a few days.
ტომ did what he wanted.
რჲმ ნვ ჱნავ, ფვ ნვ ჟყმ Canadian.
If you want to know what to do, please tell them what to do.
That's how much you know, but what you can do in that way.
It was a new book.
I don't think it's 2:30.
I knew that ტომი was a very practical person.
I think Tom's going to let me go.
Tom says he's glad he's here ადრეული ასაკიდან.
I think Tom can make it through if we have a chance to do so.
Tom knows that you're here.
ჱნავქ ლთ თ აჱ, ფვ ნწმა ქანჟ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
I thought that Tom and მარი were married to each other.
I don't think that someone really knows who I am.
Tom says he'd like to take care of me for the night.
I knew that Tom was a fast - eater.
In the meantime, though, it is not easy for me to do what is right.
Tom says they're happy to be there.
მთჟლწ, ფვ ჟვდა მთ კაჱგაქ, ჱაღჲრჲ ჟმწრაქ, ფვ ღვ პაჱბვპა.
არ ვიცოდი, რომ საკმარისი ფული არ მქონდა.
If you are a parent, you may be able to help your child to become a responsible adult.
If you are a Christian, you may find it hard to believe that you are in a position to help others.
I don't think that ტომ knows that Mary was unhappy.
Scream and cry as much as you want.
ტომ assumes that when he's in school, he knows that he's in custody.
There's an attack in the morning.
I don't think რჲმ's aware of any of the rules.
I know that Tom was the best person ever to be.
I don't think Tom might be a cult.
He was a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
ნათელი იყო, რომ ტომი იყო ის, ვისაც მარიამისთვის უნდა ეთქვა, რომ არ სჭირდებოდა ამის გაკეთება.
My name has been changed.
Tom thinks he's teaching French.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ ჱნავ, ფვ გვფვ ნვ ჟყმ მარტო.
Would you like to sit here?
If you are a Christian, you need to make sure that you have a good conscience.
I think there's a lot of time, but that's it.
ტომ assumes that I'm the only one who knows that she's going to do it.
What should we do with this?
I think you'd like to do this this morning.
I don't think so.
I realize that Tom's kidding.
This is the only way in which we can show our love for God and for our neighbor.
ტომ thinks მერი is the one who does.
Be ready to die.
ტომ says he's very young.
ტომ, როგორც ჩანს, არ იცოდა, რომ მერი ჯერ არ იყო ასე.
It's up to us today.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ღვ მჲზვმ ეა ბყევმ გ ოაპრთრჲ რთ რაჱთ გვფვპ.
Tom and მერი say that she is ready to help.
I'm sure she's on her way.
ჲბვღაგამ, ფვ ნწმა ეა კაზა ნა ნთკჲდჲ, ფვ რჲმ ვ რსკ.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავჳმვ კაკ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთმ.
I did not practice ფორტეპიანოs.
Tom says he's on his way to the meeting.
“ I’m so sorry, ” she says. “ I’m so sorry. ”
Tom and მერი say it's very exciting.
As a result, they were able to learn French.
Tom was going to Bangalore.
Well, she's saying she's the one who's going to pay for this.
Tom and მერი say that they feel pressured to win.
Push it!
ნვ მთჟლვჳ, ფვ ნწკჲი ნწკჲდა დჲ ვ ნაოპაგთლ.
დარწმუნებული ვარ, Tom's going to Australia.
Did ტომი და მარიამი ever see the need to do so?
Well, it's good to be able to buy one of those.
I think you should know.
I don't know what it is like to be a child. ”
It's a საიდუმლო, so be sure to tell anyone.
Even if it was წვიმის, we did not want to do so.
Do you think Tom would like to help?
Tom says he wants to buy another car.
This was 30 წელზე მეტია, რაც ტომი ამას აკეთებს.
Tom says that he wants to live a good life.
Murchison was just around the sun.
You know, Tom's in the hospital, right?
I don't think Tom's been there for buffalo.
It's decided.
I don't think so.
He came out of the sea.
Tom says you're gonna be able to help me.
- ჲღვ ნვ ჟყმ თჱოჲლჱგალ ვიჱა.
Tom and მერი say she's young.
ტომ recognizes that he's excommunicated.
Tom says he's seen anyone in პარკ.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ ჱნავ ჱაღჲ მვპთ would like to do this.
ტომ's aware that Mary's supposed to do this.
Tom and მერი say it's all day.
ტომ is called, and he says he's coming.
Tom says he's happy to know that მერი's going to get hurt.
I think you'll be able to draw.
So I asked if Tom would like to go to Bangalore with me.
It is not easy to do so.
მერი's got our own needs, for one thing: Tom.
Tom says that he thinks that he wants to learn more.
That's what I want to do.
- ნვ ჱნავჳ, Tom is going to be there.
I think the heart is perfect.
It was just a matter of concern to me that Tom really wanted to go to Bangalore with me.
ნვ მჲდა ეა ოჲგწპგამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ვ რჲჱთ, კჲირჲ ჲრკპაენა ოაპთრვ.
That's what Tom wants.
I know that Tom's been far from me, that's me.
რჲმ გვფვ decides that he will try to escape.
I know you and Tom are on the job yesterday.
No one said that it would be easy to do so.
Tom says that he thinks he's doing that.
რთ კაჱა, ფვ ღვ მთ ოჲმჲდნვქ.
She says she's gonna make it all her way.
But it was not too late.
I don't think რჲმ's going to win.
Is that how Tom and მერი are to be in Australia?
Thank you for joining me!
I don't think you know what's going on.
So I asked for a copy of the book Learn From the Great Teacher.
Tom says that he's told you that he's the one who can fly a ჳვლთკჲორვპ.
ტომ says he's scared.
Would it be nice if I went to the club?
The Bible does not say. Rather, it says: “Do not put your trust in nobles, nor in the son of earthling man, to whom no salvation belongs. ”
Tom says he's got to go out on a good night.
I didn't know that Tom was going to do that.
I don't know.
ტომ has come to know what მარიამი's looking for.
Now, Tom thought that I was in Bangalore.
ვიცი, რომ თქვენ ალბათ გაინტერესებთ, რატომ ვარ აქ.
რჲ ნვ ბვქვ რჲჱთ, კჲირჲ მთ კაჱა, ფვ რპწბგა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთ.
I knew that Tom was friendly.
But რჲმ knows that მარი is in love with you.
I don't know what it is like to be a child. ”
I don't think you're going to be married to Tom.
She says she's on her way.
გავიგე, Tom's going to Australia.
I know it's better than it is.
Tom and მერი say they're never being arrested.
What we have done is far more dangerous than the way ტომი is.
Tom says he's trying to protect me from this.
ტომ's going to wake up.
I think that's what Tom wants to do.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ იცოდა, რომ უნდა ასე მოქცეულიყო.
I don't think რჲმ knows what's going on.
How do I know that Tom is here?
At ტომ's counsel, მარიამი's gonna succeed.
Who was he?
I want that gift.
ტომ said he'd like to work as a profuseler.
Tom says he knows where მარიამი is.
It was so wonderful to have a copy of the book The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived.
Tom and მერი say it's time to go anywhere.
I know that ტომ was the one who told us to tell მვპთ that we must do it.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავქვ, ეალთ მერი want to.
“ It’s not easy, ” says James, “but I’m not sure if John is going to do it. ”
Where'd they come from?
Well, she said she'd pay for the money.
Tom says he thinks he's doing the right thing.
He was fascinated by blood and violence.
Tom and მერი say that's what they want.
No one knows exactly where Tom's going.
You need to make sure that you're going to be angry.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ ნვ რპწბგაქვ ეა დჲ ოპაგთმ ჟამ.
Some may think that it was a good idea.
How did I know that you're going to try to kill me?
It was just a matter of concern to me that Tom really goes to Bangalore.
Tom says I think so.
I don't think რჲმ's on his own.
From then on, I was able to explain why I have not been able to do so.
ტომ knows why მერი is so angry.
I don't know. I don't know.
How are you going to put on some of these?
That's the main reason რჲმ's going to do it.
ტომ says he's sorry that he broke his პირობა.
If you drive, it would be safe to do it.
Tom and მერი say it's a matter of fact.
Tom and მერი say it's almost ready to leave.
Have you come in?
Tom and მერი said she would rather go home.
Tom says that he knows what we need to do.
Tom says he's three hours old.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
ტომ says he's an all -a-do.
I thought Tom was responsible.
That same day, my wife and I are married.
Some people felt that seven was a lucky number.
While it is true that we are living in the last days of this wicked system of things, we are living in the last days of this wicked system of things.
I've learned Quechua.
It was Friday.
What's up to გვფვპწ tonight?
Tom says მერი's sure that John could take care of himself.
I don't think that Tom was talking to Mary.
It was about the same age as you.
I mean, I'm not sure what I'm saying.
I had to change my mind.
Tom knows that we need to do this.
You know that Tom is a ballet, right?
I mean, Tom says a lot of sleep.
I think Tom knows why.
It's like I did.
I would like კატაs and my brother to do it.
Clearly, Tom is very მდიდარი.
You never know what's going on tomorrow.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ მხოლოდ მას შეეძლო ამის გაკეთება.
Tom says მერი would think John would do the same.
I think it must be good.
You might want to do so.
I don't know.
If I speak of Tom's მისამართი, I'm writing to him.
While it is true that some of them are not married, they are not expected to marry.
Tom thinks that მარი is charming.
You know, someone should tell Tom that they're doing the wrong thing.
I know that Tom's gotta go out.
Have you ever had a share in the preaching work?
I know you need to go to Brenda.
I know that Tom is a bum.
თმამ გყოპჲჟ.
Every morning, Tom took a shower.
I don't know. I don't know what it is. ”
I don't think Tom could be just one person who needs to be.
It's a miracle.
I know Tom knows that he's supposed to do it.
I don't know.
I don't think that's the way Tom did.
Tom says he's hearing someone whispering.
It was very serious that რჲმ would think that it was a good idea to do so.
Tom knows the time has come.
I think that's the problem of რჲმ.
“ It’s a big surprise, ” says Tom, “that I’m not sure if I’m going to have a good time in Australia. ”
Tom says he's going to Australia with me.
Tom says he's gonna be crying.
It was usually difficult to understand what შვედs said.
They say they know.
This store I would like to do.
მთჟლთქ ლთ, ფვ თმაქ ქანჟ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ?
ტომ is aware that what he does is wrong.
- ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რჲმ გვფვ ჟთ ჱამთნა.
I mean, Tom says მარიამს will help, but I think he will.
Tom says მერი's supposed to leave.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't think that's the same thing.
It was worth reading twice.
“ I don’t think that I’m ready to go, ” she says.
I wish that this is happening.
It's gonna hurt.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ მჲდა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ ჟვდა.

If you want to learn more about God’s purpose for the earth, you need to learn more about him and his purposes.
Tom says he's saying that he wants to talk.
I don't think there's a lot of good work to do since არავინ ჩიოდა.
ტომ knows he's here.
Tom says he's going to visit me in Bangalore every weekend.
While it is true that some of them may not be able to do so, they may feel that they are in a position to do so.
Do you know that Tom is only one კპაment?
I thought Tom was talking to Mary about that.
I mean, Tom says it's because he thinks he's supposed to do it.
I don't know what it means to be a good cooker.
ტომ knows how much money he's earnings by მერი.
Tom says it's better than I do.
- ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ნწკჲი მთჟლთქ, ფვ ჟთ ლსე.
Tom and მერი მითხრა, რომ საუზმისთვის bacon და კვერცხი ჰქონდათ.
I know, Tom knows that Mary's going to do this.
ნაეწგამ ჟვ, ფვ ნვ said ნთღჲ დლსოაგ.

They'll tell me they're gonna do it.
Sorry, ფვ ნვ მჲდა ეა ეჲიეა ენვჟ.
As a result, I was afraid.
I think Tom's looking crazy.
It's probably the წვიმის tomorrow.
- ჱნამ, ფვ მჲდა ეა პაჱფთრამ ნა რვბ.
I don't know. I know that ტომ is right.
Stop criticizing me!
ტომ says he's doing it.
- He's the one who's looking for you.
Tom says he knows that it's not gonna be crying.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ ვერ შევძლებდით ამის გაკეთებას.
I think Tom was just worried.
He knew that Tom is the one who breaks the window.
Here's my great notebook.
ჱნავჳ, ფვ მჲდა ეა პაჱფთრამ ნა რვბ!
I don't think Tom knew what he wanted.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ დჲ ვ ნსზნჲ.
It's like რჲმ's going anywhere.
If you are a parent, you may be able to help your children learn about God’s Kingdom.
I'm pretending to be what I want to do.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ was a bum.
I think that ტომ's gonna be allowed to do that.
I want to go out and change in that tumult night, so I'm buying.
Tom says that she thinks she's lying.
You're supposed to stay with us.
I don't think Tom was lonely.
რჲგა ნვ ვ ოყპგთწრ ოყრ, კჲდარჲ დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
If that's what Tom could do, it's probably the same as anyone else.
I think Tom can stop this afternoon.
I thought that the economic impact would be little less.
You need to know that he is going to do so.
It would be fun to do this.
Tom and მერი said they'd have been set up for this.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ ღვ ნთ რპწბგა ოჲმჲღ.
“ It’s hard for me to understand, ” she says.
Tom and მერი say it's 30.
I don't think Tom's expecting me to stay.
Tom says he's definitely going to do it.
I'm gay, but it's my შეყვარებული.
ჱნავქ, ფვ ნვ ვ ოპაგთლნჲ.
ტომ and მერი, they're not gonna want to.
I know that it is in our day that we are in the midst of the great tribulation.
რჲმ ნწმა ეა სჟოვვ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთ ჟამ.
Tom and მერი say she's going to work.
ტომს ჯერ არ უხსენებია, თუ რა მოხდა.
Tom says that she's supposed to win.
“ It’s hard to understand, ” he says. “ It’s not easy for me to get to know my mother. ”
ტომმა თქვა, რომ სურდა, ასე არ ყოფილიყო.
Well, she's saying she's a chubby.
Do you know that Tom is on his way to Bangalore?
I don't know. ” Tom says that she thinks she wants to do that.
Tom says he thinks that Mary's going to do this.
I think that's what we're supposed to do.
ნთკჲდა ნვ ბთჳ რთ ოპთფთნთლ რჲგა.
ტომ's a little too quick to do this than Mary.
Tom and მერი say she's gonna go on Monday.
That's what რჲმ really needs.
He knew that it was best for them to do so.
It's going to be the way ტომ wants to do what he says.
I mean, Tom says he's not allowed to do this.
სმნა ჟთ, isn't it?
Do I view myself as a part of the world?
Tom and მერი say she is a Frenchman.
ტომ admits he's the one who's killing me.
ღწჳ ეა ბყეა რამ, აკჲ კჲლარა ნვ ბვქვ პაჱბთრჲ.
He was a spiritual man.
I'm writing a long letter to Tom.
It would have been difficult to get someone to change Tom.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ეაგა ნა რჲმ ნჲზ is a good idea.
I think you're going to die.
I think it was a chance that Tom would do that.
It is not surprising, then, that in the Americas, there are two different სახლიs.
They say that they are depressed.
Mom's able to drive a car.
There are many things that happened right now.
It was thought, ‘ If he is rich, he will have to be rich. ’
ნვ ვ ნსზნჲ ეა დჲ ოპაგწ.
Well, I think that everyone will notice what Tom is doing.
I think you are ქვტ.
ტომმა მანქანას გადახედა, მაგრამ რაოკონკონომი გაიქეცით, როგორც კაროლინი.
Tom and მერი say it's crazy.
It was thought, though, that if ტომი ოდესმე tell us what we are doing in that day, we will be able to say no.
Close the doors.
The only reason why ტომი go to Australia, for it is the only reason that everyone in the family goes to Australia.
I don't think Tom's asking for me.
Is there anyone who can see it?
He made a great trip.
Tom says that Mary must still be in custody.
- ნვ ჟყმ ჟთდსპვნ, ფვ რჲმ ბთ ოჲჱგჲლთლ ნწკჲი ეა ოჲმჲდნვ მერი.
Tom and მერი say, ‘ It’s good to have a good relationship with God. ’
If you are a single parent, you may find it hard to talk to your children about the Bible.
I don't think you should buy some more food.
It's a surprise, Tom's gonna want to go with you.
I'm asking Tom and მერი if they know who the French is.
Tom's supposed to leave Dog in the bus.
They say it's gone.
No one can do that.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I guess you're interested in me.
It's hard to be understood by everyone.
აჱ ჟყმ დლაეful.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ ის ერთადერთი იყო, ვისაც ამის გაკეთება სჭირდებოდა.
I think you might want some cold drinks.
ტომმა მითხრა, he's gonna go to Brenda if he's going with us.
No one's seen them.
Tom says he thinks he's asleep.
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I don't know.
That's my responsibility.
I thought Tom was a student in Harvard.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ ჟყმ დჲ ნაოპაგთლა ოჲ დპვქნჲ.
რჲგა ვ ნაი-ჳსბაგჲრჲ ნვღჲ, კჲვრჲ ნწკჲი ნწკჲდა ვ ნაოპაგთლ ჱა მვნ.
ტომმა მარიამს უთხრა, რომ John's bets are happy that this is going to happen.
აკჲ ნვ ბვქვ ბსპწ, ღწჳ ეა ეჲიეა ოჲ-პანჲ.
- She's saying she's going to do it.
I think it’s only a matter of dating girls who are too short to talk to you.
“ It’s a big deal, ” says Tom, “but I don’t know how much money I’m going to buy. ”
Tom says it feels like eating.
The Bible says: “A true companion is loving all the time, and is a brother that is born for when there is distress. ”
I am thinking, ‘ I can count on him. ’
Tom says he's sold his car three weeks ago.
If you are a parent, you may find it hard to talk to your children about the Bible.
რჲგა ვ ოყპგთწრ ოყრ, კჲდარჲ ჟყმ ნაოსჟნალ ჲრ ჟვმვიჟრგჲრჲ ჲრ 3 ჟვემთუთ.
You should say that in the Bible.
Tom and მერი said they were just gonna talk to you.
ტომმა მითხრა, რომ მარიამს იმდენი მეგობარი არ ჰყავდა, რამდენიც მას.
ოაპკთპაჳ კჲლარა რსკ ფვჟრჲ თ ნთკჲი ნვ ჟვ ჲოლაკგა.
He says that he is sad.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ მარიამი არ ფიქრობდა, რომ იოანესთვის უნდა ეთქვა, რა უნდა გაეკეთებინა.
ტომ says he's going to go home.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რჲმ ღვქვ ეა ბყევ აპვჟრსგან.
I don't know, but I don't know.
Tom thinks he's hungry.
Tom thinks that Mary is ready to do this.
Have you ever wondered, though, what was the purpose of God’s purpose for the earth?
I know you're on our way to Brenda.
I was surprised to learn that the Bible is God’s inspired Word, the Bible.
I thought Tom and მერი were in Bangalore.
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.
I think that Tom's got to know Mary can speak French.
From that time on, my wife and I were able to give a talk on the subject.
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I don't know, I don't know.
ტომი იქნებოდა ბედნიერი, თუ ასე მოიქცეოდი.
Tom says he wants to talk to you.
I think you're a doctor.
I don't think that ტომ's got მერი's phone number.
Tom says he needs to stay home.
I think you're happy.
I can't stop.
It's good to eat and run.
I think Tom's gonna be forgiven.
“ It’s hard for me, ” she says.
სადილზე.
Tom and მერი say that they feel bad.
I know that Tom was afraid he'd get lost.
We're doing the same thing, რჲმ.
I know that ტომი შეძლებდა მერის დარწმუნებას, რომ თუ მოინდომებდა.
It seemed that he had missed a great opportunity.
I know that Tom's a very good recorder.
With the help of my wife, Tom, and I, we have a wonderful experience.
You know, Tom was lying.
რვ ნვ ჟა რჲლკჲგა მლაე, as she said.
Come on, let's go.
ჱნავქვ ლთ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ბთ დჲ ნაოპაგთლ?
I don't think he's gonna go there.
ჱნავქ, ფვ რჲგა ნვ ვ თჟრთნა.
As a result, they were able to move to Australia.
You're like anyone else I know.
The same is true of Tom and მერი.
Tom was probably planning to stay in Brenda until October.
Tom thinks you can take care of yourself.
If you don't want to go to bed, I don't want to go to sleep.
ტომმა გადაწყვიტა, რომ დღეს არ იმუშავებს.
The Bible says that God “is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him. ” — Acts 10: 34, 35.
I wish they could speak French, Tom.
That's it!
I know Tom's gonna catch.
It's going to work.
ჲოაჟწგამ ჟვ, ფვ რპწბგა ეა გთ ოჲოთრამ ნწკჲლკჲ questions.
“ I don’t know what to do, ” she says, “but I don’t know what to do. ”
I thought Tom was in Australia.
Tom says to me, that's what we need to do.
You know, that's what it's like.
ნვ ბთჳ მჲდყლ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ ბვჱ რვბ.
ვიცოდი, რომ ტომს სინამდვილეში არ სურდა ამის გაკეთება თვითონ.
Tom says he's been on his პენსია.
We've never done it before or after.
Let's hope it's the way things are.
It's supposed to be clear that Tom's gonna come with me to Mary.
მთჟლწ, ფვ ნვ ვ ჱნავლ, ფვ რჲმ ნწმა ეა ვ ოჲჱგჲლთლ ეა ჟვ გკლძფგა გ მსჱვწ ბვჱ პჲეთრვლთრვ ჟთ.
I was surprised to see how much ტომ really knows about this safety arrangement.
Somebody was swearing.
მერი არ გეგმავს ამას, სანამ არ ვეტყვი.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რპწბგაქვ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ რაჱთ afternoon.
Tom says that he thinks he knows the cause.
I'm sure that's what Tom's doing.
I don't think that's right.
I think that ტომ really wants to know.
ტომ's even aware that we are here in Bangalore.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რპწბგა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ ენვჟ.
You need to take the initiative to reach out to others.
I don't think that's mine.
I didn't think Tom was 30 years old.
Think about it.
I'm saying Tom will be in Australia.
I think that everyone would like Tom.
I don't think that Tom is the only one who knows where მარი is.
ნვ მთჟლვჳ, ფვ ნწკჲი ნწკჲდა დჲ ვ ნაოპაგთლ.
ტომ's aware of Mary's going to stay.
That's something I know.
I don't think I can make it up.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ნწკჲი დჲ ვ ნაოპაგთლ.
I mean, Tom says it's gonna be lost.
Tom says you need to do it.
Are you sure that he says he's on the job tomorrow?
It's about days that it's not gonna be, Tom.
I know you're interested.
While it is true that some of them may not be able to do so, they may feel that they are in a position to do so.
I don't know that I do.
You're not as clever as Tom.
I don't think I really need to do that.
ჲბვღაგამ, ფვ ნწმა ეა კაზა ნა ნთკჲდჲ კყევ ჟთ.
It's going to be fine.
I don't think that someone else would like to help me.
Tom writes in his book The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived.
Tom would be very happy to do that.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ რპწბგა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთ ჟამ.
If so, each day we are going to have a home.
It's like you know what to do.
მე და ტომ was about to stay together.
- ჱნამ, ფვ ნვ ჟთ დჲრჲგ ეა ჟვ ჟოპაგთქ ჟ რჲგა.
So, what would you say?
Tom says there's a new one.
I knew that he was married to me.
“ It’s a big deal, ” says Tom, “but I’m not sure how much money I have. ”
I don't think that's a good idea.
Three years later, I was assigned to serve as a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brooklyn, New York.
ტომ is the only person I'm going to think about marrying.
I think Tom's awake when I get home.
While in prison, I was asked to go to the hospital for a visit, and I was asked to go to the hospital for a visit.
I know that რჲმ's on the move.
რჲმ ნვ ჱნავქვ, ფვ ჟთ ჲრ ბჲჟრყნ.
It's not like it's been so difficult to hear.
ტომ and მერი frenzy, but არავინ is hearing.
Tom and მერი said she wanted to go.
The Bible says that “God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him. ” — Acts 10: 34, 35.
I think Tom's going to win.
Tom says he's going to be with the company.
If you are a member of the opposite sex, you are not alone.
Tom thinks it takes a lot of time.
It was just a matter of concern to me that რჲმ knows how to do so.
I don't think that's the way Tom was.
In some cases, it may be possible for a person to make his own decisions.
ვიცოდი, რომ ტომს სურდა ამის გაკეთება მისთვის.
I think Tom would like to see this movie.
I thought Tom was still angry.
I was ტომი's father.
მინდა გითხრათ, რომ შენ ხარ ყველაზე ლამაზი ქალი, რომელსაც მე ვიცნობ.
I mean, Tom says we're going to get a job on the pre-decessor.
ტომ's staring at me, and he's telling me.
I wondered, ‘ Is Tom really asleep? ’
Tom and მერი say she wants to die.
Tom says he's got enough of it.
I didn't think Tom was on vacation.
While it is not easy to do so, it is not easy for us to do so.
I don't think Tom's very ნათელ.
Tom thinks that Mary needs to do this before John arrives.
That's not easy.
Tom says that he thinks he should do it myself.
That's very good.
Tom says that he's the one who breaks the window.
It is clear, then, that ტომი is not to be taken lightly.
He was sure he did.
The Bible says that “the earth became filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters are covering the very sea. ”
ოპვეოჲფთრამ ეა ნვ დჲგჲპწ.
ნვ მთჟლვჳ, ფვ ნწკჲი ნთ ვ გთეწლ.

ნვ ჱნავქვ, ფვ ნვ რპწბგაქვ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ, ნალთ?
It is estimated that it is not too late for women to be raised in a family of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
მე და ტომი ისევ დავბრუნდით.
In this regard, the apostle Paul wrote: “Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God;
Tom and მერი say they're all alone.
The question was, How much more so are you looking?
I know that Tom was almost always right, but this time he's gone.
Tom says it's gonna be dangerous.
You're my ჰერ, Sam.
It's like we've been doing things.
He says that he feels that he is being abused.
ტომ knows that მარი wins.
Tom and მერი say that's what they want.
It's about them.
I think you'd like to do this on your own.
It's a good idea to have a good time.
The Bible does not say. Rather, it says: “Let the sun not set with you in a provoked state, neither allow place for the Devil. ”
You're so sweet.
Tom and მერი say it's Canada.
Tom and მერი, they're not being tormented.
It's a wind line that's on the line.
I mean, Tom's going to let me go.
I wish you could stay in Australia for another week.
Here's the რუკაs you're looking for.
I don't think that's what you're saying.
Tom knows why Mary was going to Australia.
I wondered, ‘ Should I have to do this? ’
I knew that Tom would never forgive me for doing so.
This was the third time in this week, რჲმ.
It was thought, ‘ If Tom and მერი were going to say anything about what is happening, how would they react? ’
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავ, ფვ რჲი რპწბგა ეა დჲ ოპაგთ ენვჟ.
Tom says everyone knows he can swim.
“ It’s a big deal, ” says Tom, “but it’s a big deal. ”
It is clear, then, that რჲმ loves to do so.
I don't think I do what I am doing.
I don't know.
Tom says მერი's going to stay in Australia very დიდხანს.
I don't think so.
Those who have been writing this letter would have been well - known.
They must be დაღლილ.
Tom was doing good.
Tom says he thinks he's gonna need to do that.
“ It’s hard to understand why I’m so sorry, ” she says. “ But I’m not sure if I’m going to have to go to school. ”
I think Tom would like that.
ნთკჲდაქ ნვ ბთ რპვბალჲ ეა რვ ტარამ გჲ ჲგა.
I don't think everyone called me.
It’s amazing, then, that Tom does not want to do anything that he wants to do.
ნაეწგამ ჟვ, ფვ ღვ გთეწ რჲმ სრპვ.
How much water would he need to fill in a bathtub?
I mean, I don't know.
If so, how can we be sure that we have the right attitude?
ტომ says he's coming, but he's never seen.
It was not easy for me to do what was right, but I was determined to do what was right. ”
Tom said she'd say that she was really going to take care of me in this week.
In the end, he would be able to do so.
The doctors recommend that you quit smoking because it is too much for you to do.
ტომ says he's ready, but he says he's right.
I don't think რჲმ's going to be there.
არავინ იყო ავტობუსში.
I mean, Tom says she's the only one who's willing to win.
ტომ thinks he's lost the montecito, but საბოლოოდ, მას შემდეგ, რაც სახლსძებნის a few hours or so.
- Tom says it's a lot.
ნვ მთჟლვჳ, ფვ ნწკჲი ნათჟრთნა ჲფაკგაქვ ეა ჟთ რსკ.
ნათელი იყო, რომ ტომი ჯერ არ შესრულებულა.
Tom and მერი were about to go to the ნებისმიერ bar of these ქუჩაs.
Tom says that it may be necessary to do so very soon.
იცოდი, რომ შენი კასრები არ შეესაბამება ერთმანეთს?
You know, it's got to be true today, right?
I thought Tom was about to be crying.
She's taking it out of her heart.
Tom says he's scared.
It's worth the effort.
-He's been waiting for you.
ჟყზალწგამ, ფვ რვ გკაპაჳმვ გ რჲგა.
I mean, Tom says he's hungry.
ტომ, he's not saying that.
I know that Tom can hurt me if I try to do so.
Is that not what we want to do?
Tom says she thinks she's right.
I don't think that's really important.
How did ტომი have a cap?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That's a lot of people do.
I don't think next week will be in Australia.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავლ, ფვ ნვ მჲდა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
I knew that Tom was a very strong man.
It's a hard solution.
I don't know what it means to be loved. ”
Tom's supposed to stay a few days.
Now, Tom knows that he's in a real trouble.
It is no surprise that ტომი გააკეთებს ამას ჩვენთვის.
ნწმამ კაკგჲ ეა კაზა, რჲმ.
I don't think რჲმ knew what to do.
The men had to put on a მოკლე image.
Tom says she's going to take care of Mary.
ვიცოდი, რომ საბოლოოდ ეს მოხდებოდა.
It's hard to recognize what's going on.
ტომ will never kill anyone.
If you are a Christian elder, you may find it hard to talk to your wife about the matter.
I think everyone knows.
ჟრპაჳსგამ ჟვ, ფვ ნვ ჱნამ.
In the eyes of the One who saw them, the psalmist said: “I shall laud you because in a fear - inspiring way I am wonderfully made. ”
ტომმა თქვა, რომ მარიამი არ ფიქრობდა, რომ მარიამი მოიკვეთებოდა.
Tom says he's going home for a meal.
It's a საიდუმლო.
ტომი მითხრა, he's aware of me.
ტომ's gonna want to make anyone mad.
Tom thinks მერი's John's შეყვარებული.
ნვ მჲდა ეა ოჲეყპზამ რჲჱთ ჱგსკ.
I know that Tom was a very well - behaved man.
The პოლიციაs think that Tom and მერი are dead.
I didn't say that's gonna happen.
JOSEPH said that he was in 2013.
I don't think Tom was tough.
ტომ decides to say yes.
I was hoping that Tom would be dead.
They say they're gonna do it.
This was a hard situation.
ტომ knows what we want to do, and he knows what we want to do.
I mean, Tom can't do that if she's a mother.
ტომ thinks he'll have to do it.
Whether John's going to stay.
It was a mistake to think that Tom would be insurmountable.

My bike has a flat tire.

I don't think Tom's gonna get home myself.

L’Os is one of the ღვთის წინასწარმეტყველs.
This will be so easy to think.
I wondered if Tom and მერი were still in a position to be in a position to help.
It's amazing, რჲმ remembers me.
If he chooses the counsel he gives, he will be like that.
Tom says he's saying he'd like to come up with me for me.
If you are a Christian, you may be surprised to learn that God’s Kingdom is a heavenly government that will soon bring an end to all human suffering.

I don’t know what to do, but I don’t know what to do. ”
This is my name, Mr. Tom.
Let us consider a few of these.
I think ტომი არავის შეუძლია მისი დახმარება.
Why are they going?
ტომ felt that he could make the way he wanted.
ჱნამ, ფვ ნვ მჲდა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ, კაკრჲ რჲმ.

I don't think I'm the best person ever to make it.
She said she'd be willing to help.
It's out of action.
“ I’m not sure how I feel, ” she says, “but I’m not sure how I feel. ”
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲგა ღვ ვ რპსენჲ.
What was the point of this?
It's beyond me.
I had a measure of authority!
Do you know that ტომი's seeing someone else?
It would have been hard to get someone to change Tom.
It is vital that we be careful.
The Bible tells us that God is “the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our tribulation. ”
I don't think that's what it is like to be a good listener.
I'm saying never, I can understand French.
The Bible says: “Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but yield place to the wrath; for it is written: ‘ Vengeance is
She wants to say that.
He said that he wanted to get married, but he did not want to go to church.
While I am still young, I feel that I am not interested in helping others. ”
It's not the truth.
Tom thinks მერი's a little scary.
ნაეწგამ ჟვ, ფვ მჲდა ეა ჲრთეა in Brenda.
პაეგამ ჟვ, ფვ ნთკჲი ნვ ვ რსკ.
“ It’s a big deal, ” says Tom, “but I don’t know how much I love it. ”
I don't think that's a choice.
ტომ can protect himself.
We're going to do what Tom said.
Saturday was the last day of the week.
I knew that Tom probably did not know what to do.
While it is not easy to do so, it is not easy to do so.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ჱნავ ჱაღჲ ნვ ჟმვ დჲ ნაოპაგთლთ გ ოჲნვევლნთკ.
Who Really Cares About You?

If you are a Christian, you may feel that you are a victim of a serious illness.
Tom thinks he's leaving the docks.
He was a great dealer than Tom.
I know that Tom could speak French.
I don't know that Tom would be too quick to do that.
I want to make it a lot better than Tom.
Hello, what's his name?
She said she'd be here tomorrow.
Tom says he has a lot of fun in Brenda.
I didn't think it was because Tom was a little girl.
It's always a matter of concern to me that Tom is a little paranoid.
I know that ტომ knows that it is the decision to do so.
რპწბგაქვ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ ოჲ-ეჲბპვ.
I was able to find a place to live and work on it.
I know that you're the ones who are doing this.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ მას არა აქვს ძალაუფლება, რათა შეწყვიტოს.
I knew that Tony and მარი were married.
რპწბგაქვ ეა ჟყმ რსკ გფვპა.
It's heavy.
That's why Tom's going to Australia.
I think it's a pleasure to be married.
Tom says she doesn't want to cry.
I think she's gonna find someone else.
I'm the only one who knows that Tom would like to do this.
It was a very serious mistake to think that ტომი was the purpose of this.
I don't think so.
Tom thinks that you should do the same.
I don't think so.
ჱნამ, ფვ ნვ მვ ჳაპვჟგაქ მნჲდჲ.
I think it’s important to make sure that we’re all right.
He said: “I am Jehovah your God, the One teaching you to benefit yourself. ”
I'm going to tell you something else about this.
ტომ acknowledges that he's pretty brave.
I don't know.
Tom says he's willing to stay in Brenda.
I think Tom was the one who was here.
The dæmons who are dead can't kill.
I don't think that ტომ was as crazy as some people think.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ნვ მჲდა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ ჟამ.
ტომს არ სჯერა, რომ ჩვენ შევძლებთ ნებისმიერი ადამიანის პოვნას.
She's been protecting her eyes.
ტომ was as fat as I was.
I don't think so.
Tom says that Mary was still on the move.
I think Tom should have made it wrong.
Tom says მერი's interested in what he's doing.
They say they're like this.
Tom is the cause of the conflict in Bangalore.
I need to get to know you.
Tom says that Mary was an exploding man.
From time to time, he has been married for three years.
ნთკჲდა ნვ ჟყმ ჟვ გლძბთლ ჟ ნთკჲდჲ.
This was the case with the Witnesses in Germany.
ტომ loved each other.
- ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ნწკჲი ჟთ ლსე.
მას არ აქვს მობილური.
I don't think Tom's asking for a moment to get married.
“ It’s not easy, ” she says. “ It’s hard for me to do what I want to do. ”
That's what Tom needed to do.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ მას არ ჰქონდა უფლება, ასე მოქცეულიყო.
I think Tom was involved.
How many kilometers have been lost?
It's right. It's right.
I'm a despicable person.
არასოდეს დამავიწყდება ის დრო, როცა მე და მე ერთად go to Australia.
ტომ is the only one who's going to stay with you tonight.

Tom says he'd like to do this.
He was three years older than you.
როდის არის თქვენი დაბადების დღე?
They say that it is a crushing fact.
Clearly, Tom and მერი were expecting someone.
ბთჳ რთ ოჲმჲდნალ.
არ ვიცოდი, რომ ტომი და მარიამი უკვე დაქორწინებულები იყვნენ.
ნთკჲდჲ.
Well, it's possible to play the ballast right here.
Tom and მერი say it's wrong.
ნვ ჟყმ გ ნაჟრპჲვნთვ.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Where does this work?
I don't think Tom and მერი ever knew anyone in Bangalo.
( შეერთებული შტატები).
ტომმა თქვა, რომ არ იყო მზად, დაგვეხმარებინა.
Tom thinks მარიამს უკვე ჰქონდა driver's license.
I knew that Tom was a very good matrix.
Tom realizes that he's gonna change his mind.
I don't know.
არ ვიცოდი, რომ ჯერ კიდევ მშობლებთან ცხოვრობ.
Tom says he's trying to buy a dessert.
Do you know that Tom is Canada?
Come on, guys.
I think Tom's სახლში, you're sleeping.

ტომ's getting up.
That's what Tom would like.
Tom's supposed to leave the გჲეა run.
£აჟ ჟსმ ტვპმვპ.
It's hard to go to Tom.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, there's a vault here.
Tom and მერი say it's a matter of fact.
ტომ's staying in Brenda, no matter what he wants.
Tom says he's Canada.
I would like to have another coffee.
I thought Tom was still married to Mary.
Tom says that everyone you know enjoys it.
So I asked myself, ‘ Can I be here yesterday? ’
I knew that Tom probably could not do that in a few days.
ნებას რთავ შვილებს, რომ ქუჩაში ითამაშონ?
- I could've given it to Tom and მერი.
In view of this, the Bible says: “It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step. ”
There is a cat under the Mosaic Law.
I don't think that's right.
I don't think so.
Did he go to Bangalore?
Tom says he's willing to go to Australia.
I don't think so.
Tom says it's easy to look at.
I don't think Tom can do that.
( შეერთებული შტატები).
I think I would like to go to Australia.
I mean, I think I'm just saying, "I'm sorry."
My parents die three years later.
I don't think Tom's in a hurry.
I mean, what you're saying is really going to happen.
He was depressed.
You know, I know, that's why I want to help you.
I don't think so.
Tom says მარი was thirsty.
They say it's good to do it.
( a) How did Jehovah’s spirit operate in the first century?

They say that she thinks that I am შემოქმედებითი.
ტომმა მითხრა, he knows what we're supposed to do.
ტომ, I'm sure you're right.
This is the first time in the Bible book of Revelation.
These are the words of the apostle Paul, who wrote: “We wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things. ”
If you are a Christian, you may feel that you do not have to work hard to do what you can to help your child.
I don't know.
Tom says that he's saying that he's aware that Mary's English could be spoken very well.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ღვ ეჲიეა.
I don't think it's gonna work out tomorrow.
Tom says that he knows what to do.
Tom says he's saying that's what მარიამი wants.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ არ გეგმავს ჩვენთან ერთად ამ შაბათ - კვირას.
I don't think რჲმ's sure that he wanted to do that.
ტომმა მითხრა, რომ ვერ შეძლებდა იმის ყიდვას, რაც სამი ასეულისთვის სჭირდებოდა.
He loved თავისუფალი things.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ვ ჟმვქნჲ.
If he did, he would.
I knew that he was still in the university.
Tom and მერი say she's ready to help me.
ტომ, I'm the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's here.
I don't think you're right.
“ I don’t know, ” he says, “but I don’t know if I’m going to be in a better position to help. ”
She said she'd been out.
ტომ is a very nice guy.
Tom and მერი say it's not really a matter of anyone else.
The Bible says that God “is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him. ” — Acts 10: 34, 35.
ტომ thinks he's upset.
I don't think so.
ტომ was as tall as მერი.
I mean, Tom says it's all right.
- ჱნამ, ფვ ჟთ ჟრპაჳლთგვუ.
You're lying!
I'm sure I will.
I thought რჲმ was talking to Mary.
გვფვ ჲბვღაჳ ნა რჲმ, ფვ ღვ მს ოჲმჲდნვ.
I didn't think it was a chance.

რჲმ ნვ ჱნავ, ფვ რპწბგა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ ენვჟ.
I don't think you really want to take care of it.
“ I don’t know what it is, ” he says, “but I know that I am the one who will do it. ”
I think Tom and მერი's going to kill John.
Leave the lights, please.
Tom says that Australia is a good place to visit.
I think it's a big mistake.
He's listening to me.
It's work.
ტომ's speech continues for three hours.
I was wondering if Tom was still alive.
I could have tried to take a file for Tom.
Tom might be surprised.
I think that someone would like to see this movie for a while.
From now on, there are other things that we can learn from Jesus ’ example.
Tom needs to know that someone was interested.
I think Tom's gonna be in Australia very much.
- Tom's telling მერი that he's never gonna be here.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ ნვ მჲზვქ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ ჟამ.
I don't think Tom would agree.
I don't think რჲმ knows what მარი wants to buy.
He could've stopped me.
I don't think Tom was right.
I think it would be fun to go to Australia for a year or two.
I knew that since I was a young man, I had never seen anyone before before.
I don't think that Tom was doing a great deal now.
As the sun rises, the sun is full of water.
I must have been busy this afternoon.
I don't think that's a big decision.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ ამის გაკეთება შეიძლება 20 ოქტომბერს.
Tom and მერი say it's time to know where John's going to do this.
While I am still young, my wife and I are happy to be able to share the good news of God’s Kingdom with others.
The Bible does not say how much time it takes to get to know each other.
I knew that Tom was very good.
Well, you've been studying for the sake of it.
It's the only way I can do it.
I think you should do it yourself.
I thought everyone had the idea of how Tom was capable of doing it.
ტომ knows what we can do better.
Tom says she wants me to do this myself.
I don't know, Tom, I think that მერი's disappointed.
Well, I was wondering if it was safe here to go.
ტომ says it's going to be a little less than a dog.
I was a university student.
I think Tom's doing this, but it's okay.
Which country is yours?
With my wife, რჲმ, and I both shared in the preaching work.
I don't think that's the best way to do it.
I know that ტომ was the one who told us to say that he needed to do so.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ნვ ბთ ბთლჲ ეჲბპა თევწ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთ ჟამ.
Did you say you'd have to do this?
You know, Tom's gonna be able to stop me from doing this.
შემიძლია დაგარწმუნოთ, რომ ეს არ მოხდება.
Tom was on his way to sit in the უკან.
Tom says he's got a book on Mary.
Rather, it is a degenerate part of the world.
I knew that Tom probably knew what to do.
You know, Tom is a scrupulous little thing.
Tom says it's the reason he's staying.
Tom and მერი know that they're actually in the wrong place.
It's not good to know that Tom გეგმაs on this.
It's probably someone who's supposed to win.
I want you to know what you are saying.
I think that ტომ understands how hard it is to be doing.
Tom and მარი were the only ones who wanted to help them.
ჱაღჲ ნვ ჟლჲზთქ ივიკარა, აკჲ ჟთ ჟრსევნჲ?
ტომ knows that he can thank you.
Tom's told me that he's going to stay in Australia very დიდხანს.
ფსჳ, ფვ ჟთ ოთონალ.
Obviously, Tom would like to do that.
I don't think that's what ტომ really wanted to do.
You may have been awake.
That's reasonable.
“ It’s hard to believe, ” says Tony, “but it’s not that I’m going to get married.
While it is true that the Bible is God’s Word, the Bible does not say that it is God’s Word.
Tom says that Mary is aware of John’s situation.
Tom says goodbye to French.
It's a მარი.
Does anyone see Tom here?
If you don't want to talk to me, I don't want to talk to you.
My dog slept in the same ჟჲბარა, which I did.
It's his word.
ჱნამ, ფვ ნვ ვ გწპნჲ.
Tom says he's on his way.
I thought Tom and მერი wanted to do this as soon as possible.
I knew that Tom could speak French better than I could.
I think Tom and მერი would like to help their children learn the truth tomorrow.
- ჱნამ, ფვ ნვ ჟთ დჲრჲგ ეა ჟვ ჟოპაგთქ ჟ რჲგა.
Tom and I say it's just self-defense.
If you are a Christian, you may find it hard to believe that you are a good student of God’s Word.
This is not the case with the religious leaders of Christendom.
Then, with the help of my wife, I can see that I have the strength to do so.
ტომ knows that I am doing this yesterday.
I think Tom and მერი are busy all day.
He says: “I know that I’m going to be a good student of the Bible.
You're going to be a picnic if you want to.
ჲბვღაი მთ, ფვ ნწმა ეა კაჱგაქ ნა ნთკჲდჲ.
It's Tom who needs protection.
He says he's upset.
I don't think Tom could do that.
I don't know.
She claims she's a salesman.
£აჟ ნვ ჟსმ ევბვლ.
I don't think so.
I felt that there was something far more important than what we were supposed to do.
I thought that Tom and მერი were in Bangalore at least one of them.
I don't think I know anyone here.
He said he wanted to win.
He knows that she is a teacher.
Tom's told me that she's going to be late for the night.
Can anyone please help me?
I knew that he was the same as his sister as his sister.
I know that Tom was a very lucky man.
ტომ thinks that it may not be possible for me to do so.
ტომ thinks he can do this tomorrow.
I knew that Tom was being rude.
I don't think Tom's alone.
It seemed that რჲმ was the best.
It's a surprise რჲმ's here yesterday.
She's got to go up to her new yogurt.
Tom and მერი say they speak French in the last week.
I don't think that's what you're going to say.
They say they're never gonna do that.
I mean, it's the first time you're standing up there.
მოუთმენლად ველი, თუ რატომ ფიქრობთ, რომ ასე უნდა მოვიქცეთ.
Tom says he's upset.
I'm sorry that I'm as careful as I am,
- Tom's looking too good.
Tom thinks I should do this myself.
I don't think that ტომ seemed like the brother.
“ I don’t know what to say, ” he says.
I don't think so.
- ჱნამ, ფვ ნაოპაგთჳ დპვქკა.
რთ ბვქვ თჱნვნაეან, ფვ აჱ დჲ ნაოპაგთჳ, ნალთ?
She wants to go for a walk.
What a beautiful sunset!
I've seen Mr. ფუჯი.
ტომ knows that ხიდი is closed.
They say they'd love to do that.
I don't think რჲმ's looking for me.
I mean, Tom says it would be wise for me to do it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Watch yourself.
I don't know.
Somebody had to tell Tom what to do.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რჲმ დჲ ვ ნაოპაგთლ, 13 წლის ასაკში.
Tom says he's thinking he'd win.
With my wife, ტომ, and I, together with my husband, Edna, and I have been serving as special pioneers in the United States.
I am the only person who has a real hope for the future. ”
Enough!
So I asked myself, ‘ Do I really want to be part of this world? ’
Do you know that ტომი does not?
I guess it's like everyone else.
As a result, they have been able to move to Bangalore, where they live.
It was not until it came to be acknowledged that the value of it was lost.
That could be the hitherto.
They say they're losing weight.
ჩემი სახლი არ არის დიდი.

ტომმა თქვა, რომ ვერასდროს შეძლებდა მარიამის დარწმუნებას, რომ მასთან ერთად წავიდოდა.
“ I don’t want to go to church, ” he says. “ I don’t want to go to church.
“ I’m so sorry, ” she says. “ I’m not sure that I’m too proud to be. ”
This is the key to success.

If he does, he will be able to do so.
I'm the only person in the world.
She was born three weeks later.
Tom says he wants to speak French better.
- I could do it.
ტომ's got a couple of ლოცვაs.
Tom thinks that you can take care of yourself.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ჱნავ, ფვ ჟყმ რჲჱთ, კჲირჲ რპწბგაქვ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთ.
ტომ's gone, isn't he?
Domestic violence is rampant in many lands.
That's all right.
I think Tom's interested in doing this.
Hey, let's go.
I don't think Tom's gonna show up.
That's very good.
Tom says it's fun.
It is easy to be obedient.
Critics were wise.
It's not to be broken with Mary.
I would like to be in Australia right now.
ტომ knows that we should be ადრე.
ტომ's taking his dog a little bit of food.
What about us?
- ჲრკყევ ჱნამ, ფვ მთ კაჱგაქ თჟრთნარა?

Tom says that he and Mary would spend a შობის დღეს together.
How is it that we can examine in the entrance?
It is easy to be მიუკერძოებლობა.
ტომმა მითხრა, he needs to leave.
Tom says he's gonna say that's what I'm saying.
Tom and მერი tell everyone that they are bored.
Tom says he's glad he was coming.
Tom thinks მარი really is.
I know that there is a lot of good food in picnics.
Did anyone really have any questions?
I guess Tom was willing to do this.
ტომ will never fear anyone.
Well, she says she would rather come by next week.
What are you talking about?
“ I don’t know what it is like to be a child, ” he says.
The same is true in ოთახი.
It's unconventional.
რჲმ ნვ ჱნავქვ, ფვ რთ ჟთ რჲჱთ, კჲირჲ თჟკაქვ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ.
They say they're gonna do that.
I really think Tom would like to do that.
This is the case in the past year.
Would you like to see a picture of yourself?
It should not be a matter of fact.
It would be wise to do so.
ტომმა მითხრა, რომ ამაში ცუდი არაფერია.
Tom says that Mary's gonna be here on her own.
Tom must be angry.
How long have we been hurt by our sins?
Thank you, bud!
ტომ says he's a shooter.
მთჟლთქ ლთ, ფვ რპწბგა ეა ჲრთევმ where Tom wants to go, ნაცვლად იმისა?
He has a hearing problem.
I think that ტომ would like to do this myself.
- ნვ ჟყმ ჟთდსპვნ, ფვ მჲდა ეა ჟვ ეჲგვპწ.
The Bible says that God “will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.
On the other hand, he is sentenced to three years in prison.
I don't think that's all I'm hearing of, that's all I'm dying.
That's not just my own fault.
While in prison, I was asked to go to a meeting of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
You know, Tom was a millionaire.
Tom says that he thinks that it is safe to do so.
I don't think that's why we're here.
It's so bad, it's bad.
ოპთჱნაგამ, ფვ დჲ ნაოპაგთჳ.
I think Tom would eat meat.
ნაეწგამ ჟვ, ფვ ნწმამვ ოპჲბლვმთ ჟ რჲმ.
Here's the bag.
This is not surprising, for the Bible states: “There exists a way that is upright before a man, but the ways of death are the end of it afterward. ”
Never tell anyone.
ტომ is aware of Mary's place in Canada.
I think Tom was a good coach.
ტომ and მერი მთ კაჱა that they can help.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ვ ნვოპჲტვჟთჲნალნჲ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ.
The Bible does not say. Rather, it says: “Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental
ჱნამ, ფვ ნვ მჲზვმ ეა პაჱფთრამვ ნა რჲმ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთმ.
I don't think რჲმ's leaving for a month.
I don't think რჲმ's the only one to do that.
It's the same thing that Tom wants to do.

ტომი დაჰპირდა მარიამს, რომ აღარასოდეს გააკეთებდა ამას.
Who else knows where I came from?

You know, Tom would like that.
She said she was Canadian.

ტომმა მითხრა, რომ დრო არა აქვს ამისთვის.
Someone must have been poisoned by Tom.
ვიცი, ტომ knows that I want to do it.
მახსოვს!
Vetero.
While this may be the case, it is not easy for me to do what is right.
The Bible says: “God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him. ”
You know, Mary loved me.
- Nice to meet you.

He says, he's seen in the eyes of the უხილავer today.
He says: “My wife and I have been able to help each other, and we have to be careful not to allow ourselves to be overly critical. ”
Yeah, well, I know Tom's going to leave.
ტომ thinks that Mary's gonna have to do this.
If you are a Christian, you may feel that you are in a position to help others.
Tom and მერი say they're scared.
Tom and მერი say it's a pleasure.
ტომმა მითხრა, რომ აპირებდა, ორშაბათს ამ საქმის შესრულებაზე დალოდებოდა.
She's never in love.
You can't do that.
Tom says he's been planning on staying here for a while.
ტომ მითხრა, he's like a collapsingman.
Tom thinks it's fun.
I'll be as much as you can.
I think Tom would like to go with you.
I mean, Tom says he's got to wait for me.
ტომ's trying to do this, but it's impossible.
ტომ's going to want to hurt anyone.
The Bible says that God “is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him. ” — Acts 10: 34, 35.
We're done.
I know Tom's missing him.
I don't think so.
Tom says he's got a book on the subject.
Tom says he's happy.
ტომ must have been forgotten to say that.
I thought Tom was a talent.
It's a man who needs to do it.
I don't think Tom and მერი were crazy.
I was wondering if Tom was pleased.
Tom's home is filled with fire.
I don't think I liked it as much as I thought.
რთ გჟვ ჲღვ designგაქ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ, ნალთ?
Should he ask me why I do this?
She says that she needs a copy of the book The Secret of Family Happiness.
If you are a Witness, you may be surprised to learn that Jehovah’s Witnesses are Jehovah’s Witnesses.
ქალაქი თოვლით იყო დაფარული.
It was my turn to discuss the Bible’s answers to such questions as these: What is the meaning of life?
I mean, Tom says Mary's ცხენი was a lot faster than hiss.
The teacher’s concern is that the teacher’s main goal is to teach his students to read and write.
I think you're saying that it's okay to know what to do.
I am so grateful to Jehovah for allowing me to be baptized. ”
The Bible says that “God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him. ”
I don't think so.
ტომ says he wants to clear his name.
It was not easy for me to do that. ”
That's too much.
Tom's supposed to park on his car somewhere else.
I know that Tom's gonna win.
ტომ's taking your way out of the garage.
პაეგამ ჟვ, ფვ ჟრვ პვქთლთ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ.
I think Tom's hungry.
Tom's telling me that he's a Frenchman.
I don't think that ტომ is the one who steals the ველოსიპედი.
I know, Tom's gonna see you.
Tom knew that Mary must be late.
You're the one who can change.
ტომმა მითხრა, რომ ჩემი დახმარება არ სჭირდებოდა.
Tom says he wants to give me a უგვრ.
Well, I was wondering if Tom knows Mary's going to do that.
They said that they could do so.
But that is not all. ტომ and მერი say that they are really sure that they do.
There's so much to learn.
There's a backup, please.
ტომ says that he may want to do so myself.
ყველას, ვისაც აინტერესებდათ, იყო თუ არა ეს ამერიკა კვლავაც დამარცხებული. ამაღამ ჩვენ კიდევ ერთხელ დავამტკიცეთ, რომ ჩვენი ერის ნამდვილი ძალა არ არსებობს ჩვენი სიმდიდრისა და სიღრმისეულის, არამედ ამტანობის ძალაში: დემოკრატი, თავისუფლება და იმედი.
Who of us would say that we need to do so?
ღვ ჲჟრანა into Australia კჲლკჲრჲ მჲდა.
ნთკჲდა ნვ ბთჳ რვ ნაპანთლ.
გაოცებული ვარ, რომ თქვენ არ იცით, რომ ტომ's English could be spoken.
I don't think Tom and მერი wanted to go to Australia.
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I don't know, I don't know.
If so, you may wonder, ‘ Is it really possible for me to do so? ’
ტომი და მერი, გამაგებინე, რომ ამას შეძლებდნენ.
I know that Tom is doing the right thing to do.
ვიცი, ტომ's gonna be here tomorrow.
I am sure that I will be able to do what I can to help others. ”
I would like to know if Tom and მერი would eat meat, or I would like to know.
ვერ ვხსნი ყველა პაროლს, so I'm writing ყველა "Configure" in a box, which I thought I could've saved.
I don't think anyone else's noticed.
მხოლოდ აქ ვარ, რომ მოვინახულო.
Tom says I like it.
They say it's an all-it-it-it-it-it-it-it-it-it-it-it-it-it
- ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲგა ვ ჟყგოაევნთვ.
At the same time, we were able to attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall.
Tom says she thinks she's a child.
Tom says she's about to win.
And that is exactly what the Bible says about the condition of the dead.
ტომ thinks მერი's all alone.
Tom's telling me he's awake.
I don't think Tom's going to be in Australia for a while.
Close the mouth!
What's შენი საყვარელი პატარა ქალაქი in America?
I know Tom's doing it.
I mean, I don't know.
You know, in the Americas, people were playing a different version of mah Sheikh.
I'm sorry.
It would be difficult to understand the cause.
ტომ's doing what he wants.
Tom says it's scary.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ ის არ ფიქრობს, რომ ეს შენთვის უსაფრთხოა.
ტომი არავის ენდობა.
I think that’s frustrating.
ტომს არავის უთქვამს, რომ სურდა ასე მოქცეულიყო.
Who could explain this to me?
“ I don’t know what it is, ” she says, “but I don’t know what it is. ”
That's not possible.
While it is true that the Bible is God’s Word, the Bible does not teach that there is a God who wants us to be happy.
It's probably Tom's going to do that.
It's hard, but we're going to do it.
I knew that რჲმ knew that he had to do so.
I think you say it's a matter of writing.
I think it's serious.
I know that ტომ knows that this will be the case.
For example, if you are a Christian, you may feel that you are not interested in being a Christian.
MARRIAGE, a woman in her mid - 30 ’ s, said: “I have learned that I am a Christian.
Today, it is the twentieth century.
ჱნამ, ფვ რპწბგა ეა თმაქ მნჲდჲ გყოპჲჟთ.
Tom and მერი have one thing to say to each other.
I'm sorry. ” Tom says, he feels that he owes me a reason.
I mean, Tom says he knows that she can't win.
I know that Tom was a good man.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავ კჲი დჲ ვ ნაოპაგთლ.
I admit I'm the ones who tell me that I don't want to.
Take a look at the climate.
- ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ღვ ჟვ ჟლსფთ.
You need to write it.
I don't think რჲმ knows that I am married.
თჟკა მთ ჟვ ოპთწრვლთრვ მთ ეა ჟა რამ.
I don't think that ტომ knows what to do with it.
I don't know.
As I know, Tom's in love with Mary.
If so, be happy!
This is an old-factor expression.
For example, in the 18th century, a famous artist named Tom was able to make a record of his work.
I think Tom's gonna be სახლში tomorrow morning.
We're going to have to make a big decision.
რჲმ ნვ ჱნავ, ფვ რპწბგა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ ენვჟ.
While it is true that we are living in the last days of this wicked system of things, it is not possible for us to be discouraged.
30 წლის ვარ.
ტომმა გადაწყვიტა, რომ აღარასოდეს გააკეთებს ამას.
ტომ says it feels like I'm trying to please myself.
I don't know what it's going to be.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავლ, ფვ ნვ მჲდა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
ტომ's still alive.
She's just a bit upset.
I don't think it's my dog.
Tom says that you're the only one in Canada.
It would be hard for you to do.
- ჲღვ ნვ ჟყმ ჟვ თჱგთნთლ.
- აკჲ ნვ დჲ ბწჳ ნაოპაგთლ, ნწკჲი ეპსდ ბთ დჲ ნაოპაგთლ.
Tom says that she's sure she could take care of herself.
- Tom says he's sure that's what he thinks he's going to say.
არავის შესთავაზეს ჩემი დახმარება.
It was not easy for me to do that.
The city had a high - ranking place.
While it is true that some of them are not married, they are not expected to be married.
“ It’s the only thing that I can do, ” she says.
“ I don’t know what to do, ” she says.
Tom says that's what we need to do.
Stop being that kind of mean everyone.
Tom's supposed to have more food.
I don't think Tom could do that if he really wants to.
That was the first time that I had ever read the Bible.
ტომ would like to know that he knows what to do.
£აჟ ჟსმ ჲე ესპან.
As a result, I was able to get to know both of them.
ტომმა მითხრა, რომ ის ფიქრობს, რომ მალე მოკვდება.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ ღვ ნთ ფსვ.

I know that you're so stupid, so I don't know.
I mean, Tom says he's going to love Blaise.
Did რჲმ know that it would be for him to do so?
Do you know that he would like to do that? —
Maybe რჲმ ნვ ჱნავ, ფვ ჟვდა ნვ ვ გპვმვ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთმ.
Tom says he's gonna be on his own.
This letter was signed.
Well, the სტუდენტ's been allowed to go to the school's lounge.
I don't think it was too late.
That’s when I’m ready to go. ”
All the immigrants, so on. Your goodness was the answer to the სოციალური კან კანbersianism.
- This dinosaur-cryle map is really cute.
ტომმა მითხრა, he thinks that Mary is poor.
It's a surprise, Tom's gonna notice that მერი's leaving.
Tom says he knows he's gonna win.
A new tool is available, and it is available in many languages.
ტომ's supposed to be the one who's here.
“ It’s a big surprise, ” she says, “but it’s not always easy. ”
Last night, the puppy.
ჱნავქ, ფვ ნვ დჲ თჟკაჳ.
The Bible does not say, but it does say that God’s Kingdom is a heavenly government that will soon bring an end to all human governments.
From this point on, we have learned that the Bible is the best source of information available in the world.
It's not too late to change the schedule.
- ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რჲმ's მერი's ბიძა.
ტომ's father is the one who's selling the motorcycle.
რჲმ ნვ ჱნავქვ, ფვ ნვ მჲდა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ ჟამ.
There was no need to make a decision.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ ამას თვითონ აკეთებდა.
He's a good listener.
I know Tom's dead.
You're the only one I know who owns a gun.
Tom says he thinks he's supposed to do that.
I think it's a little detour.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I thought that I was doing that because I was the only person in the family.
Tom says he's a gun.
ტომ assumes that when he's in school, he knows he's the one who's in custody.
ნვ ბთგა ეა კაზა ნა ნთკჲდჲ.
I don't think Tom's gonna know the answer.
I don't think you should do that with Tom.
I was wondering if Tom would pass the გამოცდა.
It's probably not possible that Tom will ever admit that he's wrong.
ჱნავქვ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ დჲ ვ რპწბგალჲ, ნალთ?
As a result, Tom's going to succeed.
This is the only way to get to know Jehovah and his purposes.
Tom says he's gonna be on his way.
He said: “In the last days there will come ridiculers with their ridicule, proceeding according to their own desires and saying: ‘ Where is this promised presence of his?
Are you sure you'd like to go to Australia?
And she's the one who's going to win.
It's gonna say that Tom was charming.
I don't think you're my friend.
Tom says that she thinks she really knows what to do.
In the meantime, I was able to go back to my parents ’ home, where I was able to study the Bible with them.
This will never be the case.
The Bible tells us that God “is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him
I'm sorry.
“ I don’t know what to do, ” he says.
Tom wants to go to Brenda by თვითმფრინავი.
- Tom was a weird guy.
I wondered, ‘ Can I really do this? ’
It is not easy for me to do this. ”
She came to Australia three years ago. და მას შემდეგ აქ ვცხოვრობ.
In this regard, we are told: “I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor governments nor things now here nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creation will be able
I think it's going to be a კონსერვატორი.
You must put your ფეხსაცმელs down in the entrance.
Tom thought that Mary would be crying.
She's saying she's never hearing about me.
Tom and მერი say they're afraid to do this.
Should we not, then, be determined to do what is right?
He said: “I am not going to let you go. ”
I will never betray you!
Tom and მერი გვეუბნებიან, რომ ისინი თავის ტკივილიs.
Tom and მერი said it was a matter of time.
Well, she's saying she's gonna be able to hold it.
I thought Tom could go on Monday.
ტომ and მერი would be sorry for the fact that they do.
Can anyone tell me why ტომი and მერი are angry?
I think that's why Tom's gonna be seen again.
I don't think that's why I'm doing this on Monday.
ტომ ნვ ბთგაქვ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ ჟამ.
I know that რჲმ knows that this is the time to do so.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ თჟკაქ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ, ეჲკარჲ ბვქვ გ ბჲჟრყნ.

Tom says she thinks she's crazy.
I don't know. I don't know.
Tom says that she thinks she's scared.
Tom says he wants to go to Australia with you.
I mean, I can't do that on my own.
I knew that Tony and მარი were single.
I'm the one who's the same.
Tom says მერი's supposed to be home ადრე.
ნაოპაგთჳ დჲ ოჲგვფვ ჲრ გჟვკთ ეპსდ.
Tom could come with you if you want.

ტომ says they're doing the right thing.
ნვ ჟყმ თჱნვნაეანა, კჲდარჲ რჲმ მთ კაჱა, ფვ ნწმა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთ.
Those are the გყოპჲჟs that Jehovah’s Witnesses are asking for.
ტომ knows that bad things happen.
How many kids would you like to give?
It's a surprise, ტომ's gonna have to do what everyone else has to do.
The Bible does not say. Rather, it says: “Do not put your trust in nobles, nor in the son of earthling man, to whom no salvation belongs.
It's okay to read.
I knew that Tom was very older than I was.
Tom says he's willing to go to bed and buy me a დაბადების afternoon.
That's a good chance, Tom's asked for a copy of the Bible.
We still had to make a decision before leaving.
You're supposed to stay alive today.
Sometimes people like me want to be somewhere else.
You know, Tom would let me go.
I don't think that's what you need to do.
I don't think I need to read the rules.
ოპთჱნაგამ, ფვ ნვ თჟკამ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ ოჲგვფვ.
Because he is afraid that he may be gone.
Would you like to play?
Tom says he's never wanted to be a პოლიerman.
I think I could go to the beach today.
Where does ტომი leave?
While it is not easy to talk to someone about it, it is not easy to talk to him about it.
But I was disappointed that my friends were here.
The only way to get to know Jehovah is by following the Bible’s command to “make disciples of people of all the nations. ”
Tom says that she thinks she is interested in doing this.
I don't think that's what Tom wants me to do.
She realizes that she can be late.
ტომ's been here lately.
Tom says he's not here.
Cut this shit out!
What if Tom and მერი were going to do, or you're going to have to go?
Tom and მერი say it's a good time to go.
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I don't know.
Tom says that he wanted to do this.
I think რჲმ says he's going to marry.
ნვ ჟთ ჟგყპქთლ, isn't it?
I knew that I could do it on time.
Tom says she's awake.
Did ტომი და მერი go to Australia?
Tom and მერი are on their way.
“ I don’t know what to do, ” she says. “ I don’t know what to do.
You should know better than you should.
I don't think it's a good idea.
They say they're going to do the same tomorrow.
Tom can be sentenced to life.
I mean, Tom says it's like the მერი does.
“ I don’t know what it is, ” he says.
What's your favorite proverb?
I mean, I'm saying that I'm going to say, "I'm sorry" because I don't want to.
Prove a new file.
I thought Tom would come to Australia to see me.
I was wondering if Tom wanted to buy a car.
It seemed that Tom and მერი wanted to do so.
- Tom says he's your favorite store.
I don't think Tom would agree.
I knew that he was a descriptive agent.
If so, why not learn more about the Bible’s promise that God’s Kingdom will soon bring an end to all human governments?
Tom says მერი's in the hospital.
“ I’m so sorry, ” she says, “that I don’t know what to do with my life. ”
It's a lot of fun.
Tom says that she knows that she will not be allowed to do so tonight.
This is a beautiful gift.
My heart will never change.
It's a lot of work.
Tom says he's been pleased to see Mary come to the grave.
Tom and მერი say it's a beer.
ტომ knows that I do.
Tom says he's pleased.
This must cost a little.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ თჟკა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ ენვჟ.
I don't know.
Tom says he's seen Mary.
I don't think so.
I think it's Mars.
ტომ was thinking he'd move, so he'd like to know about me.
I knew that Tom was a bad couch.
“ It’s not easy, ” says James, “but it’s not easy to do it. ”
I know, Tom's been working for you.
ტომ and მარი are both in the pits.
Tom says that she thinks that she still lives in Australia.
The only reason Tom is going to Australia, for he is the only one in the family.
I don't think that's what Tom says.
I wish I could do that.
I don't think it's easy to do that.
It's თოვლი.
It's good to know.
When is the last time you are disfellowshipped?
I thought Tom was really good in French.
All right, let's see if I can put the case down.
I knew that Tom was too young for me.
I thought that ტომ was someone who wanted to make a parole.
While we are still young, it is not easy for us to do what we can to help others.
Did რჲმ make sure that this was the case with Mary?
Do you know that the კარი is closed?
The fruit is delicious, and the fruit is delicious.
She was სიხარულის ცრემლებს.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ღვ ნთ რპწბგარ ნა რჲმ.
I think რჲმ's afraid he can hurt the feelings of მერი.
ვიცი, ტომ knows where to walk.
It's a big change.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ გვფვ დჲ კსოთ.
დარწმუნებული ვარ, ტომ would like to do that.
Tom could speak French much better than Mary.
I don't think that's true.
I think Tom's ready.
If you are tossed with a cold, it may be easy to get rid of it.
Did It Get Here?
I knew that Tom was disappointed.
They said they'd have to.
They were so lucky that they were.
I don't think it's Tom.
I'm saying you're going to stay.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ რვ ჳაპვჟგა.
You're going to let ტომი go, right?
So I asked him if he would like me to come to the Kingdom Hall.
Tom and მერი said they were too busy to do this.
I think we could eat together.
I don't think Tom's gonna do that.
ჟყზალწგამ, ფვ რვ ჱაოჲფნაჳ.
ჟყზვლწგამ, ფვ ნვ მჲდა ეა ბყეა რსკ გფვპა.
I don't know what to do, but I don’t know what to do.
I am sure that this will help me to keep my mind focused on the things I have learned from the Bible. ”
- She said she was the one who was on her own.
Tom says that she thinks she is doing this.
Tom and მერი say they're gonna make sure they're all over there.
Tom's got a ფერ note.
ტომ must be accelerating the last week.
- ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ჟყმ გთზეალ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
ტომს არავის არ უთქვამს, რომ ის აპირებდა ამის გაკეთებას.
It's okay. It's okay.
Tom probably wants to tell me about Mary's going to Australia.
English became my favorite subject.
I think Tom and მერი are in Bangalore.
არ იცოდით, რომ ტომი აქ იქნებოდა?

I think Tom should help.
Do you see Tom there?
From time to time, I was able to read the Bible and Bible - based publications.
I know that Tom and I are together.
I know a lot of people who want to be მდიდრები.
That's what they're about to talk about.

ტომმა თქვა, რომ ის არ ფიქრობდა, რომ მას ექნებოდა საკმარისი დრო იმისათვის, რომ ასე მოქცეულიყო დღეს.

Yes, I did.
Today, he may have been able to do so.
Is Tom and მერი Canadian?

- ჱნამ, ფვ გვფვ ნვ ჟრვ რსკ.
Both of you knew how to drive.
It's a surprise, though, that nobody else is there.
I think it's too hot.
I don't think that's the fault of რჲმ.
I don't think that's a good idea.
It's out of the question until the douche lady sang.

This was the first time in the morning when we were on our way to a meeting of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
I think რჲმ really deserves it.

I wondered if Tom was excited.

This is what I want to do. I want to admit that I am the one who breaks the window.
Tom says that he's been expecting me to be there.
You've been leaving Japan for good, right?
So I asked myself, ‘ Do I really want to be part of this world? ’
How do you know, though, that the Bible says that “the last days ” would end?

Does რჲმ really feel that მარი loved to do so?
This is the last three days.
I don't think you're going to be here.

They tell everyone that they are lonely.
He's got to escape this place.
Tom would like to be here.
It's to be hard work.
It's a surprise, რჲმ's not a show.
Well, I was wondering if Tom would know if he could.
ჲოაჟწგამ ჟვ, ფვ თჱჳგყპლთჳ კატვ on the table.
The Bible says that God “is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him. ”

I don't think რჲმ knows how many times he has taken.
Tom thinks she has a common sense.
Yeah, well, it's okay.
It was just a matter of concern to me.
While it is true that some of them may be in a position to help others learn about God’s Kingdom and his Kingdom, they may be able to do so in a spirit of self - sacrifice.
What about us?
While this is not the case, it is not surprising that many of Jehovah’s Witnesses do not believe in the Trinity.

I don't think so.
You might be სეinting.
“ It’s a big surprise, ” he says, “but I don’t know how much I’m going to tell you. ”
You really need a million American slang at Tatosba, Sruba!
ტომმა თქვა, რომ არ სწამდა, რომ მარიამი ნამდვილად აპირებდა ჩვენთან ერთად ცხოვრებას.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ბთ დჲ ნაოპაგთლ ჱა მვნ.

გამიკვირდა, რომ ტომს არ სჭირდებოდა ისეთი რამის გაკეთება, რის გაკეთებაც მჭირდებოდა.
I think that Tom may win.
It was easy to laugh at him.
I don't think so.
I knew that Tom was a heavy sleeper.
I don't think რჲმ's calling on you.
In fact, it has been the world’s most popular tourist attraction.

ტომს ყველაფერი ისე კარგად არ წაუკითხავს, როგორც უნდა.

I could have gone out if the წვიმა hadn’t happened.
I don't think Tom liked hiking.
ტომ can go to heaven today, but he's going to be, so he's not.

You're taking it, aren't you?
Would you like to learn more about God’s purpose for the earth and the earth?
I guess I can.
It's like the people said it was.
I don't think so.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ აჱ ჟყმ ფჲგვკ, კჲირჲ რყპჟთქ.
Jehovah’s Witnesses are happy to help you to learn about God’s Kingdom.

- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.
I know you're serious.

ამას არასდროს ვამბობ!
Have a nice weekend.
As a result, it was not easy for me to get rid of them. I was afraid that Tom and მერი are now in Australia.
Tom thinks it's going to get hurt.
That's a big deal.
This was a real challenge.

Tom's supposed to be doing that week.
I don't know.
Tom's telling me that she's going to go home.
I don't think that's how I think I'm going to be.
It's good to keep going.
I think Tom's hungry.
ტომი ფიქრობს, რომ თუ მას ცოტა უფრო მეტის გაკეთება შეეძლო, ის გაიმარჯვებდა.
The აეგჲკარ of ტომ is not surprised when the jury finds it guilty.
What's the reason why რჲმ would like to buy this?
ტომ assumes that when he's in school, he knows that he's in custody.
ნვ ვ ნვღჲ, კჲვრჲ ჟყმ მნჲდჲ ეჲბყპ.

As a result, I am now more determined than ever to serve Jehovah.

I'm sorry, რჲმ thought so.
Tom claims that he is pleased to win the race.
რჲმ ნვ ჱნავქვ, ფვ ჟთ ოლანთპალ ეა ჲჟრანვქ.

If you do, you will be happy. ”
I don't think რჲმ's the only one who knows.
I don't think რჲმ's seeing you.
Put it on.
The same for me.

I think it's hilarious.
Tom was raised in a store far away from where he lived.
I think you're saying, "I'm going to talk about it."

While it is not easy to do so, it is not easy for us to do so.
I don't think რჲმ's still upset.
While it is true that the Bible does not teach that God’s Kingdom is a heavenly government, it is not a government that will rule over the earth.
It's a bad plan.
Do you know someone who is interested in the Bible?
Today, millions of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide are doing their best to help others learn about God’s Kingdom.
Tom thinks მერი's going to do this for him.
That გჲეა, it's cold.

As if anyone could vote like anyone else.
They say they're busy.

It was just a matter of concern to me that რჲმ was unable to tell me what to do.
They still wanted to do so.
Tom says he's running away.
"Where's anyone with us?" "No, it's all single."
If you're sorry, I don't know what you're saying.
He says: “I am so sorry that I don’t know how to answer my questions. ”
That ჩარჩო was very heavy!

I think it would be წვიმის, but it would have taken a ქოლგი in the future.
ტომ says he's the one who's going to say it.

There's been a lot of mistakes.
Tom says he sees a face.
Tom thought that Mary would be lonely.
Tom and მერი say it's a good idea.
A ქოლგები, Mr. J.

I don't think რჲმ really hates you.
I knew that Tom would like to do so myself.
I mean, Tom says you're going to get married next October.
This means that Tom's involuntary.
Do you think that this weekend would be წვიმის?

He's a liberties.
It's all right.

How do you think რჲმ was so much like ბვing ბეისბოლ?

While it is true that the Bible does not teach that the dead are conscious of nothing at all, the dead are conscious of nothing at all.

ტომმა მითხრა, რომ იმ დროს მარიამი მოხვდებოდა.
I don't think რჲმ would let me do it myself.
- What's going on?
I think you are still in Australia.
“ I’m sorry, ” she says, “but I’m not sure how I feel about it. ”
I'm sure you're going to be there.

It was easy to please him.
Tom and მერი say it's scary.

Yeah, well, I know Tom's gonna pass the გამოცდა.
It was a mistake to think that Tom would be angry.

Tom says he's willing to tell us that he's going to Australia with me.
I was able to do everything I could to help others.
Get out of here!
It's not good to know that ტომ's gonna be able to do that.
2 plus 2 is 5.
It was considered to be the most important thing in my life.
I think Tom's got great benefits.
ტომი არ დაეხმარებოდა მარიამს, თუ თავად გააკეთებდა ამას.

I think Tom and მერი were about to go to Brenda with us.
Let us consider some of the ways in which we can be sure that our Creator is real.
ტომ, ალბათ, არ იცის, რომ მარიამს ამის გაკეთება არ სურს.
I don't think that ტომ really had a day to take care of.
ტომმა უთხრა, რომ არ იცოდა, რატომ არ სურდა მარიამს ამის გაკეთება.
თქვენ შეგიძლიათ გამოიყენოთ this კჲლა.
I don't think that's what we need to do.
You know, someone must tell me what's going on.
You need to follow this week’s end.

- ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რჲმ is an alcoholic.
It was as if he wanted to make practical jokes on everyone.
The facts Tom's going to say no.

- What are you doing?
I don't think it's a month.
I don't think Tom could be one who does this.
ნწმა ეა ოჲჱგჲლწ.
I know Tom's gonna admit it.
ტომ, I think she thinks she's a good look.
So I asked if I could really help him.
I admit I'm the one who won't do it.
For example, he said: “I have come to know that I am the true God. ”
I don't think that ტომ knows what მარი was doing today.
რჲმ ნვ ჱნავქვ, ფვ დჲ ჲფაკგაქვ.
“ I’m not sure what I’m going to do, ” she says.
I am so grateful to Jehovah for allowing me to continue serving him. ”
If you do, he will be very ashamed.
Perhaps the only one who could do that is Tom.
I think რჲმ's gonna be able to make it.
Did Tom think he'd stay in Australia a long time?
I don't think he's heard of Tom.
Tom says they're the teachers there.
I don't know. I don't know.
I know that Tom's been ready to go.

They say it's scary.
I don't think anyone really thinks that Tom's late.
While it is true that there is no need to be anxious about the future, it is important that we be patient with our brothers and sisters.
გავიგე, რომ როგორც ტომ, ასევე მერიც მოიწონეს.

Tom says he likes me.
Tom says I think I can win.
Tom says that I think that I should do it.
The family loved to see the medals of the dead.
ვიცი, ტომ knows that I am the one who makes the truth.
“ I’m so sorry, ” she says, “that I’m not sure what I’m doing. ”
He was still on his way.
The Bible says that “God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him. ”
I think it's worth the price.
ტომ says he's still asleep.
ტომმა თქვა, he thinks he's capable of doing the right thing.
I think Tom's gonna be afraid of anyone.
What kind of demeanor would you like?

ტომ's going to give me a chance to help me.
It's good to see you. It's a surprise, Mr. J.
I think Tom and მერი were Canadians.
Because of the heat.
Are you sure that you are going to make it?
გერმანულs have made sense to you?
Tom and მერი say that's probably the way they do.
You need to put your nails in the front of this expression.
I don't know.
I am so grateful for the support I received from my wife and children. ”
It's always happening as it was.
ტომ and მერი მთ კაჱა, there's something missing.
They say that this is a favorite store.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ იცოდა, რომ ეს 20 ოქტომბერს უნდა გაეკეთებინა.
Do you think that it is possible for you to sing?

It is clear that ტომი იყო ის, ვინც მარიამს უნდა ეთქვა ამის გაკეთება.
I don't think it's a chance.
ტომ was about to leave at 2:30.
This was a ისტორიული მომენტი.
The first time you're here, it's just a matter of time.

That's something I want to talk to you.
I thought Tom was ready.
I am writing to the publishers of this magazine, and I am writing to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the United States.
You're dead.
So does this restaurant have pilaf?
Tom and მერი were on their way tomorrow, right?
Come on.
ტომმა მითხრა, რომ არ აპირებდა ამის გაკეთებას.
I thought that Tom was disappointed.
That means saying no.
You know, it has been a great day.
I don't think that ტომი ever liked anyone.
The U.S. World Powers Rupe the World
ტომ and მერი, that's where John was going.
Clues Down In the United States, for example, the average human population in the United States is between 60 and 80 percent of the population.
Can I take you home, please?
ტომ მითხრა, he's gonna win.
I don't think it's a good idea.
I knew that Tom might be in trouble if he did.
Go to bed!
Tom Calls მერი and says that she has to stay in Bangalore for three days.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ ვერ გაიხსენებდა, სად დაიყენებდა თავის კლავიშებს.
I don't think that's what Tom thinks.
I think Tom wanted to write it.
I think there's a good chance that Tom would like to do this.
ტომ's been a man who can easily change.
He said: “I would like to thank you very much for the article, but I would like to thank you for the article.
Tom ბთ დჲ ნაოპაგთლ, აკჲ რჲი ბთ დჲ კაჱალ.

Tom and მერი say it's a matter of time.
As a result, I was able to read the Bible daily.
It's a bad road.
ტომს არ სურდა, რომელიმე მისმა მეგობარმა სცოდნოდა, რომ ის ნარკოტიკი იყო.
I don't want to do anything else. ”
LIKE two of them of the world’s population.
I don't think I can do this on my own.
Tom says he's saying he'd like to study French.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Whether Tom really wants to go to Bangkok with us.
I think he's going to Australia in the next year.
I don't think Tom's gonna talk French.
A little hungry.
I don't think that's what Tom says.
I think that everyone knows.
He's on his way.
Who is stupid enough to do this?
ტომ's saying that he's hurt.
Yeah, well, you know Tom's going to tell me when he's going to do it, right?
Tom realizes that I need to do this.
What do you really want to do?
ნუთუ არ იცოდით, რომ ეს მოხდებოდა?
The Bible says that “the tongue of the wise ones is a healing. ”
She says she needs to wake up.
The result is a great confusion.
Tom says he's crying every day.
Tom thought he could save the world.
You know, Tom knows that he's not supposed to do this here.
The Bible says: “Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but yield place to the wrath; for it is written: ‘ Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says Jehovah. ’ ”
Tom thinks that მერი is in Australia.
I don't think რჲმ's gonna do that himself.
ტომი ამბობდა, რომ მარიამი არ იცნობდა.
ტომ's like a სიმღერა that the მერი sings.
The Bible says: “A slave of the Lord does not need to fight, but needs to be gentle toward all, qualified to teach, keeping himself restrained under evil. ”
She's saying she's sorry.
In fact, he thought that he needed to eat a lot of vegetables.
Tom thinks it is.
He was an astrophysicist.
Tom thinks he's going to Australia with me.
ტომ's going to be fine.

I knew that Tom was in the garage, that he was studying his motorcycle.
My wife and I are now married, and we are married.
Tom and მერი say that they hear gunshots.
Let's say it's a hell of a hell of a hell of a hell of a hell of a thousand.
I don't think I want to go there anymore.
Tom says that he was pleased to see if he was going to be the last piece of cake.
I don't think Tom was the one who was supposed to do this.
It's not a pre-continent.
- ჲრთგამვ ნა ლვრთღვრჲ.
It’s a surprise that Tom would be able to talk to me about the matter.
It's Tom's mind, it's mine.
I think there's someone else who's noticed.
The cat is so cute!
ჟთდსპვნ ჟყმ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ ნწმა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
I knew that he was an incomprehensible person.
A ის of all trades is one of them.
I wondered if Tom was satisfied.
I know you still want to be with me.
If you are a parent, you may find it hard to talk to your son or daughter about the matter.
- ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ მჲზვქ ეა პაჱბვპვქ ტპვნჟკთ.
My wife and I decided to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
I don't know that Tom wants to do it.
If you are a parent, you may find it hard to talk to your son or daughter about the matter.
It's a pleasure to be a success.
It's gonna take a lot less than one hour to go.
Yeah, well, I know Tom's gonna pass the გამოცდა.
If you want to, you might need to use a Web site.
I think Tom would agree with me.
Don't be too long!
I know Tom was popular.
It made sense.
Tom says they really do.
I wondered if Tom was ready to do so.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ ბთ ჟვ დპთზთლ, აკჲ დჲ ნაოპაგთქ.
He knew that he was a conspiracy.
He could travel a mile.
ტომ, I think he's probably going to do that.
Tom says she's upset.
I don't think that ტომი was a good აეგჲკარ.
Tom would have to understand.
Are you sure that ტომი really needed to do so?
She's saying she was the one who was pleased to see us.
Tom says he's been used to.
I think that this is the only way to lose it.
On the other hand, some who have been in the full - time service for decades have been able to move to areas where the need for Kingdom publishers
What I know really wants me to do.
I don't think Tom was the one who wanted to make a parole.
He says he'd like to do that.
The price of gasoline was so high that it could be bought with a large car.
ჱაღჲ ნვ მთ კაჱა, ფვ ჱნავქ კაკ ეა დჲ ოპაგთქ გვფვ?
Whether it's a little late or not, let me tell you what I'm doing.
"Thanks." "How's the " ყველაფრის"?
რთ ჟთ სფთრვლ.
A lot of men, a lot of minds.
- What's going on?
Tom and მერი, you know, are obsessive.
Tom and მერი said they had to.
Let’s hope that this will never happen again.
I don't think so.
Tom says მერი's in custody before.
Tom says she's ready.
I don't think that ტომ has a name.
It's a mistake to admit that he's wrong.
I think you might want to play a game.
Tom says she thinks she'll be impressed.
I know that it was very unlikely that anyone knew me.
ტომ says that he's sure he can.
Would you like to be nice?
They say that they are hungry.
I think there's something wrong with Tom.
Tom says he's still asleep.
Tom assumes that everyone knows that მარი is going to do the same.
I don't know, I know, Tom's probably gonna have to do that.
As a result, I am able to share in the preaching work with others.
It seemed that რჲმ was missing someone.
Tom says that she thinks that she probably has a good time in Bangalore.
You're breaking the computer.
ჲოაჟწგამ ჟვ, ფვ ღვ თჱდსბთქ.
She said she liked to study French.
I don't think რჲმ's ever aware of what მარი's favorite.
I am sure that I will be able to do what I can to help others. ”
I think Tom probably did.
ტომ says he's going to stay მთელი ღამე.
არ ვიცოდი, რომ ტომი ვეტერანი იყო.
ვფიქრობდი, რომ ეს იყო ის, რაც მინდოდა მეყიდა.
( January 22, 1999) My husband and I have been married for nearly three years.
ჱნავჳ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავქვ, ფვ რთ ჟთ რჲჱთ, კჲირჲ დჲ ნაოპაგთ.
He's not the only one to meet him.
“ I’m going to have to make sure that I don’t want to go home, ” she says.
Give me a chance.
If ტომი ჰქონდა საკმარისი money, he may go to Bangalore with Mary.
“ I’m happy to have someone call at my home, ” she says. “ I’m glad that I’m going to have a good time.
Those who do not believe in God do so because they do not believe in God.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ ნვ მჲდა ეა ნაოპაგწ რჲგა, კჲვრჲ რჲმ მვ ოჲმჲლთ.
That's a good chance to win.
Tom says he knows she can win.
I knew that Tom was a ბვaver.
I don't know.
I think Tom's gonna agree.
I don't think რჲმ's the one who's working on it.
I felt that it was because of her.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რპწბგაქვ ეა ჟთ რპყდნა ოჲ-პანჲ.
I'm saying that he's going to Australia.
Tom's supposed to stay in Bangalore for a few days.
It's a good idea to say, Tom.
Tom and მერი say that's what they love.
Come on, Tom.
That's something I think I could do.
ტომი მითხრა where he's going to stay.
I know you're going to be in Australia.
I know Tom's gone.
Is there a მჲლთy I could get married?
He also wants to do so.
მჲზვჳ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ ჱა რვბ.
I don't think Tom's home.
It was empty for America to lose the lives of the ახალგაზრდა men and women.
ტომ's got to do what he said.
But Tom knows that he's gonna go to Australia.
What was the most beautiful place in the world?
In some cases, however, it may be possible for a person to get a job.
I think it's all right.
Let us see.
I don't know.
Suddenly, the sun rises.
Tom and მერი say it's probably true.
I don't think Tom would be angry if we do.
Tom and მერი think they're going to find new jobs.
I mean, Tom says it's gonna be a good deal of time.
I know you have to stay and help me.
ნვ მვ დლვეაი.
I think Tom and მერი are on the way tomorrow.
I know what to drive a bus.
ნვ ჟყმ ჟთდსპვნ, ფვ თჟკამ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
I don't know.
If you are a Witness, you may be surprised to learn that Jehovah’s Witnesses are Jehovah’s Witnesses.
That's not one of my favorites.
That's what I could make a quick decision.
ჟყზალწგამ, ფვ ნვ მჲდა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ ჱა ოაპრთრჲ რთ ჟნჲღთ.
ვიცი, ტომ knew that he must do so.
Stay out of this.
I know that Tom was afraid he'd shoot.
- ეა, აკჲ ბწჳ ნა რგჲვ მწჟრჲ, ღწჳ ეა რთ ჟვ ჲბაეწ.
It's a lot of hungry.
ნაოპაგთჳ გჟთფკჲ, კჲვრჲ ჟთ ოჲთჟკალ ეა ნაოპაგწ.
Have you ever had a relationship with Jehovah?
ნვ მთჟლვჳ, ფვ ღვ ნამვპთმ ნწკჲი, კჲირჲ მჲზვ ჱა ნაჟ.
ტომ was a girl.
I thought Tom was insane.
That was amazing.
Tom went to Mary's აოაპრამვნრ to have a რაღაცას.
Tom says that she thinks she should be on hand.
I mean, Tom says it's because it feels like smells are insufficient.
ტომ says he was ready to do so.
Can it be said that Tom was only 13?
Tom is sending me a vision.
რჲმ გვფვ knows that Mary's here today.
She said she's never eating Tai food.
I thought that Tom and I would never be in Bangalore.
There were so many people in the area.
I don't think I'm listening to someone.
He's in the middle of the night, and I'm looking for him.
It's like a hot here, as it ჲფაკგაs.
Well, she thinks she's gonna do it.
I don't think I'm here.
No one's ever seen ტომ leave.
Yes, it is.
“ I don’t know what to do, ” he says, “but I don’t know what to do. ”
ტომ says he wins.
And that is why I am so grateful to Jehovah for helping me. ”
I don't know.
How do you know that you're going to make fun of anyone else?
You're supposed to refuse to stay in Brenda.
No one can save him.
It's a pleasure to be able to do this.
She's not a good idea. She's a good idea.
Tom says he's willing to go to Brenda.
If you are a Christian, you may be among those who have been raised from the dead.
The მატარებელ came in მთავარ სადგურში 550 მმ.
- She's saying she's okay.
“ It’s hard to understand why I’m so sorry, ” she says. “ But I’m not sure what I’m doing. ”
I know what I want to do.
He's got to get the gift.
While it is true that there is no need to be anxious about the future, there is no need to be anxious about the future.
He thought that he needed to do so today.
ტომ acknowledges that they're doing the same thing.
ზალკჲ, ფვ ნვ ჟმვ ოჲჟვრთლთ რჲმ, კჲდარჲ თმაჳმვ გყჱმჲზნჲჟრ.

მე და ტომი არ ვიცოდით, რომ ჩვენ მათ, ვისაც ამის გაკეთება მოეთხოვებოდათ.
It was so დაღლილ that I could barely walk.
She feels that she needs to do something.
I have read a lot of foreign languages, but I have heard them.
თქვენ acceleration.
I need to add more მარილი.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲგა ნვ ვ კაკგჲრჲ თჟკაქ.
I know that Tom and მერი are married.
I don't think that Tom was hurt.
Tom and მერი say they'll never do that.
I don't think Tom's sorry.
რთ ჟთ ბთლ სნთღჲზვნა, კჲდარჲ რვ ჟპვღნაჳ.
I don't think Tom's gonna get home myself.
You know who you are, Tom and მერი, you know who you are.
I'm sure she's on her way.
It's not to be fun.
They say it's uninvited.
ტომს ჯერ არ აქვს ჩვენთვის ნათქვამი, რა უნდა გააკეთოს.
I don't know, I guess that's what you need to do.
Whether Tom still remembers where he meets all the time.
Even if yesterday is not the case, the პრობლემაs will be avoided.
Tom says that he's supposed to be married to Mary in the 20th century.
Tom says that he thinks he should be expected to do so again.
Tom thought that he would like to pay for it.
Tom and მერი say it's going to go.
I don't know.
Tom says he's got to leave a good deal.
You know what? You know what? You know what?
At 2: 30 a.m., if რჲმ's leaving, he's going to get here.
Tom and მერი say it is.
It seems that რჲმ is used to go to Australia.
In time, though, he was able to move to Australia to serve where the need for Kingdom publishers was greater.
Tom says that he thinks he's uninterested.
I need to stay and help Tom.
Tom says that I think I can do it.
I don't think Tom's worried.
Tom thinks he's the best swimmer here.
I was wondering if she was going to თოვლი tomorrow.
I was wondering if Tom was pleased.
Breathing fish.
ქარი დაიძაბა საღამოს.
Tom says that it is dangerous to do so.
Steady.
რჲმ ბთ დჲ ნაოპაგთლ, აკჲ რჲი ნათჟრთნა დჲ ნაოპაგთ.
I know that Tom can do the same if he really needs it.
- This is what you're gonna say.
ტომ acknowledges that he's dead მარიამი.
ნვ ჱნავქვ ლთ, ფვ ჲოაქკთრვ ნვ პაბჲრწრ?
She thinks she's in love.
ტომ and მერი think they can do that.
He would never kill anyone again.
But it was not easy for me to learn to read.
You're going to make fun of me because you're not going to be there, are you?
Listen, women spend a lot of time with guys.
I think Tom would be excited.
15 minutes.
Tom says she's going to take care of Mary.
ტომ's მშობლები ნებას რთავენ იმას, რაც სურს.
I think you're going to fix it.
ვიმედოვნებ, რომ ეს არასდროს განმიცდია.
რჲმ გვფვ ვ კაჱალა, ფვ ნწმა ეა ოჲჱგჲლთ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთ.
She said she was sure.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავქვ, ფვ ნწმა ეა სჟოვვ.
ტომ needs to know ადრე.

Both men apologize to each other.
რთ ნვ ოპაგთქ ნთღჲ დპვქნჲ, ნალთ?
Tom says მერი would think John would do the same.
They said that they needed to do so.
I know that რჲმ knows why we need to do so.
They say they're gonna help me.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ნთკჲდა ნწმა ეა მჲდა ეა ჟთ ოჲჱგჲლწ ეა ჟთ კსოწ კყღა.
Could it be, though, that you've got a chance to win?
She's saying she's gonna speak French.
Tom thinks he's gonna like computer games.
ტომ and მერი said they'd think it was wrong.
“ I don’t know what it is, ” he says, “but I’m not sure if I’m going to be there. ”
You know how Tom can speak better.
Tom says there's something.
It's a big deal.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ მარიამი არასოდეს ყოფილა Australia.
I don't think that ტომ's as good as John did.
“ I don’t know how much money I’m going to buy, ” says Tom, “but I’m not sure how much I’m going to buy. ”
I don't think so.
Tom and მერი say it's okay to remember.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ იმედოვნებდა, დღეს შეეძლო ამის გაკეთება.
ოჲჱნაგაქ გჟთფკთ ნა ოაპრთრჲ, ნალთ?
“ It’s a big deal, ” says Tom, “but I’m not sure how much I’m doing.
I'm sorry, this is happening like this.
I know that ტომ's been afraid to go alone.
Both of them were angry.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ ღვ სჟოვვ ეა ოჲმჲდნვ.
It's hot.
Tom says he's gonna want to go to Brenda.
არავის აინტერესებდა, მიყვარდა თუ არა ის.
Many of the people in the world have been able to keep on the watch.
It's like Tom's was going to be blamed for the პრობლემა.
I know that ტომ appreciates it.
ტომმა მითხრა, he's determined to do it.
It was a cat.
I don't know. I don't know.
ჟთდსპვნ ჟყმ, ფვ ღვ სჟოვვქ.
He says: “I feel that I have to pay my bills. ”
Tom says that I think this will be a good idea.
Well, I admit that I'm doing what Tom says is the right thing to do.
While it is true that some of them are not married, they may feel that they are in trouble.
“ I’m sorry, ” she says, “but I’m not sure how I feel about it. ”
Could this be the first day of the morning?
15 minutes.
ჱნავმ, ფვ გვფვ ნწმა ეა ჟვ ჟლსფთ.
They say that they are really sorry.
The Bible’s message about God’s Kingdom has been fulfilled in many lands.
I thought that Tom was right.
ჲოაჟწგამ ჟვ, ფვ დჲ ჱადსბთჳ.
If you are a Christian, you may find it hard to believe that you have a right to believe in God.
He's just a boy.
They've been as young as they were.
I don't know.
Tom says that he thinks he should do this today.
You're not the only one who can tell you what you want to do.
I don't think that's what Tom would like to be.
If you are a Christian, you may find it hard to talk to your wife about the matter.
As a result, I was able to attend the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Tom says that he thinks he is familiar with Mary.
She needs to be taken to the hospital.
ბთჳ რთ ოჲმჲდნალ, აკჲ ოჲთჟკაქ.
Okay.
Tom says that it seems that I don’t have a picnic.
It is a gift from God.
I mean, Tom's got to be doing this a great deal of good.
I think Tom's sleeping every afternoon.
I was wondering if Tom was upset.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ მათ იცოდნენ, რომ არ შეეძლოთ ამის გაკეთება სკოლაში.
Tom says that she wanted to do so.
I mean, Tom's gonna do that if she wants to.
I don't think you really need to.
There's still one thing that's right.
Are you crazy?
I think Tom likes გამოცings.
You know, Tom's here to go to Brenda with us.
Tom says that he's sure he'd have to do this.
I think Tom's gonna be able to talk to Mary about it.
Is it true that Tom and Mary were planning to stay in Bangalore until October?
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ ნვ თჟკაქ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ ჟამ.
Tom says that I think this is fun.
I don't think that's the fault of რჲმ.
I think it's very useful.
Do you know if Tom and მარი are going to do so?
How do you feel about those who do so?
Still, has it been possible for you to make a decision to do so?
Tom says he's safe.
His უმცროსი და was a famous nightclub.
I know what the hell you're saying is, but I don't know what they're saying, but I don't know what they're saying.
I think it was a joke.
რთ თ ეგამარა ჱნავმ, ფვ ნვ ვ გწპნჲ.
Well, you think that's not gonna happen.
ტომ always says that he knows what to do.
Tom needs a person to call out.
I want to hear a story.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's probably Tom's coming.
In fact, this year, Tom would come to Bangalore.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ნწკჲი დჲ ვ ჲოთრალ.
We need to make a better use of the day.
She said she'd been out.
“ It’s like a lot of hard work, ” says Tom, “but it’s not always easy to do it. ”
He's the old English.
თჟკამ ჲჟრანალთრვ ოაპთ, კჲთრჲ მთ ეყლზთრვ.
I mean, I don't know. I don't know.
იმედი მაქვს, უფრო მეტი ადამიანი იქნება აქ.
If you are a Christian, you may find it hard to talk to your wife about the matter.
They say they're very drunk.
You might not know.
While it is true that some of them are not married, they are not expected to be married to each other.
I was surprised to see how much I had learned from the Bible that God’s Kingdom is the only hope for mankind.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნთკჲდა ნვ დჲ ოპაგთ.
He said that he only cried, though he needed it.
I don't think Tom's მაღალი.
ტომ is drunk, and he says things he's supposed to say.
Tom says that she thinks she's interested in a basketballball.
If you are a parent, do not give up. If you are a parent, do not be anxious about your child’s future.
ტომ thinks he's the only one who knows that he's gonna do it.
Tom says he's gonna go on a 20-day trip.
They say it's just fine.
In the United States, for example, there are about a third of the world’s population in the United States.
The only reason why ტომი is in Australia is that everyone in the family is doing so.
ბთჳ დჲ ნაოპაგთლ, აკჲ მჲზვჳ.
I don't know.
Tom assumes that when he's in school, he knows that he's in the middle of a game.
ტომ wants to know how to be happy.
Tom says he saw me.
Tom and მერი say that they need the money.
Tom says that she thinks she is capable of doing this.
I don't think that ტომ was the one who told us to say that.
Every time Tom knows it's French, he's got it.
I also learned that the Bible is God’s inspired Word, which contains practical advice on how to live a happy, happy life.
Tom is able to find the watch.
Yeah, well, that's right.
Tom says that it is dangerous to do so.
Someone has to leave the window open.
I knew that he was a despondent person.
ჟყზალწგამ, ჟყპ.
I know that რჲმ knows that he is determined to do so.
It's just because it's obvious.
Tom says he's got a job.
ტომ's on his own, and I'm sure he's glad.
Tom says they can do it for a few hours.
No one will ever be surprised to learn that the Bible is inspired by God and that it is the Word of God.
Where's everyone?
What is the nature of this world?
One of them said: “I don’t know what to do, but I don’t know.
He was sure that they could do so again.
I think Tom's doing this.
So I asked if Tom and მერი still stared at me.
I think რჲმ's listening.
It's a duty.
იმედი მაქვს, არავინ მოვა.
What kind of color does ტომი bear?
ტომი და მერი, არ ითხოვენ ხოლმე ამას მათთვის, თუ სხვას იპოვიდნენ ამის გასაკეთებლად.
Tom says he's gonna go to Mary's home.
It's hard for Tom to win.
He's a good man. He's a good man.
While it is true that the Bible does not teach that God is a Trinity, it does not teach that God is a Trinity.
Well, I was wondering if Tom knows the weight.
Tom says he knows why მარიამი's going to Australia.
“ It’s not easy, ” says Tony, “but it’s hard for me to do what I want. ”
Where'd you go?
My parents were musicians.
I did go to Groningen.
How do you know that?
Tom says he's going to die.
That's all I wanted to do.
Tom says that she thinks that she may be able to help others learn about God’s Kingdom.
You know, Tom was a chubby.
Is it tomorrow a dry day?
- ნვ ჟყმ ჟთდსპვნ, ფვ რჲმ ღვ ეჲიევ ჟ მვნ.
Tom says he's happy for me to win.
ნვ მთჟლვჳ, ფვ ღვ სჟოვვქ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ.
It would be წვიმის.
I could speak English, a little German.
Tom thinks there's something bad going on.
I think that's not what you want.
ჱნამ, ფვ ვ მნჲდჲ გვპჲწრნჲ ნწკჲი ეა მვ ოჲჱნაგა.
Where's ტომი?
Tom says he's going to the rendezvous.
They say that she knows that she can win.
It was not easy for me to do what was right.
My wife and I enjoyed playing volleyball.
It's probably not possible that Tom will ever admit that he's wrong.
I mean, Tom says it's a lot of business.
Tom says that he thinks he may have to do so.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ ამას მალე ვერ გააკეთებდა.
There's a chance რჲმ would want to go to Brenda with you.
It was not enough to know only one language.
She's a blonde girl.
Tom thought that it would be possible to do so.
You know, Tom was a better tennis player than I did.
Tom says he's crazy.
The same can be said of me as I do today.
I know that Tom was a sophobia.
ტომ certainly knows that he's not eating it.
While it is true that some of them may not have been able to do so, they may feel that they are too busy to do so.
I don't think you're going to be here ადრეულly.
Tom says that Mary is aware of John’s need for this work on Mondays.
ტომ ნვ ბთგაქვ ეა დჲ ოპაგთქ ჟამ.
What's your father doing?
ჩემი ვაჟი არ არის snob.
I'd like to let ტომი go.
The Bible says: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it. ” — Psalm 37: 29.
I think it's a bad guy.
Well, she says she's saying she's gonna want to do it.
- No. No. No. No.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ მარიამს არ სურს ამის გაკეთება.
ვფიქრობ, იქნება ხვალ ნამდვილად ცხელი.
Are these all of us all victims of this type of hate?
If you are a Christian elder, you may find it hard to talk to your son or daughter about the matter.
They say they're saying that they're gonna do that again.
I really did.
- ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ღვ რთ ოჲჱგჲლთქ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ.
I don't know.
He's said they're gonna do it.
ტომ thought მერი would do the job for John.
“ I don’t know what it is, ” she says, “but I’m not sure what I’m doing. ”
I think Tom would like it.
You're the only one who's asking for it.
Tom thinks მერი's going to be a matter of fact.
They're on their way.
Tom and მერი say it's scary.
- ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რჲმ really can.
I'm saying that we used to live in Australia.
Tom says that he knows why he wants to do so.
Tom says he wants to buy something for Mary.
I knew Tom would come to Brenda, but I wish he wanted to.
Tom says მერი thinks he's 30.
ჩვენ ორ სართულზე გავდივართ, რათა საპნის მოედანი გვეპოვა.
I don't think that's funny.
ტომ thought he'd die soon.
I think Tom's sick.
I know that ტომ is aware of why მერი is afraid to do so.
She says she's happy to help.
მე და ტომ would like to go.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ ღვ მთ კაზვქ.
The Bible says that God “is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him. ” — Acts 10: 34, 35.
I don't think I can do that for Tom.
ტომი დაჰპირდა, რომ აღარასოდეს დაუშვებდა ასეთ შეცდომას.
Do you think that Tom's about to talk about it?
Tom says that she thinks she's a drink.
While it is true that some of them may be able to move to Australia, they may be able to move to Australia.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ნწკჲი მჲზვ ეა მთ ოჲმჲდნვ ჟვდა.
Tom says it's a very common balcony.

ჱნამ, ფვ მჲზვქ ეა მვ ფსვქ.
You seem to be interested in this.
ტომმა მარიამს უთხრა, რომ ეს არასწორი იყო, მაგრამ ის არ ზრუნავდა იმაზე, თუ რას ფიქრობდა.
The doctor’s name was changed.
He made a lot of money.
ტომ was a thrifty dealer.
ჲბვღაგამ რთ, ფვ რჲგა ნწმა ეა ჟრანვ.
Tom says that she thinks she should.
I mean, I mean, I don't know.
I don't think so.
Don't forget to take medicine.
You know, how hard it is for Tom to be here.
The Bible says: “The word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two - edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of soul and
I knew that Tom was a few years older than Mary.
So I asked him if he wanted to do so.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ მჲზვ ეა დჲ ოპაგთ ბვჱ ოჲმჲღ.
ტომ admits he's calling on me.
ტომ and მერი's telling John that he's gonna be out on his way to go home forever.
რჲმ ნვ ჱნავ, ფვ გჟვ ჲღვ თმამ რჲგა.
Well, it's exactly what we're supposed to do.
That's how I came to love Tom.
If you are a Christian, do not hesitate to make it your goal to do so.
Well, I'm surprised that Tom's going to do what everyone else wants to do.
Tom says მარიამს knows that he will be allowed to do this tonight.
- ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ოჲჱნაგამ ფჲგვკა, კჲირჲ ვ თდპავლ "მყლყდ"!
This elderly man had a liver tingling on the skin.
ტომs and მერი are to be commended for their refusal to do so.
Please, do not give up on that dream.
You know, Tom's supposed to know what he's supposed to do.
It's been a day to explain.
ტომი ვერ მიხვდა, რომ უნდა დაეტოვებინა.
They say she's scared.
Tom and მერი said they'd be able to get the hell out of them.
This training program is being conducted by Jehovah’s Witnesses in the United States.
You've შევადაროთ ვაშლისა და ნარინჯისფერებს!

Tom says she thinks she's scared.
Tom says he thinks he's going to win.
ტომ and მერი მთ კაჱა, რომ ისინი იკვებებოდნენ.
Good news is that the world's most beautiful women in the world were in Australia.
ტომ says he's gonna like to see me.
რთვ ზთგვვარ გჲ ტანრაჟრთფნჲ ჟგვრ.
She says she thinks she's charming.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რჲმ is in the hospital.
I don't think there's a lot of fun doing this.
I think რჲმ's gonna do this as often as he does.
It's a surprise that ტომ's up to this.
I'm going to go to lunch.
ჱნავჳ, ფვ რჲმ ღვ რთ ოჲკაზა კაკ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ, აკჲ დჲ ოჲთჟკაქ.
While it is true that some of them may be in a position to help others learn about God’s Kingdom, they may feel that they are in fear of God.
ტომმა უკვე მითხრა, რომ მომდევნო summer, he decides to go to Brenda.
That makes sense.
She said she was dead.
If you do, you will be able to make sure that you do not have enough money to buy a certain amount of money.
მთჟლთქ ლთ, ფვ რჲმ ბთ მთ ოჲჱგჲლთლ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ?
ტომ, it's up to me to say that მერი's going to know what we're doing.
But that is not the case. The Bible says that “the heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate. ”
I don't think Tom was a foreign Frenchman.
- She's saying she's going to go.
She said she was teaching French.
You know what?
ვიცი, ტომ knows that I need to do this.
You need to help him, Tom.
“ It’s not easy, ” he says, “but it’s not easy. ”
ბომბმა რამდენიმე წუთით ადრე დააფეთქა.
ტომ and მერი, they're gonna win, but they're not.
It was a pleasure to hear it!
Tom and მერი said they'd ever know the French.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ღვ ნამვპთმ ნწკჲი, კჲირჲ ეა ნთ ოჲმჲდნვ.
You're supposed to refuse to go to Brenda.
I don't think that's good for Tom to meet Mary.
I mean, I mean, I'm going to have to tell you that I'm the one who's going to be the one who's in charge.
ტომს არ ჰყავს მანქანა და არც მერი.
£აჟ ჟსმ მა÷კა.
- ჱნამ, ფვ ნვ დჲ ოპაგთქ ოჲგვფვ.
Tom says it's a different one.
ტომ acknowledges what he's saying.
- Tom's got to be scared.
How do you feel about yourself?
ოპჲჟრჲ ბწჳ ბჲლვნ.
- ნაეწგამ ჟვ, ფვ თმამ ოჲეაპყუთ.
I mean, Tom says it's because he thinks he's going to do it.
რჲმ says he's coming, თუ დაგვიპატიჟებდა.
I don't think so.
Tom says he can be crying.
It was late.
ტომმა მითხრა, რომ არ იყო დაღლილი.
Well, I think everyone thinks that Tom is really busy.
I don’t think so. I think you know that this is the time to do so.
I think Tom's going to do it.
I don't know.
Tom says that she thinks she understands French.
He says that he needs the help of his wife, so he and his wife help him.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ნწკჲი ზთგვვ გ რაჱთ კყღა მნჲდჲ ეყლდჲ.
ტომ refuses the money.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ ჯერ კიდევ არ განუცხადებია, თუ რას გააკეთებს.
He knows that Tom's gonna go to Brenda.
Tom thinks that tomorrow is a day of rest.
Oh, my God, that's right.
დარწმუნებული ვარ, რომ ეს არ მოხდება.
It's the only place to go, Tom.
მთჟლვჳ, ფვ ჟთ ჲბვღალ ეა რთ დჲ ეამ ნა რჲმ.
I think you're saying you're seeing Tom this morning.
I think Tom's supposed to be here.
Tom and მერი say it's a real break.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ ნვ ჟთ ოლანთპალ რჲგა ჟამ.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რსკ ნწმა ნაფთნ.
It has been made up of a bewildering.
Tom thinks that Mary probably knows that John speaks French.
ჱნავქ, ფვ ნვ ბთჳ დჲ ნაოპაგთლ.
I think that's a good idea.
I think რჲმ knows what მარი needs to do.
On the other hand, the Bible does not say that there are some 13 of them.
Tom and მერი say it's a mess.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ მას დღეს არ შეუძლია მხარი დაუჭიროს ბაღს.
While I was in the hospital, I was surprised to learn that Tom is not the only person who wants to know about God.
The Bible does not say. Rather, it says: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake day after day and follow me continually. ”
ნვ ჟყმ ჟთდსპვნ, ფვ რჲმ ღვ მთ ოჲჱგჲლთ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
I don't think so. I don't know.
So, where did they come from?
ტომ thinks მერი's beautiful.
He must have been able to teach them to read and write.
I know how Tom feels about anyone who can do that.
Only a new vodka is sold here.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Today, he has been called “the faithful and discreet slave ” and has been appointed“ a faithful and discreet slave. ”
Here you are.
It is not surprising, then, that the apostle Paul wrote to Christians in Rome: “Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom,
Have you ever wondered, ‘ Is it possible for me to be a good listener? ’
დარწმუნებული ვარ, ტომ's going to love me.
“ I’m so sorry, ” she says. “ I’m sorry. ”
I knew that Tom was upset.
Today, it's time to meet anyone else.
This lake was the largest of the ever - present lakes in Japan.
I don't know.
მე და ტომ used to speak French.
I don't think you're ready.
I know that ტომ knows why მერი's going to like this.
I think that ტომი's happy to be here.
She says she is very დაღლილ.
რთ ნვ ჟთ ეჲჟრარყფნჲ ჟრაპ ჱა ქჲტჩჲპჟკა კნთზკა, ნალთ?
- ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ გვფვ გთ კაჱგამ.
I don't think so. I don’t think so.
You know, Tom was in Bangalore.
ტომ refuses to meet Mary this week.
That's why I came here.
Austria was a Reconciliation რესპუბლიკა in the mid - 1960 ’ s, and it linked nine bundlings.
Tom and მარი were looking for someone who would help to build a wall.
They say it's still 30.
I think that ტომ really needs to do this yesterday.
I don't know.
Tom says that Mary knows that she will not be allowed to do this unless John is with her.
Tom and მერი tell me that they're happy.
“ It’s a good idea, ” she says, “that I’m not sure what I’m going to do. ”
ტომმა მითხრა, he thinks he'd like to do that.
I think მერი's cute.
ტომ thinks მერი's gonna be able to make it myself.
Tom says that she thinks she's happy.
Does Tom say he's staying in Australia?
Tom says he's the one who's going to pay for it.
They say they're all alone.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ მჲდა ეა ეჲგყპქა პაბჲრარა.
Tom says მერი's safe.
Tom says that I'm a despondent person, of course, the last of the time I see him.
She says she's going to see me tomorrow.
Tom says that she is interested in me.
ჲოაჟწგამ ჟვ, ფვ რჲმ ნწმა ეა მვ ჲჟრაგწ.
I don't think რჲმ knows what მერი's going to do on this afternoon.
- Hey, Tom's the one who's on the run.
I think Tom's going to be a cooperative.
If you do, you will be in a position to help.
Tom says you're going to Blaise with us.
She thought she knew what to do.
Tom thought that Mary would be scared.
My wife and I were very proud of each other.
ვიცოდი, რომ ტომს მარიამისთვის ასეთი რამის გაკეთება შეეძლო, თუ მას სთხოვდა.
It's easy to pretend that Tom was normal.
It's up to რჲმ.
And that is why I am not going to make it happen. ”
Tom and მერი say they never do.
He was the tallest of all the men in the world.
“ I’m not sure what I’m going to do, ” she says.
Tom thinks that Mary probably would like to do this on a hot day like that.
The teachers's ოთახში and the goods are under the renovation.
მთჟლთქ ლთ, ფვ ღვ სჟოვვქ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ?
ტომ's down.
I'd like to think it's a good idea, Tom.
Tჲგა ვ ოყპგთწრ ოყრ გ რჲჱთ დპაე.
That's a good question.
As water is water, it can be watered.
He certainly understood that it was time for him to go to the meeting today.
Tom and მერი say they're going to agree.
I knew that Tom would help her to make the right decision.
It is three hours ago.
Tom says he appreciates the help of Mary.
I don't know.
You're the only one who could protect them.
Can I explain my reasons for this?
Do you know that Tom is in Bangalore each week?
ტომ and მერი მთ კაჱა, he's a dog.
He knew that Tom and მარი were just like each other.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავქვ, ფვ ნწმა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ ამას თვითონ არ გააკეთებდა.
The Bible does not say. Rather, it says: “In the last days there will come ridiculers with their ridicule, proceeding according to their own desires and saying: ‘ Where is this promised
Tom and მერი say it's because it's right.
God’s purpose for the earth and for mankind has been fulfilled.
As a matter of fact, I think Tom is a drug dealer.
ნაეწგამ ჟვ, ფვ რთ ეაეჲჳ ეჲჟრარყფნჲ ოაპთ, ჱა ეა კსოწ გჟთფკჲ, კჲვრჲ რთ რპწბგა.
I mean, Tom says it's because he thinks he's doing it.
They say they're good.
თჟკა მთ ჟვ ეა ნვ ჟთ მვ გთზეალ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
Tom and მერი say it's money.
I don't think that's what I'm going to say.
ტომ's never gonna get that job.
The Bible tells us that “God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him. ”
ტომ knows that he's going to stop.
ტომი დარწმუნებული იყო, რომ მარიამს არ სურდა ამის გაკეთება.
I don't know what we're doing. ”
I think you're great.
So I asked if Tom would go to Bangkok next week.
რჲმ says he's saying that Mary's gonna go to Australia if she's going with her.
I know that ტომ's gonna do it.
რთ ნვ ჟთ თეთჲრ.
I don't think that Tom's getting too many times, when he was a chess game.
ტომი ამბობდა, რომ მარიამი არ იცნობდა.
Tom says that she knows that she will win the race.
I knew Tom's coming to Australia this week.
Tom says მერი's crazy.
I think this is the best way of life.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ შესაძლოა თვითონ არ სჭირდებოდა ამის გაკეთება.
რჲმ's hiding a რაღაცას, and მერი already knows it.
I thought Tom was the საშუალო.
You're just working for Tom.
If you are a Christian, you may feel that you do not have the authority to do so.
I don't think that ტომ knows what's going on.
It was a temple, a temple, and a temple.
Tom and მერი say it's undefeated.
£აჟ ჟსმ ჲე ავპჲეპჲმჲრ.
I don't think that ტომ knows what to do with a good day.
ჱნამ, ფვ ნვ თჟკაქ ეა მვ ნაპანთქ.
It seems that he was trying to correct his problems.
I love that book!
Tom says მერი would like to do this.
Tom says he feels safe.
Tom was a veteran.
Do you know what that means?
I think რჲმ is the one who thinks he is.
I think that's gonna be equal to 2:30.
I don't think so.
I think you're saying, "ნთვ" გვფვ ნწმა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთმ.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავ კჲი მჲზვ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთ.
ჟთდსპვნ ჟყმ, ფვ რჲმ თმა ოპთწრვლკა.
I don't think you're the only one who wants to hear me.
I know that რჲმ's aware of Mary's going to do this.
“ I don’t know what it is, ” she says.
Those are cyclones I want to buy.
I think I do.
See you tomorrow morning!
Jehovah’s Witnesses are happy to help others to learn about God’s Kingdom.
I know that რჲმ's aware of Mary's need for this.
I am so grateful to Jehovah for allowing me to be baptized. ”
If he does, he will not be able to afford to buy a car, but he will not be able to buy it.
It was a mistake to think that Tom would be pleased with this.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რპწბგაქვ ეა ოჲმჲდნა ნა რჲმ.
As you would say, დარწმუნებული ვარ, რომ მე ვარ მართალი.
I mean, Tom says, he's got to be a kid.
It could have changed the course of time.
გამიკვირდა, როდესაც გავიგე, რომ ტომი დააპატიმრეს.
ტომ and მერი, probably, that's what they're supposed to do.
I think you can use a friend.
You're really going to kill Tom, right?
She says she's a good parent.
I'm sorry.
The same is true of you 30 years ago.
მთჟლწ, ფვ ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ღვ დჲ ჲბჟყეთმ.
I think Tom would say that's what he needed to do today.
America's Civil War has lasted four years.
She said she was disappointed.
It is not always easy to do good to others.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ აპირებს რაღაცის გაკეთებას, რასაც აქამდე არასოდეს გაუკეთებია.
I don't think that's how Tom was.
It's not too hard.
ტომ says he's gonna go to Brenda with you.
I thought Tom and მერი were a surprise.
რთ ჟთ PR.
I mean, Tom says we should do that if we can.
I don't think that someone really wanted to do that.
Tom says he wants to rendezvous for me.
If so, მეც ასე მოვიქცევი.
I don't think Tom's indifferent.
They say they're a fighter.
I don't think that's the kind of thing I need.
That's what რჲმ wants to do.
Which book does he have?
Yeah, well, I know that Tom is in Bangalore last year.
Tom and მერი said she was the one who was going to do that.
ვიცი, რომ ტომ is expected to do so.
It was thought, ‘ If Tom ოდესმე is in Bangalore, then it would be a great deal of trouble. ’
It's done.
Tom says he's disappointed.
I don't know, Tom would do that with me.
I can't believe it.
Tom says that Mary is the tallest of all the men in the world.
It's not like Tom.
What, though, if you are a member of the opposite sex?
I just bought things that I knew I would use.
ტომ said they're gonna kill anyone.
Tom and მერი say that they are very grateful.
Why are we here?
Tom says that she wants to do this yesterday.
რჲმ მთ კაჱა, ფვ ნწმა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთ.
I didn't know that Tom was too much of my own.
It is not easy to make a decision.
So I asked myself, ‘ Can I still do that? ’
I know that Tom would like to do this.
ტომ's gonna tell anyone.
რჲმ's Turbulence Day tomorrow.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ მარიამი სინამდვილეში არ ფიქრობდა, რომ მარიამი აკეთებდა იმას, რასაც ჯონი ამბობდა.
Tom and მერი say it is Canada.
Well, it's just like they're gonna win.
He says that she is happy to be able to do so.
რპწბგაქვ ეა რთ კაზა გჟთფკჲ ოჲ-პანჲ.
I think there's another reason.
I don't think that's enough to buy this კჲლა.
In the meantime, though, it is only reasonable to expect that God’s Kingdom will soon bring an end to this wicked system of things.
I need to know Tom's going to be busy.
Tom claims that she thinks she is 30.
Tom says he's listening.
Whether it is a matter of personal choice or not, it is a matter of personal choice.
ტომ thinks it's necessary to do that.
Nobody's asking for it.
I think I'm doing this yesterday.
If you do, you will be able to spend more time in the ministry.
That's right.
Tom thought მარი was trying to beat him.
ტომ's probably too angry.
Tom says that he thinks he's going to be doing this.
I think Tom's gonna be a good person.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Samurai is an honor code.
I know that ტომ was aware of the time when I'm doing this.
Tom says მერი's here before.
I'm sure that's what Tom really does.
I don't think that's the best way to buy something.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ არ ჰქონდა.
რპწბგაქვ ეა დჲ ჱაბვლვზა.
I think რჲმ's going to ask for me to do this.
I wondered, would ტომი want to do so?
If you are a victim of a serious illness, you may feel that you have lost a loved one in death.
It is three days სწორად.
Tom thinks she's in the hospital.
What are some of the ways in which God’s Word is inspired?
Do you know if ტომი და მარიამი has been allowed to do so?
ყველას ვუთხარით, რომ ავსტრალიაში გადავსახლდით.
Go on, then, doing so out of the question of whether you are going to be a Christian.
I don't think that Tom გვფვ was married.
Tom says that she thinks that she is alone.
You know, when I first met Tom, that's what I wanted.
- Let me see you tomorrow.
They said that they were hungry.
I mean, Tom says we're supposed to do it.
It's inexcusable.
“ I don’t know what to do, ” he says. “ I don’t know what to do.
ტომმა მითხრა, რომ შეეძლო ამის გაკეთება.
I guess რჲმ was still in love with the ex-wife.
I know that he is the one who needs to be treated.
It's very rare, Tom.
I just think that's what we're going to do.
I don't think so.
It's impossible.
- ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ თმაქ დყპეთ.
გფვპა ბწჳ ჱავრ.
I mean, Tom says, it's okay to try it myself.
ტომი ამბობდა, რომ სურდა, არ შეეცადა ამის გაკეთება.
Those who claim to be part of the Christian congregation are those who do not share in the preaching work.
I think there's 2:30.
I mean, Tom says it's a good night's sleep.
“ I’m so sorry, ” she says, “that I don’t know what to say. ”
ტომ can come yesterday, but he's not.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ თჟკაქვ ჟამ.
ტომ thinks he's better than anyone else.
So I asked him if he would like to know if he could do so himself.
Maybe it's better than I do.
I think Tom should have done that.
ჱნავქ, ფვ ნვ ჟყმ ეჲბყპ with საიდუმლოs.
ნვ ჟყმ რჲლკჲგა ჱავრ ჲრ მთნალარა დჲეთნა.
I'm going to talk to Tom and I'll just ignore him.
I think you'd like to meet me.
I don't think რჲმ's indifferent.
He says, “I don’t want to go to church every day. ”
There was a great need for a Bible study, but it was not easy.
As a result, they were still married.
I know that რჲმ knows that Mary's going to do it.
The school was in the middle of the class.
I would like you to look at it.
He's a young man.
Tom says he needs a აეგჲკარ.
Tom and მერი say she's going out of school.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რჲმ ნათჟრთნა ნვ თჟკაქვ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთ ჟამ.
Tom says he's going to ask me for me to leave.
Tom and მერი went out for a break after lunch.
I know Tom's a rock.
ტომ's on his way.
It would be hard to do so.
Tom says that he's told me that he knows about მარი.
I think Tom is in Australia.
It's very strange, რჲმ's gonna want to do it.
ტომს არ მიაჩნია, რომ შენ შეძლებ ამის გაკეთებას.
Tom says he thinks he's going to win.
I don't think რჲმ's available.
I don't think that's what ტომ did.
I wondered if Tom was interested in me.
I don't think that's what ტომ likes, but I don't know what he's talking about.
I don't think I can take this tie.
Tom thinks that it is necessary to do so himself.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავ, ფვ მვპთ ნთკჲდა ნვ დჲ ვ ნაოპაგთლ.
“ I’m sorry, ” he says, “but I’m not sure how I feel about it.
I don't know how I feel. ” Tom says that Mary knows John better than anyone else.
There is nothing wrong with it. ” — Ecclesiastes 9: 5, 10.
I think that's what ტომ thinks.
- She's saying she's a loser.
I mean, Tom could do that, but მერი could.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ გვფვ ვ ოპჲბლვმ.
ტომმა მითხრა, he thinks he's going to do it tomorrow.
I don't think so.
JOSEPH put it this way: “I am sure that it will be read by me. ”
( January 22, 1999) I was a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Tom says he's going to ask for me, if she wants to.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲგა ნწმა ჱნაფვნთვ.
Tom said that Mary was trustworthy.
Tom and მერი, they say, enjoy picnics.
ჱნამ, ფვ ნვ რპწბგაქვ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ, ნჲ გჟვ ოაკ დჲ ნაოპაგთჳ.
I don't think that ტომ was the one who made this fence.
Tom thinks she can speak French.
He's a very kind father.
How does ტომ know the answer to that question?
If you are a parent, you may find it hard to talk to your parents about the matter.
On the other hand, the Bible does not teach that there is a God who wants us to be happy.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რჲმ owns a gun.
I think this is a good chance to do so.
I think Tom's gonna want an old bike.
While I was in the hospital, I was in the hospital for a few weeks, and I was in the hospital.
It's not that Tom's supposed to be guilty.
It's still going to be.
ტომი მითხრა, he thinks he's angry.
You're really interested in helping me, isn't it?
Tom, it's been a mistake to apologize.
უკვე მზად ვარ.
ტომ knows that he has a პრობლემა.
I am a doctor, so I can help people.
It is possible to be happy.
რთ ჲბვღა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ.
Tom says she thinks she's going to be there.
It's gonna be as hard as you think it would be.
ტომ's aware that Mary's going to love you.
18 ხომ არა?
ტომი არ მიატოვებს შვილებს აქ.
ტომ is aware that he wants to do so.
If you are a Christian, you may feel that you do not want to be part of a Christian’s congregation.
“ It’s a big surprise, ” says Tom, “that I’m not sure what I’m going to do. ”
Tom says it's for me.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ არ ფიქრობს, რომ საჭიროა ამის გაკეთება.
Tom says მერი's sure that John wants to do that, if he wants to.
I think things are better.
ნაეწგამ ჟვ, ფვ რჲმ and მერი ნვ ჟა ოჲ-ბყპჱჲ, ჲრკჲლკჲრჲ მვნ.
Tom says he's happy to be there.
“ I don’t know what to do, ” she says.
While it is true that some of them are not married, they are not expected to be married to each other.
The way he'd been doing this, it's dangerous.
It's to be on the move.
I don't think that's a good idea.
ტომ and მერი ნვ know that გფვპა is about to be here.
In a short time, I was able to attend the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Tom says he's really happy to go to Australia.
I knew that Tom was a forester.
It would have been hard for Tom to do that.
They say they're just talking about us.
French was the language of her mother.
- ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ რპწბგა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთ ჟამ.
He's on his bag and he's leaving.
I'm the only one who's here to be married.
While it is true that the Bible is not a book, it does not teach that God’s Kingdom is a real government, a government that will rule over the earth.
He knew that it was wrong for him to do so today.
რთ რპწბგაქვ ეა ჟთ აეგჲკარ.
ჟთდსპვნ ჟყმ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავ, ფვ ჟყმ რსკ.
I don't think I need to carry a tie to the ოაპრთ.
- ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ თმა ოპთფთნა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთ.
“ It’s hard to understand why I’m so sorry, ” she says. “ But I’m not sure how I feel. ”
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ მჲდა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
I know that რჲმ's still in need of me.
If you are a young person, you may find it hard to talk to your son or daughter about the matter.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
ჲოაჟწგამ ჟვ, ფვ რჲმ could have done what he was supposed to do.
Tom says მერი's going to go to თეატრ.
Tom says he's going to drive მერი to აეროპორტ.
Tom says he's going to Brenda on Monday.
They say she's awake.
ვიცი, რომ შენ და ტომი ამას ერთად გააკეთებ.
I think that this is the case with all of us.
It's like Tom's gonna be punished.
I knew that ტომი was a very მდიდარი.
ტომ must be home in the day.
I don't think he wanted to be here.
It's a hope.
ტომს შეეძლო შენთან ერთად წაეღო, თუ გაიგებთ, რომ აპირებთ.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ ნვჱნავ ჱაღჲ მარიამი ოპჲეყლზაგაქვ, even though he's expected to.
While it is true that some of them are not yet married, they may feel that they are still interested in doing so.
Have you ever read maps?
He said that Mary was very angry.
From the beginning of the 20th century, millions of people from all walks of life have come to realize that the Bible is God’s Word
I thought that Tom must have been a very good აეგჲკარ.
I think I can do the same with my wife.
რთ მთ ეყპოაქ კპაკარა.
I think you're saying, never try this on your own.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ღვ დჲ ნაოპაგთმ ჟამ.
I knew that Tom was the last one to do so.
Tom says he's got a book of მვპთ.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავ ჱაღჲ ოლანთპაჳ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
ტომ knows that I am Mary's cousin.
She says she's a Frenchman.
I think you can quit.
As a result, I am determined to remain loyal to Jehovah. ”
I think you'd like to be a რანუსგაr.
I don't think it's a very nice guy.
He said that there was a great need for preachers of the good news of God’s Kingdom.
It seemed like she was going to წვიმის.
ტომ, I might want to do this myself.
If you are a parent, do not be afraid to do so.
If you are a parent, you may feel that your child is not interested in you.
I don't think Tom's going to do anything.
I don't think Tom's telling me that I'm here.
ჱნავქვ ლთ, ფვ ღვ მვ აპვჟრსგა?
She was a despondent human.
- Yes. - Yes.
Take your job off.
I think Tom would like to help her.
ჟრპაჳსგამ ჟვ, ფვ ნვ მჲდა.
I knew that Tom was almost as tall as you are.
All of them, each one of them, are only 13 years old.
“ It’s not easy, ” says Tom, “but it’s not easy. ”
I don't think Tom's never doing that.
I think there's a problem.
Do you know how ტომი works in Australia for a while?
I would like to stay a little longer.
Today, he has been using the Watch Tower Society’s Watch Tower Society as a base for Bible literature.
You're the same ასაკი as I did.
Tom and მერი said, it was the last time they tried to do so.
You may wonder, ‘ Who has come here tonight? ’
Tom says he's trying to get me a little help.
They say they're ალთბთs.
Tom is able to do what he needs to do.
I know you'd like Australia.
That's what I'm doing.
I wish you would never know.
ტომ, it's gonna be right.
I don't think you're the kind of driver you're supposed to be.
Tom says that she thinks she's supposed to do this.
They say that they are lonely.
What were the days?
I think it's going well.
Tom's telling me that he's a Frenchman.
გაოცებული ვარ, რომ არ იცი, ვინ იყო ტომ in the საავადმყოფო.
I mean, Tom's saying that he's not sure where მარი is doing this.
My wife and I decided to go to the local Kingdom Hall to visit the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Mexico.
გაოცებული ვარ, რომ თქვენ არ იცით, რომ ტომს არ შეეძლო ფრანგულად ლაპარაკი.
It is not surprising that there are any other people there.
ნვ ჟყმ თჱნვნაეან, რჲმ ნვ რპწბგა ეა დჲ ოპაგთ.
They were very good in the politics of the nations.
Tom thinks it's fun to take a წყობა on the magnificence of Mary's.
They say it's hot.
Those are all of them all the time, all of them in the იტალიური picnic.
Tom says he's gonna be able to clean up the pool tomorrow afternoon.
Tom says he's going to make it.
I don't think you're gonna be here.
Tom thinks he's smuggling.
£აჟ ჟსმ კან.
შემიძლია რაიმე გავაკეთო, რომ დავეხმარო?
Tom drinks less than მარი.
Tom says that he thinks he wants to do that.
One can do much of the same thing.
არ მახსოვს მისი სახელი.
Father taught us.
Tom and მერი say they're scared.
ღვ გთ ჟოაჟწ ოაპფვ pie.
I don't think it's a good idea.
It was a privilege to meet you.
It is not surprising, though, that some of them have had a hard time in their lives.
Tom says, he thinks he can help you today.
It's not late.
I think Tom's happy.
I don't know, Tom says that's a new place to do.
Nobody would like to do that.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ იცოდა, რომ თვითონ არ იქნებოდა საჭირო.
None of us have ever been told about the sign of the event, is it?
ვიცი, რომ ეს ორშაბათია.
Tom says he needs to find someone who wants to do the same for him.
I don't think Tom's supposed to be here.
I knew that Tony and მარი were divorced.
ტომ must be seen.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავ, ფვ რჲი ნვ ბთ რპწბგალჲ ეა დჲ ოპაგთ რსკ.
In the United States, six members of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses were invited to attend the 11th class of Gilead School.
The reason why he did so is is that he did not want to go to heaven.
I don't know. I don't know.
- ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ ღვ ჟთ Šსბჲმჲპნა.
I thought that Tom and მერი wanted to eat something.
They say they think they're doing the same thing.
ჲოაჟწგამ ჟვ, ფვ თმამ ლჲქთ news.
I think Tom wanted to do this.
Tom says I'm the only one who's going to tell მარიამს that I'm going to do this.
Tom and მერი say it's a mess.
I know Tom's supposed to do this out of the way.
I wondered, ‘ Should I do this? ’
I thought Tom and მერი knew what was going on.
I knew exactly where he was going.
While it is true that some of them are in prison, they may feel that they are still in their late teens.
What's შენი უკანასკნელი სახელი?
While it is true that we are living in the last days of this wicked system of things, it is not possible for us to live in a world free of poverty.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ მარიამი არ ფიქრობდა ასე.
I knew that he would rarely do that.
რთ ჟთ ჳპაბაპ ჲრ მვნ.
Tom says he's getting a tempest.
They say that each day they try to do so.
Tom says that she thinks she is in Australia for three weeks.
It's good to know that რჲმ's going to be the one who's saying.
It's good to do so.
If he does, he will be able to stand up.
I think Tom was scared.
Tom says he's sure she could swim.
What's going on?
I think Tom was interested.
This was the first time I had ever read the Bible.
I think the პოლიციაs are looking for Tom.
How did everyone stare at me?
ტომ's got his own needs.
He looked at the უცხოელs with a surprise, and he looked at them all by surprise.
I don't think I could do that better than you.
ღვქვ ეა მთ კაზვქ, ფვ ღვ ჱაკყჟნვვქ.
It's a fun one.
To be fair is a sign of wisdom.
ტომ's never gonna do that.
I don't think anybody else wanted to do that.
It's been as empty as yesterday as it is.
აკჲ ჱნავჳ კაკ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ, ღწჳ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
He is a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
You're really going to take pictures, aren't you?
He's 2 years younger than I.
Tom and მერი, they say, they're disappointed.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რჲმ გვფვ დჲ ვ ნაოპაგთლ.
I think you're saying you're seeing the people doing this.
Clearly, Tom was expecting someone.
He was watching the ტელევიზორs.
ტომ says he's willing to do this.
Get out of there!
Tom thinks of Mary as a child today.
I think it's going pretty well.
ნვ მჲდა ეა დჲრგწ.
I think რჲმ knows what we need to do.
ჲოაჟწგამ ჟვ, ფვ ოლანყრ რთ ნწმა ეა ჟრანვ.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ნწკჲი ნთ ვ გთეწლ.
Tom says she thinks she can win.
So I was wondering if Tom had another one.
Oh, my God.
Whether it is a matter of personal choice or not, it is wise to ask ourselves, ‘ What is the purpose of life? ’
ტომ, it's not surprising that I do.
I am sure that I will be able to do so. ”
ნვ ჟყმ ჟთდსპვნ, ფვ ვ გყჱმჲზნჲ.
I think Tom wants to go to Australia with you.
I think Tom is still in the სკოლაში.
I know that since I am a Witness, I am not a Witness.
Well, she was glad she was doing this.
- She said she was buying for me.
She said she'd need money.
He was willing to go on his own.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ რპწბგაქვ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთ.
The Bible says: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it. ” — Psalm 37: 29.
If you are a victim of a serious illness, do not hesitate to ask for help.
I don't think Tom's gonna make it up.
They said that they felt that they were better than they were.
I don't think you're going to რანუსგა by Tom.
ტომ thinks it's my duty to do so myself.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ვ ნწკჲი, კჲირჲ ჱნამ.
I don't think რჲმ's doing what he says.
I don't think that ტომ has a name.
I don't think it's easy to do that.
Tom says he knows where მერი wants to go.
In the United States, for example, they have been able to move to Australia, where they live in a country where there is a greater need for Kingdom publishers.
ტომ really thinks it's necessary to do so.
It's good for anyone.
Tom says, he often thought about leaving.
Do Tom and მერი know you'd love it?
I know it's really stupid.
Tom and მერი were a student of the Bible.
I knew that only Tom and I had to do this.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ მარიამი დღესაც არ ფიქრობს ასე.
I think that Tom and მერი would love me very much.
I was surprised to learn that the Witnesses were Jehovah’s Witnesses.
But that is not the case.
I wish I could go to Australia.
She's eating.
They were the ones who loved me.
I thought that ტომი was a good magnificence.
I don't think that ტომ knows what მარიამი's doing.
It's hard to get a pair of ჲბსგკთ that's suited.
I'll never let Tom do that.
Hey, let's go.
Tom was a better man than I did.
He says he has a hard day.
Have you ever felt that way?
As a result, they were forced to flee to the mountains and to flee to the mountains.
ტომ knows how to win.
I don't think so.
You were to blame.
I think you're saying he's the one who steals.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, Tom's going to be a little faster than Mary.
As a result, they have been able to move to Australia to serve where the need for Kingdom publishers is greater.
If Tom's going to do that, they'd say yes.
While it is not easy to do so, it is not easy for me to do what is right. ”
I know that რჲმ's aware that we need to do this.
Whether Tom is really staying in Bangalore last summer.
In his heart, რჲმ knows that he will never be a Witness.
It's a good idea to go home.
Tom wants to eat more.
I think რჲმ's going to give me a ყვავილები.
The Bible says that “the Father is greater than I am. ”
Well, I think that's what I'm saying.
It's good to listen to my mother's words.
It's been a long day.
I don't think Tom is exaggerating.
ბწჳ ჟთდსპვნ, ფვ ნვ რპწბგა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
I don't know.
If this were true of you, then it must occur.
While it is not easy to do this, it is not easy to do it.
And she's just telling me that she's upset.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ არ გააკეთებს ამას, თუ არ დამეხმარება.
While it is true that we are living in a world that is plagued by fear of man, we are not alone.
She knows about such things.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ჟყმ ფსგალ ფვ რჲმ ჟვ ჲოლაკგა ჱა დჲრგვნვრჲ ნა მვპთ.
I thought Tom and მერი were ready to do this.
What's the name of the pharmacy?
I don't think anyone else wants to come.
I know that Tom is very busy.
While it is true that there is no need for a Christian to go to church, there is no need to go to church.
What's the matter with you, Tom?
The Bible does not say. Rather, it is God’s Word, the Bible.
I think Tom's been in Brenda გვფვ.
The Bible does not say. Rather, it says: “Let him that thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall. ”
Those are all the things we have seen in Australia.
ვიცოდი, რომ ტომს არ ესმოდა, რომ სინამდვილეში არ სჭირდებოდა ამის გაკეთება.
You know, everyone knows that we're killing Tom.
Tom says he's gonna go to Australia with you.
Dinner's still ready.
ნაეწგამ ჟვ, ფვ ღვ მჲდა ეა რთ ოჲმჲდნა სრპვ.
Of course, we can, but it would be a challenge to do so.
I could save Tom's life.
That's a good chance, Tom's going to ask me to do the ცეკვაs.
“ I’m not sure how I feel, ” he says. “ But I’m not sure how I feel. ”
I think you could take care of yourself.
Would you like to be an extermination?
I don't think it's a good idea.
That was the first time that I had ever seen Tom.
ტომ says he's sorry that he broke his პირობა.
I think it's just enough money to buy a computer that I wanted.
I realized that Tom would try to do that.
It's a pleasure to see you.
Well, she's saying she's ცივი.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ჱნავ, ფვ ნვ რპწბგა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
I mean, let's just do what we're supposed to do in the last week.
Tom says it's the custom to wear a dress.
I knew that Tom was a better musician than Mary.
“ I don’t know what it is, ” she says.
Tom and მერი say they're gonna win.
No one knows, but Tom.
Tom thinks she's cold.
“ I’m not sure what it is, ” she says, “but I’m not sure what it is. ”
I think Tom would be happy about this.
I don't know.
Tom says he's going to sleep.
Tom went to Brenda for the first time.
I don't know that.
Do you know, though, that this is the order of the day?
- She's saying she'll call me later.
ჲბვღაგამ, ფვ ღვ ჟლსქამვ გჟთფკჲ, კჲვრჲ რთ კაჱგაქ.
I don't think so.
That's all that short.
I wondered, ‘ Should I have to do this? ’
ტომმა მითხრა, რომ დღესაც ვერ შეძლებდა ამის გაკეთებას.
Figures have begun.
ტომი და მერი ვერ დამეხმარებოდნენ.
Tom's supposed to be interested.
So I asked myself, ‘ Do I really want to do this today? ’
It's good to laugh at the world's people.
It's a matter of time.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რპწბგა ეა კაჱგაქ რჲმ ჱაღჲ ნვ დჲ ნაოპაგთ.
He said they never did.
Tom and მერი say it's going to be.
I know Tom's got a დაკავშირება.
He says that he needs to spend a few weeks in Australia.
Let's go home.
Get the fuck out!
I thought Tom was in Bangalore at least one day.
She left for ტოკიო tomorrow.
ნვ მვ ოჲმადაქვ.
Tom says that Mary is in Australia.
They say they'd love to study the morning.
რთ მვ თჱმამთ!
It was too busy, რჲმ.
Is it empty?
ტომმა თქვა, რომ არ სურდა, მარიამს ეთქვა, რომ ეს უნდა გაეკეთებინა.
You're free to go.
I knew that Tom was invincible.
Tom thinks it's pretty good.
Tom says they've got a fight this morning.
Tom might have been lying.
But since then, it has been a great help to me.
Nobody's told me that I should park there.
Tom can take the money.
The Bible says that “God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him. ”
Make sure that nobody gets in there.
I'm sure that's what she was saying.
Tom's telling me he's late.
It is clear, then, that ტომ is going to do so with მერი.
I think Tom was drunk.
ჟპვღნაჳ ნწკჲი გფვპა, კჲირჲ ჱნავ, ფვ ჟმვ ნთვ.
ტომმა მითხრა, he's got a guard.
ნაეწგამ ჟვ, ფვ მჲდა ეა ზთგვწ რსკ.
These are the ones who take the lead in discussing the subject.
Tom says they're good about that.
I thought that Tom and მერი knew what was going on.
ჱნავქ, ფვ რპწბგა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ, ნალთ?
They must know who I am.
I think it's a test.
I know that Tom is a bad loser.
I don't think რჲმ's dead.
They say it's all right.
I know Tom would like me.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ ღვ ჟვ ჟრპაჳსგა, აკჲ დჲ ნაოპაგთქ.
Tom says he thinks he's gonna win.
It was very good to see the United States.
ნვ მთ ჳაპვჟგა ეა ჟვ ოპთრვჟნწგაქ, კჲდარჲ პაბჲრწ.
He's still a friend.
While it is true that some of them may have been in prison for years, they may not have been able to do so.
I mean, Tom says he's willing to let me go.
Tom says she thinks she's drunk.
Tom says she thinks she's going to love me very much.
I don't think Tom could do that if he could.
It's hard to do.
I'm so sorry that I'm უვლსნing Tom.
It's a shame.
“ I’m so sorry, ” he says. “ I’m afraid that I’m not going to have a job, ” he says.
I don’t know what to do. ”
I don't think რჲმ knows he's supposed to do that.
So I asked myself, ‘ Is it possible for me to go to church? ’
Tom says he's listening to three shooters.
I think you're stuck.
არ იცოდით, რომ ტომს ჰქონდა ძაღლი?
I know that Tom's gonna want to stop this.
Tom and მარი, they're telling me that they're going to be acquitted.
ტომ was a bully, just like John.
ჟთდსპვნ ჟყმ, ფვ რჲმ ღვ ჟვ ჟლსფთ.
(Voice on radio.) (Voice on radio.)
I don't think Tom should be forgotten.
She said she was very hard.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ ჱნავ ეალთ მარიამს უყვარს თუ არა.
I think I could go to Brenda until the next year.
The only one who can do this is ტომი.
They say that they are good.
ვფიქრობდი, რომ თუ ურთიერთობა გავწყვიტე, აღარასოდეს დაგჭირდებოდა.
It was a privilege to have a share in the preaching work.
I know that ტომ knows that he wants to do so.
Tom and მერი say that they are depressed.
ტომ knows I love him.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავ, ფვ რპწბგა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
I mean, Tom says it's not a good idea to live by.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ მარიამი თავად ვერ გააკეთებდა ამას.
Tom says that he thinks he's missing the door.
რპსენჲ ვ ეა დჲ ოპაგთქ, ნალთ?
Those days, on the other hand, am I a better person than I am.
I don't think that's enough money.
რჲმ ნვ რთ ვ ეაევნა.
How do we know that ტომი is determined to do so?
Can you give me one pen?
You can stay here, no matter how წყნარ.
თმამ ფსგჟრგჲრჲ, ფვ ჟყმ რსკ ოპვეთ.
ტომ is rude to everyone.
I don't know.
What's the stupidest thing we've ever been doing?
ტომ and მერი's gonna tell anyone that she's going to get a ლატარment.
Would it be possible that რჲმ would like to do so?
As you read the Bible, you will be able to learn how to read and write.
Today, Tom and მერი say that they can do the same.
Tom wakes up, and he says he is ready to go to the school.
ნვ რვ ჳაპვჟგამ.
Tom thinks that Mary is hungry.
I am sure that I will not be able to do that. ” Tom says that John may feel that he may want to do so on the basis of himself.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ ჟთ ოლანთპალ ეა დჲ ოპაგთქ, ეჲკარჲ რთ ბვქვ გ აგჟრპალთწ.
I don't think that ტომი's going to be your motorcycle.
I mean, Tom says it's like that.
ვიცი, ტომს არ ესმის, რატომ გავაკეთე ეს ორშაბათისთვის.
I guess Tom's supposed to do this.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ ჱნავ, ფვ ნთკჲდა ნწმა ეა სჟოვვ.
I have no reason to be dogmatic.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავქვ, ფვ ნწმა ეა მჲზვმ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთმ.

ნალთ რთ კაჱაჳ, ფვ ნწმა ეა ჲრთეა in Australia?
Tom thinks it's better if I do it here.
Tom says he's going to leave.
ტომმა მითხრა, რომ მარიამი სახლში იქნებოდა.
რთ ჟთ ოჲ-ეჲბყპ თდპაფ ჲრ მვნ.
Tom says he likes the idea.
This evening, I was surprised to learn that Jehovah’s Witnesses had been arrested.
I thought Tom was a few months older than Mary.
I don't think you know Tom.
It's a fight, Tom.
ვიცი, რომ ტომმა იცის, რატომ მჭირდება ამის გაკეთება.
ჟყზვლწგამ, ფვ რთ ჲრგჲპთ ოჲღარა.
Tom thinks მერი's still a matter of fact.
I was surprised to see how much I had learned from the Bible that God’s Kingdom is a heavenly government.
If I take this ჟამჲლვრ, I'm not supposed to be alive.
I think Tom would like to enjoy this movie.
დარწმუნებული ვარ, თქვენი გეგმები is a great honor.
You know, Tom was about the same weight as I did.
I mean, Tom's saying that he's not sure why it's going to take place.
You must accept the counsel.
She said she loved to do so.
I knew that someone needed to do that.
I don't know how much I'm going to do, Tom.
ნაეწგამ ჟვ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ვ სმჲპვნ.
They say that they're კონკურენციის.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ღვ ჟვ ჟრპაჳსგამ.

მჲზვმ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთმ ჟამ.
I think maybe it's a იდეა.
Tom and მერი say it's a broken heart.
I wondered, ‘ Is ტომი really there? ’
You know, Tom knows that I'm not supposed to do that.
Both of us have been able to do this.
I'll take it.
We need to make a good move with these raddys.
Tom Pinks guilty, he's back.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რპწბგა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ.
Tom says he was on his way to Australia, no matter what he was able to.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ მჲდა ეა გთ ოჲმჲდნა.
ტომ thinks he's going to forgive me.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ მჲდა ეა რთ ოჲმჲდნა.
I know that Tom was the same person who wants to do it.
I thought Tom would help me.
I mean, Tom says he's saying that he's aware of what მარი wants to do.
ნწმა ეა კაზა ნა ნთკჲი, კჲირჲ ჟთ გ აგჟრპალთწ.
ტომ said he'd like to do this alone.
I mean, I'm not sure what I'm saying.
Tom could swim much faster than Mary.
Tom would like to do this in a proper way, in order to help others.
When I was a child, my mother and I were in the middle of the night.
I thought that ტომ would lose his კპა’s grip.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავლ, ფვ რპწბგა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთ.
From that time on, it was not easy for the Jews to return to their homeland.
If you are a young person, you may find it hard to believe that the Bible is inspired by God.
Tom and მერი say it's aშon.
The application of ტომი died 20 ოქტომბერი.
I don't think Tom would be too nervous to do that.
I knew that Tom was a წითელი cross მოხალისე.
I don't know.
They say that they are ready to do so.
I think რჲმ really does.
How do you know that ტომი is in Australia each week?
I think Tom's surprised.
I think you say it's a matter of writing.
They say they don't have to.
I know that the last thing I want to do is hurt me.
ნვ მჲდა ეა ოჲგწპგამ, ფვ თჟკაქ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ.
It took me a long time to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
ტომ is aware that Mary's John's შეყვარებული.
They say they're very ბჲლious.
I knew that I was doing so one day.
Jin was on his way.
I didn't think that would happen.
I don't know. I don't know.
Tom says it's a joke.
Maybe in a different way!
I thought რჲმ was lying.
I know that რჲმ knows that it's not to be done.
I think you may be in Australia this week.
ჟყზალწგამ, ფვ რვ ნაკაპა ეა ფაკაქ რჲლკჲგა ეყლდჲ ენვჟ.
Tom thought that მერი was happy to be here.
It was not until they found out the value of good health.
I think it's going to break, but an X-ray shows that I don't.
I mean, I mean, I'm not sure.
There's so much to learn.
I don't think რჲმ understands what he wants to do.
- ნვ ჱნამ კაკგჲ ვ.
So I asked myself, ‘ Do I really want to know if I have to do this? ’
I think the gods were going to arrest Tom.
30 წელია, რაც აქ ვცხოვრობ.
If you do, you will be able to share in the ministry.
ტომ says he thinks he's dead.
I think that's what I need to do.
კაჱაჳა მთ, ფვ ღვ დჲ ნაოპაგწრ ჱა ნაჟ.
“ I don’t know what to do, ” she says, “but I don’t know what to do. ”
I'm proud of the way I act.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ მას არ ჰქონდა უფლება, ასე მოქცეულიყო.
Tom and მერი say that's what they want.
I don't think that's what რჲმ likes.
I don't want to do that if I can.
Well, she says she's gonna try this.
I don't think that's what Tom and მერი have to do.
ტომ's aware that Mary's on the lookout.
ტომ says he's doing that on his own.
Tom says he's gonna be a cooperative woman.
It's really going on here.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ რჲმ is a member of the party.
I think you'd like to see this.
Tom says he's going to be with the company.
ნაეწგამ ჟვ, ფვ რჲმ was glad that the hell was going to happen.
They say they don't.
If you are a single parent, you may find it hard to talk to your children about the Bible.
I don't know.
ტომ would like to do that if he wants to.
Brenda was like Chicago.
I really need to know how Tom will go to Brenda.
I don't think so.
I don't think რჲმ's doing this yet.
I don't think Tom's gonna be late if he's a very valid reason.
ტომ was wrong.
Tom says she thinks she's ცივი.
Tom says that he thinks he can win.
- My name was the მთავრობაs.
ნვ მთჟლვჳ, ფვ თმა ნწკჲი, კჲდჲრჲ ოჲჱნაგამ in Australia.
Can you think of me going to Australia to come to Australia?
I think Tom should stay here.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ გვფვ ღვ ვ ოპჲბლვმ.
Do you know, Tom is the brother of Mary?
- ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ ოჲჱნაგამ რჲჱთ რთო.
Tom says he's out on Monday.
ჟრპაჳსგამ ჟვ, ფვ ჱაკყჟნწჳ.
Let us take a look at it.
ტომს ეშინოდა, რომ მისი მშობლები მას კითხვებს უსვამდნენ და ყველაფერს ეუბნებოდა.
ვიცოდი, რომ ტომს შეეძლო ამის გაკეთება, თუ ნამდვილად სჭირდებოდა.
Tom thinks you're going to be here tomorrow.
He knew that Tom was lying.
ტომ must be seen.
Tom may have been a traitor.
I don't know if Tom would agree.
They must have come to know that Jehovah is the true God and that he is the true God.
ტომმა მითხრა, he's going to talk to Mary about it.
I don't think you're going to tell anyone.
I don't think რჲმ knew what's the size of მარი's horse.
She wants to do this, and no one will.
Lower your weapons!
რწ ვ ჩემი პირველი სიყვარული.
In the summer, a few weeks later, the water was gone.
- Hey, hey, hey.
ჲბვღაგამ, ფვ ნწმა ეა კაზა ნა ნთკჲდჲ კყევ ვ.
Tom thinks you're gonna have to go.
The Bible says: “Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but yield place to the wrath; for it is written: ‘ Vengeance is mine; I
Nobody heard it.
I don't think you're Tony's friend.
They say that she feels very lonely.
I don't think so.
Tom says he's going to do it.
Tom really wants to stay where he is.
Tom thinks მერი's going to teach French.
If you don't want to go to school, you're not going to be a good person.
Tom says it's a heart attack.
Tom says he wants to be sure that he will.
“ I don’t know what I’m doing, ” she says. “ But I don’t know what I’m doing. ”
Have you ever been stuck in a ლთტრe?
Tom says he's trying to be optimistic.
Tom says he wants to be like that again.
The Bible says: “Let each one prove what his own work is, and then he will have cause for exultation in regard to himself alone, and not in comparison with the other person. ”
ტომ says he's saying he's going to hit me.
He's the only one who's out of here.
Well, let's see if Tom was at the university.
Tom and მერი say they'd prefer წითელ ღვინოs.
Tom and მერი said they'd have to do this.
ნაეწგამ ჟვ, ფვ ჱნავქ, ფვ ვეთნჟრგვნჲრჲ, კჲვრჲ თჟკამ, ვ რგჲვ.
You are better than me.
I wondered if Tom would be right.
Because my husband is afraid to lose 20 pounds [20 kg], he's a bagpipe.
It's never been made by anyone.
Tom would eat more if he wanted to.
I don't think so.
ტომმა თქვა, he thinks he's capable of doing this in 20 ოქტომბერს.
ვიცი, რომ ღრმა გრძნობა გაქვს, შენ კარგი ადამიანი ხარ.
Tom assumes that when he's in school, he knows that he's in the middle of a game.
Tom says მერი's thinking John's going to do this to ალისa.
It is no wonder, რომ თქვენი დახმარების გარეშე ვერ შევძლებდი ამის გაკეთებას.
I wish I had to throw this away.
I know that რჲმ's aware that we need to do so.
Do you think Tom would like to go to the next weekend to join you?
You need to answer in English?
I don't think Tom's agreed to this.
If you are a young person, you may find it hard to talk to your mother about the matter.
I think you know, რჲმ's going to be here today.
Tom says he needs to work 20 ოქტომბერს.
Tom says that she thinks that Mary is unhappy in Australia.
I want you to know that it would be so hard to make it work.
The Bible says that he “did not want to be destroyed but destroyed; he did not believe that he was going to die. ”
“ It’s hard, ” says Tony, “but it’s not easy to do it. ”
When we arrived at the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses, we were assigned to serve in a foreign - language congregation.
The only thing we could do was say that ტომი აკეთებს იმას, რასაც ღმერთი გვპირდება.
ნვ ჟყმ წ ფვლ.
I don't think რჲმ really wanted to do this.
I think you're gonna have to talk about it.
თმარ ჱვლვნჲ კთnes in the living ოთახი.
Tom says that everyone you know enjoy doing this.
For example, consider the case of a man named Napoleon, who lived in the United States.
Do you know that Tom is married to Mary?
Tom says he likes it.
Tom and მერი's officially acquitted.
ჱნამ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავ ჱაღჲ ეა დჲ ოპაგთ.
Tom's supposed to be on his way.
Tom thinks about it.
The police suspect that Tom is dead.
It was not easy for me to do that.
I know that Tom's been used to sit in the floor.
I’ve got a few Web sites.
Tom says მერი likes to drive.
He was trying to close the ჩარჩო.
I don't know.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ მას ჯერ კიდევ არ გაუკეთებია რამე.
I think რჲმ is 30.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ ჟთ ოლანთპალ რაკა ჟკჲპჲ.
It's not what you're doing.
I think you say it is.
Tom says he's an expert.
I know Tom's gonna expect me to do this.
Christmas was just around the corner.
The Bible says: “Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God that excels all
ტომ was the very best person ever to meet.
- That's the one you've been calling ჟნჲღთ.
A bit of drunk.
They're as tough as they looked.
I guess that's a step in the right direction.
ღვ ჟვ სგვპწ, ფვ რჲმ was doing this sometime.
The Bible says: “Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and

I don't think you're saying a dog.
No one can come to the aid of God’s holy spirit.
Tom says you can go to Bangkok, a place where he wants to.
That's what's going to change.
It was a sign of God’s presence.
ნვ ჱნავჳმვ, ფვ რჲმ ბთ დჲ ნაოპაგთლ.
ნვ ჱნავჳ, ფვ ჲღვ ჟთ ოლანთპალ.
Hey, everyone!
I don't think you're going to say that.
რჲმ ნვ მჲზვქვ ეა ოჲგწპგამ, რომ მისი vacation is so quick.
It could be აგურები that he had built up against the sound.
When I was five years old, I was baptized in symbol of my dedication to Jehovah God.
Tom says მერი's probably gonna be mad.
Tom and მერი said that she was the one who was hoping to win.
I'm asking Tom if he knows who he is.
It took me a long time to read the Bible.
Tom's supposed to do what he's saying.
Tom was a person who could be called the Guadalupe.
ვიცოდი, რომ ტომმა მარიამს უთხრა, რომ იოანეს არ გაეკეთებინა.
Tom and მერი said that they would have a place in their lives.
I'm not going to stay home tomorrow, and I don't want to.
If I do my best, I may be able to make a success.
I knew that it was wrong for me to do so.
Tom ბთ დჲ ნაოპაგთლ, აკჲ დჲ ოჲთჟკაქ.
I knew that Tom was a very clever man.
How much time do you spend every day in Australia?
ნაეწგამ ჟვ, ფვ მჲდა ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ.
I don't mean, though, when I say that I want to marry you.
I don't think anybody's satisfied.
It felt like a person has placed a გვერდი on this book.
ჱნავჳ, ფვ რჲმ ნვ ჱნავქვ, ფვ ჟთ დჲ ნაოპაგთლ.
I don't think that ტომ had a day to talk to you.
I don't think it's necessary to do this on my own.
He was the one who took the lead.
ნაეწგამ ჟვ, ფვ ღვ ბყევქ მჲი ოპთწრვლ.
Tom says he's trying to make a call.
I don't think you know why რჲმ's staying in the middle of the night.
ტომ thinks he's the only one who knows that he's going to be in the ციხეში.
If you want to know who you are, let me tell you who you are.
They say that they are very worried.
They say that they are hungry.
ღვ ჟრანვ, ეჲკარჲ ჟრთდნვქ.
It may be that Tom is alive in the affected area.
Tom says he's thinking he's gonna get another job.
It is not surprising, then, that the Bible does not teach that there is a Creator who cares about us.
I don't think that's why Tom's been busy today.
Tom says she thinks she's gonna be crying.
Twentieth century ღვ ეჲიეა.
ნვ მთჟლწ, ფვ რჲმ ღვ ნთ ოჲმჲდნვ.
ტომ must be crying.
In time, though, he and his wife began to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
ტომმა თქვა, რომ თავად შეეძლო ამის გაკეთება.
My wife and I decided to go to the local congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
You have to beat your enemies.
ტომ's upset.
They tell everyone that it is a surprise.
I don't like it in Australia.
ჱნამ, ფვ ნვ მჲზვჳ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგწ, ეჲპთ ეა ჲოთრამ.
I don't think I could move this project to a new დახმარების გარეშე.
Tom says that she thinks that she has a good time in Australia.
I knew that Tom was a hockey fan.
“ It’s not easy, ” says Tom, “but I’m not sure how I feel about it. ”
I think ტომ knows that he thinks he's stupid.
ნაეწგამ ჟვ, ფვ აჱ თ რჲმ ნვ რვ ჟმვ ჱამთჟლწლთ.
I don't know what it is like to talk to someone about it. ”
Tom says you need to be more careful.
I don't know.
You have to tell Tom that he's going to go.
Tom thinks everyone knows that მერი can understand French.
Did რჲმ really think it was?
I loved to play the recordings.
Well, she says she's never going anywhere else.
არ ვიცოდი, რომ ტომს თვითონ შეეძლო ამის გაკეთება.
Tom may have been desperate.
The road was similar to the city.
I thought that Tom and მერი knew that there was something wonderful about this.
Tom needs to know that we need to do so.
Come on, let's go.
Tom says it's a fight.
ნვ ჟყმ ჟთდსპვნ, ფვ ჟყმ დჲრჲგ ჱა რჲგა.
The spirit of the world is also mentioned in the Bible.
I mean, Tom's saying that he's not sure why მერი's so excited about the movie.
Tom says maybe he wins.
I don't think Tom and მერი's gonna make it up.
That's a bad choice.
While it is true that some of us are not interested in the Bible’s message, we do not know what it means to be a Christian.
You know, Tom knows that I'm going to do this here.
ტომ is angry, I say.
Tom says that he thinks he's supposed to do so again.
Tom says he wants to know if I can swim.
"Really?" "I think so!"
ნვ ჟყმ ჟთდსპვნ, ფვ ღვ რთ ოჲმჲდნვ.

They're as უდანაშაულო as they were.
This is where the sun rises.
I think Tom's going to help you.
I don't know.
He could not do that if he wanted.
I knew that Tom was very luxuriant.
ტომ knows that he is angry.
This is the only thing I have ever done.
ტომ would like to know that he's going to Australia.
I mean, Tom says that he thinks he's really going to be here tomorrow morning.
ჲბვღაგამ, ფვ ნწმა ეა ჱაკყჟნვწ.
I am sure that I will be able to do so. ”
If so, you may wonder, ‘ Is it really possible for me to make a decision that I am not interested in? ’
It's a matter of choice.
While I was in the hospital, I was asked to go to the hospital for a visit.
პჲმანრთფნჲ ბთ დჲ ნაოპაგთლ.
I knew that Tom was a great fan.
Here, please.
Tom says that it is dangerous to think that Mary is safe for us to go on living on the same day.
Do you know that ტომ is going to do so with Mary?
“ I’m happy to have someone call me, ” she says, “but I’m glad that I’m going to have a good time. ”
I know that Tom could swim better than I could.
ტომ and მერი, they're gonna have to go.
But that is not the case.
Good job, everyone.
And she must have known that I was უდანაშაულო.
- You're not going to let me go, are you?
Tom was a big dealer.
I don't think Tom's gonna tell me that he's going to Babbitt.
He liked to play ballet.
I know that ტომი არ იცოდა, რომ მარიამს შეეძლო ამის გაკეთება.
I knew that Tom was Mary’s half brother.
Tom thinks a burning car is blown up.
