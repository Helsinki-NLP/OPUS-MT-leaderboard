It’s a surprise that Tom would be able to talk to me about the matter.
My wife and I decided to go to the local congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Whether a husband or a wife has a husband or a wife, the wife should be careful not to allow the matter to cause him to fall into sin.
I think it's okay, Tom.

I think it's Tom who wants to please me.

I think Tom would like to do the same.
I think that ტომ should be a good chance to do so.
My wife and I were able to share in the preaching work.
I don't think so.
ეჭვი მაქვს, რომ არსებობს ვინმე, ვინც მე მომყვება.
It was not easy for me to do that.
That is why I was so impressed with the Bible’s message that I was able to read it.
It was not easy for me to talk to him about it.
It was not easy for me to do what was right.
In fact, this year, Tom would come to Bangalore.
From the beginning of the 20th century, millions of people from all walks of life have come to realize that the Bible is God’s Word
It was not easy for me to do that.
I think რჲმ's going to come around.
It is not easy for me to do what is right. ”
It was a very serious mistake to think that ტომი was the purpose of this.
It was a mistake to think that Tom would be humiliated.
It was a mistake to think that Tom would be pleased with this.
It was a mistake to think that Tom would be here.
It was a mistake to think that Tom would be angry.
It was a mistake to think that Tom would be insurmountable.
It was a mistake to think that Tom would be nervous.
It was a mistake to think that Tom was going to be in the wrong place in the world.
It was very serious that რჲმ would think that it was a good idea to do so.
It was not easy for me to do what was right. ”
From this point on, we have learned that the Bible is the best source of information available in the world.
My wife and I decided to go to the local Kingdom Hall to visit the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Mexico.
From time to time, it has been said that it is “the last days ” of the present system of things.
My wife and I decided to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
I'd rather not do this alone.
I don't want to go.

As a matter of fact, he was crying for help.
If only you could make a decision, then you would not be able to go to another country tomorrow night.
If anyone can, he can.
If anyone has a question, please read the answers to his questions.
Well, it's just my fear that there's a couple of conjunctions.
Although it was not easy for me to make a living, it was not easy for me to make a living.
I’m not sure what I’m going to do.
It made me happy to be able to help others learn about Jehovah and his purposes.
I don't think we can make a better choice.
I felt that Tom would be crying.
I felt very tumult.
If I can say that Tom does not, I want to shoot him.
If English can be spoken better, I could get that job.
თუ მეტი დრო დამჭირდებოდა, მე მოგვწერდი.
If I speak of Tom's მისამართი, I'm writing to him.
If I did, I would have to make it myself.
If I take this ჟამჲლვრ, I'm not supposed to be alive.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I think it must be good.
I don't think everyone's busy.
I don't think Tom's messing up again.
I don't think Tom's gonna know the answer.
I don't think Tom's worried.
I don't think so.
I don't think you know why რჲმ's staying in the middle of the night.
I don't think that my voice will change.
If I do my best, I may be able to make a success.
If I’m familiar with the Bible, I’m not sure what it says.

If that's the case, we'll do it.
If მზისთვის არ იქნებოდა, then ყველანი მოვკვდებოდით.
If it's possible, there's no way anyone can do it.

If so, each day we are going to have a home.
If it is, there's no food for me to eat.
If we are to be God’s people, it would be a privilege to have a share in this work.

So I think that ტომი is still a აგურის director.
I think you'd like to be a რანუსგაr.
I think you're going to თამაში.
I think you're a better chess player than this.

I think you're right.
I think you're rude.
I think there's someone else.
I think you are still in Australia.
I think you should be in Australia this week.
I think you're supposed to be doing this right now.
I think it's French.
I don't think it's Tom.
I don't think you're Tony's friend.
I don't think so.
I don't think you're going to be married to Tom.
I think you'd like baboon.
I don't think it's a good idea, but I don't like it.
I think you'll notice that Tom is here.
It was a great responsibility.
He was a dungeon სახლი.
It was empty for America to lose the lives of the ახალგაზრდა men and women.
It was a cat.
It was a delightful place in the city of New York.
It is a pity to have been able to travel with you.
Sad to say, it's okay to be with you.
It was a privilege to meet you.
It is good to take time to make it a habit to make it a habit to make it a habit to make it a habit.
Clearly, he was სახლში.
It was Friday.
It's getting big.
He's out of the darkness.
He came out of the sea.
It is good to be so hard to study.
It was wonderful.
Never before has it been too late.
It is not always easy to do good to others.
It was a temple, a temple, and a temple.
It is hard to speak English.
It was especially hot today.
It would be წვიმის.
It was not until they found out the value of good health.
It was not until it came to be acknowledged that the value of it was lost.
It's a browser. It's an exaggeration event.
It's always been hard to face reality.
It's not like it's been so difficult to hear.
Those who have been writing this letter would have been well - known.
It's hard, but we're going to do it.
It's hard to say to anyone.
You know, it's hard to get to know each other.
- ნვ ვ ეალვფ ჲრ ჳჲრვლ.
It's a საწყისი.
It's gonna hurt.
It's good to laugh at the world's people.
It's heavy.
That's not just my own fault.
If that's the case, then it would be that Tom should ever admit that he was wrong.
It's like რჲმ's going anywhere.
It's a lot of fun.
ნვ ვ ნსზნჲ ეა დჲ ოპაგწ.
ტომ's got to be doing this myself.
არ არის საჭირო ამ ლექციაზე დასწრება.
There was no need to make a decision.
ნვ ვ ნსზნჲ ეა ჟთ რსკ ოჲგვფვ.
შეუძლებელია წარსულის შეცვლა.
არ არის მართებული, რომ დააგვიანდეს სადილად.
That's right.
That's really important.
It's a wind line that's on the line.
That's what I could never miss.
It's Tom's mind, it's mine.
It is likely that Tom would like to do so.
That's it.
It's still going to be.
It was worth repairing this კამერ.
It's worth it to go there.
It is said that he knows the secret.
He still moved.
It was late.
It is not surprising, then, that in the Americas, there are two different სახლიs.
It was not until the time was over.
He was not too late.
It is not too late for you.
In fact, it was not easy for me to be a teacher.
In fact, the earth is divided.
It was very nice to show you the way.
It was very practical.
It would be difficult to understand the cause.
ღვ ჟრანვ, ეჲკარჲ ჟრთდნვქ.
It would have been hard for Tom to do that.
It's hard for Tom to win.
It's gonna be impossible.
It's gonna take a lot less than one hour to go.
It seemed like she was going to წვიმის.
It seemed that Tom and მერი wanted to do so.
It felt like a person has placed a გვერდი on this book.
It seemed that რჲმ was missing someone.
It made sense.
Maybe it's so hard to do as you think.
You might want to do so.
It may be as hard as you think it would be to do.
It may be difficult to do so.
It must be a shock.
It must be broken in the race for life.
It is not easy to do so.
It must be expensive.
I am a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

It is three days სწორად.
I'm trying to convince myself that Tom is going to do it, but I'm saying that he's interested in me.
We're just trying to make our way out of Tom.
I'm trying to kill twice.
I'm trying to beat Tom up to make him come to Australia, but I'm saying, there's another thing we need to do.
It's just to me that you're gonna have to tell me what you're doing.
It's 2:30.
That's a deal.
It's a beautiful day!
-It's been a long time!
It's a total tragedy.
It's a deadly poison!
That's good.
That's good, Tom's leaving the door open.
გჟთფკჲ ღვ ვ ნაპვე.
It's always a დაბადების დღე.
It's a miracle!
It was a miracle that ჩვენი სახლი survived the მიწისძვრა.
It's a miracle that რჲმ's still alive.
It's a miracle, რჲმ's still alive in that accident.
ზალკჲ, ფვ ნვ ჟმვ ოჲჟვრთლთ რჲმ, კჲდარჲ თმაჳმვ გყჱმჲზნჲჟრ.
It's a საიდუმლო, so be sure to tell anyone.
- ჟპამნჲ ვ, ფვ ნვ მჲზვქ ეა ეჲიევქ ჟ ნაჟ.
It was very difficult for me to walk far.
It's been a year since we met.
მთნა ეჲჟრა გპვმვ, ჲრკაკრჲ რთ კაჱაჳ, ფვ რვ ჲბთფამ.
It's decided.
It's up to us today.
It's beyond me.
It was difficult to love someone, and it was impossible for him to know if he or she had been the same person.
It was difficult to love someone, and it was impossible for him to know if he or she had been the same person.

It was difficult to love someone, and it was impossible for him to know if he or she had been the same person.
ისე ჩანდა, რომ სოფელში არავინ იყო.
It seemed that Tom and მარი were doing this together.
It seemed that რჲმ was the best.
It seems she needs to work hard.
It seemed that Tom and მარი were a celebrity musician.
It seems that რჲმ wanted to be a teacher.
Looks like you've had a good time here.
Looks like there's არავინ there.
Looks like there's არავინ.
მთჟლწ, ფვ ჟყმ გთზეალ რჲჱთ ფჲგვკ, კჲირჲ ნჲჟთ ფაქა ოჲ-პანჲ.
That's enough to make you mad!
It's not gonna be easy to do.
It would have been difficult to get someone to change Tom.
ლვჟნჲ ღვ ვ ეა ნამვპთქ ნწკჲი, ჱა ეა ნავმა რაჱთ კყღა.
It would have been hard to do so.
It would have been hard to get someone to change Tom.
ეჲბპჲ რჲმ ჲღვ ნვ დჲ ვ ნაოპაგთლ.
It was difficult to say that Tom was only 13 years old.
It was difficult to catch a scam with a smuggler.
რპსენჲ ვ ეა დჲ ოპაგთქ, ნალთ?
It's hot.
It's not easy to make it.
It's important to do that.
It must have happened.
It's just a twenty.
It was amazing.
It smells like a creek in the area.
It's more than it is.
It was almost the same!
It's a bad plan.
It's a big deal.
It's about them.
It's a cat.
It's a კომპიუტერი ოპჲბლვმ.
That's a very difficult question.
It's good to ask a woman how old she is.
It's a good idea to recognise პაროლი.
That's all that short.
It's always hard to tell the difference between right and wrong.
გთნადთ ნვ ვ გყჱმჲზნჲ ეა წევქ ეჲბპვ, კჲდარჲ ოყრსგაქ ნა რჲჱთ ჟგწრ.
It's a hard solution.
It's a prerequisite.
It's as bad as it sounds.
It's not like a ცივი here as it pleases.
It's been such a ცივი that yesterday is.
It's as crazy as it was.
It's as dangerous as you think.
It's a საიდუმლო.
It's a serious error.
It's like a hot here, as it ჲფაკგაs.
It's been as empty as yesterday as it is.
It's a თდპა.
It's still late.
ნვ ვ წჟნჲ კყევ ღვ დჲ ნაოპაგთმ.
That's who's in front of the attack.
It's a duty.
That's enough.
It's still done.
It's hard to go to Tom.
It's hard for you, isn't it?
It's hard to be understood by everyone.
It was hard to find work today.
It was not enough to know only one language.
It's still an hour.
That's not fair.
That's right.
It's still a matter of time.
It's gonna be as hard as you think it would be.
ნწმა ეა ვ ლვჟნჲ ეა დჲ ნაოპაგთქ.
ნწმა ეა ვ ლვჟნჲ ეა ნამვპწ ნწკჲი, ჱა ეა ნავმა რაჱთ კყღა.
It's going to be fine.
It's not gonna happen.
It's going to work.
It's good for anyone.
It's hard to recognize what's going on.
It's good to eat and run.
It's a good thing to stop food.
That's how much you know, but what you can do in that way.
That's just a little bit of a problem.
It's just რჲმ's wrong.
It's just რჲმ's პრობლემა.
It's like I did.
It's like this is happening.
It's like trying to avoid Tom.
It's probably not possible that Tom will ever admit that he's wrong.
It's probably not possible that Tom will ever admit that he's wrong.
ალბათ, ისე ადვილი არ იქნება, როგორც თქვენ გგონიათ.
It's probably the წვიმის tomorrow.
It's like we've been doing things.
It's like you're gonna get married.
It's like there's another thing we need to do.
It's like you know what to do.
ნვ ვ მჲ£ა პაბჲრა.
You know, it's good to get hit.
It's okay to smoke here.
It's out of action.
It's out of the question until the douche lady sang.
It's impossible.
It's done.
It’s really safe to drink from the world to the rest of the world.
That's reasonable.
It's a multicolored science.
It's safe to drink this გჲეა.
It's safe to walk out of the darkness.
If you drive, it would be safe to do it.
It's safe.
It's თოვლი.
It's all there is to do.
That's gonna be a shame.
That's something very good.
That's something I think I could do.
That's something I think I could do.
That's something I want to talk to you.
That's something I want to talk to you.
That's what I could make a quick decision.
That's something that I'm proud of.
ნვ ვ ნვღჲ, კჲვრჲ ჟყმ მნჲდჲ ეჲბყპ.
That's something I think I could do.
It's not to be fun.
It's not that დიდხანს ფრენის.
ნვ ვ რჲლკჲგა ჟრპანნჲ, isn't it?
It's a უკანასკნელი goal, but it's a process of getting it done.
It's Tom who needs protection.
It's too expensive.
It's not too hard.
It's not too late to call Tom.
It's not too late to change the schedule.
It's not too late for a დაბრუნება.
It's up to that რჲმ's dying in the hospital.
It's not a precaution.
It's probably a thing you've never had to წვიმა tomorrow.
It's not that fun today.
That's what he looked like.
ნვ ვ რჲგა, კჲვრჲ კაჱგაქ, ნჲ კაკ დჲ კაჱგაქ.
It was worth mentioning.
That's a big deal.
It's worth the effort.
It's okay.
It's you, it's me!
Clearly, Tom and მერი were expecting someone.
ჲფვგთენჲ რჲმ ნვ მჲზვ ეა დჲ ოპაგთ ბვჱ ოჲმჲღ.
Clearly, Tom was angry.
Obviously, Tom's been used to work on a solid scale.
Clearly, Tom was expecting someone.
Obviously, Tom wanted to do this.
It's good to be weird.
არაფერია ცუდი იმაში, თუ ვინმე გატკენს გულს.
It's up to you to keep going.
It was as if a person were crying.
That's impossible.
It must be, then, that რჲმ comes here, როცა ის პატარა იყო.
It's impossible that ტომი's coming here, როცა ის პატარა იყო.
ალბათ, რჲმ may have known that I am here.
It must have been hard for Tom to win.
It's probably Tom's coming.
It was a flood of cats and ძაღლs.
It was წვიმის, beautiful forty-five weeks.
- ჲგჲ £ვ ჟრგაპნჲ დჲპვ!
It's really important.
It's really important.
It's been said that ტომი and მერი are on their way.
It's amazing that you've heard anything about Tom.
It's amazing, though, that თქვენ არაფერი გსმენიათ იმაზე, თუ რა მოხდება.
That's what Tom wants.
It was დროა, reconsidering the წარსული.
გპვმვ ვ ეა ჟვ თჱმთვქ, რჲმ.
That's how Tom მერი wanted to see.
That's how Tom მერი wanted to talk.
რჲმ's Turbulence Day tomorrow.
ზალკჲ, ფვ ნვ ჟთ მთ ოპვფთლ ჟყგვრა.
He's just out of sight.
It is sad that this is happening.
It's probably Tom's going to do that.
It's probably Tom's going to do that.
That's it.
It was usually difficult to understand what შვედs said.
It's very ქარის, but it's cold.
It has been observed, on the contrary, on the inside, on the inside, on the inside, and on the inside.
That's what Tom wants.
გთნარა ვ რგჲწ, ა აჱ ჟყმ ჲრგპართრვლვნ.
It takes about half a week to get married.
I am able to quit my computer.
Only by the end of the 20th century did Jehovah’s Witnesses continue to show their love for one another.
I'm discarding the computer.
It is clear to all of this, however, that it is a ტერორისტული თავდასხმა.
ნათელი იყო, რომ ტომს არ ესმოდა, რომ ნამდვილად არ სჭირდებოდა ამის გაკეთება.
ნათელი იყო, რომ ტომს არ ესმოდა, რომ სინამდვილეში არ სჭირდებოდა ამის გაკეთება.
ნათელი იყო, რომ ტომს არ ესმოდა, რომ თქვენ ასეც მოიქეცით.
It is clear that he is determined to do so yesterday.
ნათელი იყო, რომ ტომი ჯერ არ შესრულებულა.
ნათელი იყო, რომ ტომი ჯერ კიდევ არ მოსულა იმისათვის, რომ ასე მოქცეულიყო.
It is clear, then, that რჲმ loves to do so.
It is clear that he is capable of doing so.
It is clear that he is determined to do so.
It is clear, then, that ტომი is not a duty to do so.
It is clear, then, that ტომი is not to be taken lightly.
It is clear, then, that ტომ is going to do so with მერი.
It is good to know that ტომი must be a good example for us.
ნათელი იყო, რომ ტომი იყო ის, ვისაც მარიამისთვის უნდა ეთქვა, რომ არ სჭირდებოდა ამის გაკეთება.
It is clear, then, that ტომი იყო ის, ვისაც მარიამისთვის უნდა ეთქვა ამის გაკეთება.
It is clear that ტომი იყო ის, ვინც მარიამს უნდა ეთქვა ამის გაკეთება.
It's good to know that რჲმ's going to need to do so.
It’s hard to do that, but it’s not easy to say.
It is hard to admit, though, that he needs the help of his wife.
It's just a joke.
It is not easy to make a decision.
It's a pleasure.
It's not who's in front of the attack.
It's hard to get a pair of ჲბსგკთ that's suited.
You know, it's obvious that რჲმ's going to do it.
It's obvious that Tom would like to sing.
It is obvious that ტომი is upset.
It is a day in which I am no longer able to sleep. ”
In fact, it has been the world’s most popular tourist attraction.
Those who are involved in this attack are those who are involved in it.
It was a hot day.
It may be that you have to learn to control your temper.
It would not be a good thing for you to do.
It's not that way.
It's going to stay that way.
It’s the only thing that's ever done.
It's probably better to go to the people than to charlatan, if they're beaten with a sword, they're called a laser.
It took 20 minutes to get to ტაქსი.

It would be fun to do this.
It's hard to do.
It's good to do so.

It's not the hardest thing to do.
It would be wise to do so.
It would be wrong to do so.
Oh, my God.
It is not easy to think about what you are doing.
I was able to do everything I could to help others.

I want to go to Mass in the hospital.
I want to hear a story.
I would like to know if Tom and მერი would eat meat, or I would like to know.

Well, I'm surprised that Tom's going to do what everyone else wants to do.
It's a surprise that Tom would like to do what I want to do.
It's a surprise, Tom's coming yesterday.
It's a surprise, ტომ's gonna have to do what everyone else has to do.
It's a surprise, ტომ's gonna want to do what he wants me to do.
It’s amazing, then, that I’m not sure how much I’m going to do. ”
გამიკვირდა, როდესაც ტომმა მითხრა, რომ არ სურდა ამის გაკეთება.
It’s amazing, then, that Tom does not want to do anything that he wants to do.
I'm the only one who knows that Tom would like to do this.
I am the only person who knows that ტომ wants to do so.

A few days later, I received an invitation to attend the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead in South Lansing, New York.
He said: “I would like to thank you very much for the article, but I would like to thank you for the article.
Later, Tom was invited to join me in the ministry.
I wish everyone knew this.

It's seven o'clock.
While I was in the hospital, my wife and I were able to attend the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the United States.
While I was in the hospital, I was surprised to learn that Tom is not the only person who wants to know about God.
I was wondering if it would be წვიმის.
Well, I was wondering if it was safe here to go.
So I was wondering if there's a chance that Tom should be here tomorrow.
It was thought, ‘ Could Tom possibly have a chance to help? ’
While I was in the hospital, I was asked to go to the hospital for a visit.
I wondered, ‘ Does this really work? ’
It was thought, ‘ If Tom and მერი were going to say anything about what is happening, how would they react? ’
So I asked myself, ‘ Is it possible for me to be married? ’
I wondered if Tom and მერი really were interested.

I wondered if Tom and მერი were still safe.
So I asked if Tom and მერი still stared at me.
I wondered if Tom and მერი still had a good time.
I wondered if Tom and მერი were worried.
So I asked myself, ‘ What is the cause of this problem? ’
So I asked myself, ‘ Can I be here yesterday? ’
So I thought that Tom and მერი should be doing the right thing.
So I asked if Tom could swim.
So I was wondering if Tom had another one.
Well, I was wondering if Tom ოდესმე asks მერი why they're doing this.
It was just a matter of concern to me that Tom asked me why he is killing him.
It was thought, ‘ If Tom ოდესმე is in Bangalore, then it would be a great deal of trouble. ’
It was thought, though, that if ტომი ოდესმე tell us what we are doing in that day, we will be able to say no.
I was wondering if Tom's asleep.
I wondered if Tom was excited.
I was wondering if Tom was scared.
So I asked if Tom would go to Bangalore next week.
I was surprised to learn that Tom was happy.
I was wondering if Tom was a hero.
It was thought, ‘ If he is rich, he will have to be rich. ’
I wondered if Tom was satisfied.
Well, it's a matter of concern to me, Mr. Jensen.
Well, I was wondering if Tom knows the weight.
Well, I was wondering if Tom knows Mary's going to do that.
I wondered if Tom knew that she wanted to do so.
So I asked if Tom would like to ცეკვა as much as she did to me as she did.
So I asked him if he wanted to do so.
Well, it was just a matter of concern to me, sir.
It was thought, ‘ If Tom still remembers the way he did, how can he do so? ’
I was surprised to see how much I had learned from the Bible that God’s Kingdom is a heavenly government.
I was surprised to see how much I had learned from the Bible that God’s Kingdom is a heavenly government in the hands of Jesus Christ.
So I asked if Tom would be late tomorrow.
I wondered if Tom would be right.
Well, I was thinking about how Tom can change his mind.
It was a pleasure to know how much ტომ has been able to do with the money he has paid.
I was wondering what ტომ was going to do.
So I asked myself, ‘ Could I be able to do that again? ’
I was surprised to learn that the Witnesses were Jehovah’s Witnesses.
So I asked him if he could help me.
So I asked myself, ‘ Can I still do that? ’
I wondered, ‘ Can I really do this? ’
So I asked myself, ‘ Do I really need to do the same? ’
I wondered, ‘ Could I really need this? ’
I wondered, ‘ Should I do this? ’
I wondered, ‘ Should I do this? ’
ვფიქრობ, იქნება ხვალ ნამდვილად ცხელი.
I was wondering if she was going to თოვლი tomorrow.
Well, I was wondering if Tom would know if he could.
I was wondering if Tom knew the phone number of მარი.
So I asked myself, ‘ Do I really want to be part of the world? ’
I was surprised to learn that the Bible is God’s inspired Word, the Bible.
I wondered, არსებობს თუ არა ტომი?
I wondered, არსებობს თუ არა ტომი?
I was wondering if there's a cliché left in the მაცივარ.
I was surprised to learn that the Witnesses were not interested in the Bible.
While I was still in the hospital, I was deeply moved by the Bible’s promise of a paradise earth.
So I asked myself, ‘ Is it possible for me to go to church? ’
I wondered, ‘ Will ტომი and მერი return? ’
It was just a matter of concern to me.
Whether Tom buys this სახლი in Park Street is watching the last week.
So I was wondering if Tom could help him this night.
I wondered if Tom could do that.
I wondered if Tom could help.
I wondered if Tom can help.
I was surprised to see how much ტომ can make it possible for me to make a decision.
So I asked him if he would like me to come to the Kingdom Hall.
Well, I was wondering if Tom is doing this last night.
I was surprised to see how much we loved each other.
So I asked myself, ‘ Can I help you? ’
It was just a matter of concern to me that რჲმ was unable to tell me what to do.
I was wondering if he's able to find something.
Well, he's a driver's license.
It was just a matter of concern to me that Tom's said he would do it.
I was surprised to see how much I had learned from the Bible that God’s name is Jehovah.
