Welsh Assembly members are concerned about the similarity of “the foolish dolls (muppet)”
Some members of the Assembly are seriously concerned with the proposal, their current rank is changed by the name of MWP (the member of the Parliament of the Electoral Parliament).
The issue has arisen because it is planned to change the name of the Assembly of Wales as a parliament.
Members of different political directions of Assembly say that they may become objects of ridicule.
A member of the Assembly says that his group is concerned that “it is a nation of Twp and Pwp.”
No-Eleans for readers: in Wales twp is sound, and pwp fox.
And one of the members of the Assembly said that his team was not happy, and a few alternative names were presented.
Welsh Conservatives said they met a new name, but they noticed that when they expressed MWP, it was very similar to the word Muppet (the TV series of foolish dolls in the UK).
In this context, the Welsh Letter w will be used as a u letter in Latvian English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on the draft of the new name, says: “The final decision on the definition of the name of the members of the Assembly, of course, is made by members.”
By the decision of the Government of Wales, the Alliance of Wales received the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public review of the options, where a wide support for the assembly received a proposal to the Parliament of Wales.
As for the position of the members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name "A member of the Parliament of Wales", or WPM, but MWP variants received more support during public reviews.
The members of the Assembly still choose alternative options, so the consensus will be concerned that the decision to make changes should be made within a few weeks.
The reform law also includes other changes in the work of Assembly, including disclosure rules of the members of the Assembly and the system of communications.
The members of the Assembly will receive the final decision on the name of the bill during the debates on the draft.
The Macedonians hold a referendum to change the name of the country
Sunday voters decide whether to get a new name from the country "Northern Republic of Macedonia."
The voting was appointed because of the ongoing dispute with neighbor Greece for decades, since they also have a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long been proven to be his North-Western neighbor in the name of this claim in its territories and is constantly opposed to the share of its membership in the EU and NATO.
The President of the Macedonian Giorgi Ivanov, the opponent of the name change of the pseudo, says that he does not pay attention to the voting.

St. Martin’s church calls were used because it is difficult to church in Harvard.
“The people I talked about,” said Mr. Adam, “and the church was historically in every district.”
“There is no one today.”
He said he'd get out of the bars.
Today, he said: “People are different,” he said.
“The bars are no longer in the place of neighborhoods where the neighbors are constantly going.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money he received by selling assets does not exceed the amount of money that the leaders claim, “and sooner or later they will be again in the place where they started.”
Churches may change with cooperative residential buildings, where people who do not take care of the remaining temples in the neighborhood, added him.
“The majority of the cooperatives of these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore, they will speed up the day when all these churches will be closed, because the people of this cooperative buildings will not become a member of these churches.”
Both churches are built in white reviving until Harlem became black metropolitan - the Church of the City Society in 1870, and St. Martins - ten years later.

In 1939 the fire was damaged, but because the recovery plan was developed by the father Johnson Municipality, the call was also held.
Dear David Johnson, the son of Johnson, and the successor of this career was called “the requisite of the call of people.”
In July, the writer of Carlyon called him another name: "Cultural Treasures" and "The Unlimited Historical Instrument".
Tyhan Ngg, an expert from the University of Michigan, also noted it was Dionysio A. Lindis, the first black musician in the world, who moved to the church of Riversey 18 years ago.
Mr. Maryveller said that St. Martin’s Church did not change it.
During the last months, St. Martin’s Church was a complex plan of architects and contractors, part of the contribution to the Church of Carrean assistants, by the rest of the Bishop.
The Council of the Church - the Chairman of the Church, consisting of the Karelian Aids - in July the Diocese of the Diocese of the Diocese, was ordered to write to the Diocese to the Council, although this latter was not involved in renting architects and contractors sent by the Diocese.

The other cromel can be punished for the actions that his previous party Thomas committed in the previous century.
Ser William Turnerfe is an excellent work for the 19th century attitude towards the cromel, and is a part of the history of the person who belongs to many opinions today.

One thing that can be sure is that the conflict in the 17th century gave a push after the development of our nation, and the Cromel was an important representative of one side.
His as the Lord’s Defender, achievements also deserve to celebrate and honor him."

Until then, Reinders hosts Rapid Vienna in the European League, on Thursday.
In the meantime, Liwingston continues to move to Divosion, with the main coach at Holveli, not yet to take a match after changing Kenya Miler in the last month.
Liwingston did not use chances of Guests
The Holt team had to take a long time before the goal was withdrawn, their direct game was a problem in all zones.
Scott Robinson was well wounded, but the last shot was broken at the door, and then Alan Lithgou was able to hit the Creig Holkit door only to the door.
The hosts were happy to give them the opportunity to play ahead of them, knowing that the problems were solved after the game was updated from standard situations.
And that was a tactic, in which the ball passed.
Reingers gave free shot and Liwingerson worked on opening, Delan Galaher and Robinson joined meinga to get a shot and scored from the juridor center.
At the moment, Reinger had the advantage of possession of the ball, but the defending against the opponent was infringed, and he didn't create problems.
This situation continued to be in the second half, but Alfredo Morel was shot and the door was saved by Kelly.
Côte d’Alan McGregori was on the foot, and Lithgomi was shot from a distance while playing Liwingston's other standard condition.
In the Liwingston Jury, the ball was always taken out of the penalty, but two penalts were appointed - after changing the holkit Glen Medton, and for the second hand game - both had to climb the door.

They're sometimes very good under the guidance of Gerard, this time you lost a lot before this standard.
Their final ball could not be taken – only once the host team was caught up, it's time to wake up, they're in the middle of the table.

U.S. has to double funding with artificial intelligence
Kay-fu Lim, Inventor and Artificial Intelligence Practice, which has experience in working with companies like Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that because China becomes more active in the aspects of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money that is spent on studies.
This comment was published after various parts of the American government made applications regarding artificial intelligence, and highlighted the fact that America has no formal strategy formed on this topic.
During this time, China presented its plan in the last year: it plans to become an artificial intelligence number 1 leading state in 2030.
“The sum of money for research will be a good beginning for the American, if we consider how the other countries are back in this aspect of the U.S. and we also expect new achievements,” Lim said.
The increase of funds will further increase the chance that the further new discovery will be in America with the introduction of artificial intelligence, said Lim on the current week of CNBC interviews.
Lii, whose book "Article Intellection Supervision: China, Silk Road and New Encirclement of the World" was published in this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the largest artificial intelligence organizations in China.
In the 1980s, he worked on artificial intelligence systems, which were defeated by the U.S. higher ranking players, Carnegie Mellon University, later he was the executive of Microsoft Research and President of Google Branch of China.
Li Symptoms of the U.S. government expressed the competition of robots working on the defensive systems, and they wondered when the next similar event would be held, even more well-known for the prospects of the future.

"No China brings us academic leaders, but also corporations," he said.

Lim also said that Immigration reforms can also promote the development of artificial intelligence.
“I think the green cards should be automatically asked by people with artificial intelligence,” he said.
The China State Consultant presented its next generation of artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
Lim noted that the China Foundation of Natural Sciences funds scientists like the state agencies, and these fundings can also be obtained by American citizens, but the degree of research in China is even lower.
At least recently, the Department of Defence has established the United Art Intelligence Center in the United States, the main purpose of which is to unite people in industrial and academic aspects.
The organization DARPA has also announced a 2 billion dollars investment that they are going to implement in the project called AI Next.
In addition to the organization NSF, DAPRA annually invests 100 million investments with artificial intelligence.
Nevertheless, the American legislative body, which was asked to create a security committee with an artificial intelligence, did not make any move in this month.

“We also want NATO and the EU, but we want to unite in these organizations, not at the cost of helping others.
"We're a poor country, but we're worth it.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can contact Russia and China and become members of the European Union."
The Prime Minister Zaev said that integration in NATO will bring more benefits in the field of investment in Macedonia, the country in which the level of unemployment is high by 20 percent.
“I believe that most people will do this because 80 percent of the country’s NATO and the EU are united,” Zaev said when filling their newsletter.

Trump manages promotions in Western Virginia.
President Almaty spoke about events that were involved in the situation of the Republican Party, which has their intermediate elections.
"Everything we've done is going to be the result in November.
We're just about five weeks away from the most important elections in our lives.
That's one of the greatest events -- I'm as if I'm not going to run, but actually I'm trying to fight for these great candidates," he said.
Trump also added, "You see the terrible, terrible groups of democrats, and you're watching all this time.
They're trying to regain power using all their efforts, you see this irrespective and dirty.
They're not interested in who they're going to be. They're not interested in who they're going to go, the main thing is to gain power and control, that's what they want and control, and we're not going to give them up."
He said that the current main mission of democracy is to “contain and resist.”
“And you can see that during the last four days,” he said, and he responded to the Democrats "How are Brazils, rudes, and unreliable they are."
In addition, he also addressed the court committee of Senate. He applied to Senate Democrats Senator Diene Finstas, who received a pretty noisy feedback from the attendees.
"Do you remember his answer?
Do you have official documents from you?
Ah, Ah, what?
No, that was a gesture of the worst body in the language of the worst -- the worst I've ever seen."
The work is no longer like the church.
He's not the only one who speaks about what he thinks.
When my party's driving force activists gave my censor a voice, I was very surprised.
After all, I'm the last one I don't want to get - and all this is just about talking about what I think about.
My parliamentary colleague Collega, Joan Rayan, received a similar answer, because he was legally released against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the Civil Movement was aggressive because of problems with Jeremy Corbin.
Jeremy’s predecessor leaders also did not have the same topics, such as handling the economic policy on the state’s initial states, Europe, and similar problems.
A letter to the attendees at the East Nongham meeting said, "The meeting will be inclusive and productive."
8 years after a local MP stay, a Friday night meeting for me was like this.
Unfortunately, the meetings that have been held today have not been carried out on the same token, and the policy of "good and polite" was forgotten if there has ever been such a thing.
It is quite clear that in the Labour Party of the Labour Party, it has an untolerant attitude, and each opinion is criticized only by whether the leaders of the party agree with it.
It soon began after Jeremy became a leader, as Kolega would expect me to change my opinion on different matters, and I would contact a position that I would never agree with in my life - the Gönd State Defense theme on the EU sided trade.
When I talk publicly - you have all this importance in social networks - all this is quite a lot of violence by requesting a period of elections, the request of the political centre and the request of the exit from my party.
And that's not just my experience.
On the contrary, I consider myself lucky, because the comment was still political.
I'm trying to get rid of the professionalism and efforts of the colleagues, who have to listen to sexist and racial pisss every day, but they never get rid of them.
In today's politics, it's a disappointing fact that such violence has become normal for us.
In the last week, Jeremy Tskhinn said that the Labour Party had to establish the tradition of tolerance culture.
And the reality is that we don't like the church, and every "unstable" step or change when changing the party's innerity.
In the past two years, I received quite a lot of advice to spend my head, not to raise my voice, and only in the same case "all would be fine."
But that's not what I've done in politics.
After 32 years, I became a member of the Labour Party at school, and this decision was caused by the policy carried out by Tetcheri, which was disassembled by the classroom system, I was aimed at the aspects of the civil service that I need most - Ged as a local representative or as a government minister.
I will never hide my policy, even on last elections.
There was no one confused about my political position, and I had the right to be with the current ruling party.
In order to get them to the Friday meeting, the only thing that I want to say is that when your country goes to Brexit, which is able to damage real estate, business and civil service, I can't guess why you need to spend time and energy on similar loyalty attitude towards the leader of the Labour Party.
But one message that I think is not for the members of the Nongham movement, but for my colleagues, ლეიბორისტებს, and others: I am proud that I have the opportunity to approach you, and I promise that no dark or bad political goals can help me to do anything that I believe in serving your best interests.

Eyi 38 - 17 Mulrous: The unreliable Eyi Tablo
The last two meetings were able to have some impact on the final result, but it is no doubt that Ayi was worthy of the triumphal victory that this team achieved in the premiere of the Tennis.
Now they're on the side of the tattoo, the only unrestrained one between the ten teams.
Finally, using their good protection and chances, the team was able to establish a dominant position at home, so that's why the coach, Peter Marashi was so happy.
“In each game we have verified opportunities, and we are still unsupported, so that's why I should be happy,” he said.
Robin Christy, from Melrous, said: "Honor is coming, they're better using chances for us."
At the 14th minute, Grant Anderson tried to create a team of Frazier Climo, but for Scotland’s capital, Kviri Hughi gave a large impression on Volor and allowed melrowz and Jason Bisen.
After that, Climo was able to increase the advantages of the ei, exactly until the first time, and made the score 17-5.
The second half began quite well. Therefore, with Patrick Anderson's integrity and in the Bagot Finn, they were able to reduce the advantage of five points.
This was followed by a serious tram of Rurid Noti, which had to leave the square, but Eir was still able to cut away, and with the service of the Macdoval Climate, Climate performed a serious tram.
The active Captain Blair MacFarson has closed the yellow card again, as a result of which Melbouse has made an unsuccessful attempt to convert the players into a great bonus.
The players at home were able to spin the game, and when Struan Hachison received a yellow card for climo modification, McFoverson was able to put the mouse in front of Eur Maul.

'The sea is ours': the land’s locked Bolivia hope that the court will release the way to the quiet ocean.
The sailers are patriotics of the Rijing-Clede Division in La Paza.
The dark blue flag of public institutions will free of charge.
Maritime bases from Tsitaka to amazon, the following motottos are: "In the season, the sea is ours.
And his return is our duty."
Boliv's locked up is due to the 19th Coupon conflict, which ended with the blood of Chile – that's what this conflict still faces in a quiet ocean.
Five years after reviewing, Bolivia is looking forward to the decision of the International Court on October 1, which should come out.
“Bolivia has a momentum, feeling of unity and purity, and of course, looking forward to a positive answer,” said Roberto Kazaladze, Bolivia Diplomatics.
Many Bolivians are going directly to the ether of the international trial, and of course most of them believe that after decades, Chile will be assigned to establish negotiations with the country and give up on the sea.
Evo Moldova, Bolivi Windmill President – which awaits the future elections – also has its opinion on Monday’s procedures.
"We're very close to the Pacific," said last August.
But part of the analytics thinks that the chances of making decisions in favor of Bolivia are very low, and if that is true, it will not change much.
One of the centers of the United Nations in the Netherlands has no influence on the area of Chile, and said that their intervention will not affect this negotiation.
The International Court said that the sentence came from the final hearing in six months, which means that the case was not "fast," said Paz Záratet, an international law expert.
And the improvement of Bolivia, perhaps, the last four years of the last one, may have been in the back.
“The return of the exit to the sea was taken by the Bolivian administration,” Záratet said.
The Boliv War of Bolivia may even make the last drop of Chile’s lovingness, he said.
Bolivi and Chile will start negotiations at some point, but their continuation will be very difficult after all.
This two countries were not sent to each other in 1962.
The former president of Bolivia and the representative of the country in Hagaa, Eduard Rodriguez Walls, rejected the opinion that the trial was unusually fast.
Monday will give Bolivia the chance to “open new opportunities for new relationships with Chile” and will give the chance to “trust 139 years of conflict with both sides,” he said.
Calabsidia also rejected the morality - one of the most popular presidents of America – used the conflict as a political handshake.
"Bolivia will never give a chance to go to a quiet ocean," she added.
"The return of the pass is the chance to prove that we have come from the past."
North Korea said that atomic deployment process will not start before they trust America

The display version was made by Valentine, and the details involved in it were a massive bumble that was fully paid by the models.
Among other huge accessorys there were cut springs, magic hats and ananas - but their main goal is not to keep your heat.
Tom Brown also published a collection of his strange masks -- exactly when Halloween broke the door.
Most of them are fully covered by the lips and are represented by the canybal lecturer rather than the representative of the fashionable world.
One of the creations was taken to the Silk’s garment, with its swimming glasses and lasces, when the other had the form of ice cream.

John Edard: having foreign languages is an important skill for citizens of the world
The Association of Independent Schools of Scotland implements monitoring the results of academic success, and this process continues to be conducted in 2018, by focusing on good academic performance, which is even stronger in sport, art, music and other public fields.
The school is a representative of 30,000 students, consulated by the independent schools of Scotland, and they are always trained for students and parents to provide the highest level of service.
Independent schools try to prepare their students for higher education, for their chosen career and to be a world citizen.
As a educational sector, which is able to create relevant curriculum in schools, we see foreign languages as the most popular and demand for the future, which will be chosen in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in the language that he understands, it's actually reflected in his mind.
If you talk to her in his native language, she goes straight into the heart."
This once reminds us that we can't rely only on English, when we try to build relationships and trust with representatives of different countries.
Among the independent schools, the results of the recent exams are that the higher points and rating of foreign languages are distinguished by the highest points and rating.
68 percent of foreign students received the highest score A.
According to the data collected by the SCIS partner from 74 schools, 72 percent of students took the highest score in Chinese when 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also gained higher evaluation.
This once again represents the fact that the independent schools of Scotland support the development of foreign languages as a key skill for the future for children.
Ennis are currently as much attention as STEM (Science, Technologies, Engineering Mathematics) in independent schools and other places.
As a result of the survey related to employment in the UK in 2014, 17 percent of the applicants have been refraining from the language barrier of the application.
Therefore, more and more attention to foreign languages to prepare young people for the career of the future.
In the global world, the number of jobs in different languages increases the demand for these skills.
Despite the career choices, if someone learns another language, they will have a true advantage in the future to be able to make the most of the possible skills.
Talking to a person in his native language of another ethnicity, a person will always go ahead in the field of employment.
According to YouGov survey, between 4,000 British adolescents in 2013, 75 percent of them were not able to communicate in any other language, and 15 percent could only be able to make a simple dialogue in French.
And now when learning language is important to our children, so we're investing in this issue.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those countries who have growing economy, will equip children with skills that will be important for their cultivation.
In Scotland, each school will be different according to the classes of foreign languages.
The part of the school is concentrated in popular classical languages when the second part is focused on languages that will be important for the United Kingdom in 2020, and these languages are Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever, interest in your child will always be seen in the language that will interest him and be able to learn from experienced employees and specialists.
The association of independent schools of Scottish schools is continuing to create the desired educational environment for children and wants to equip them with all the necessary skills needed for the future.
No one can deny that foreign languages play a great role in the economic development of the country, and all this should be reflected in education.
Moreover, foreign languages should be considered as "the ability to communicate internationally."
Independent schools will continue to offer choice, diversity and higher quality for students.
It must be done.
John Edwards Scottish Independent School Director

The letter requested to fill the Supreme Court with the confirmation of the trump is going to create support for intermediate selections, because there is a risk of losing control in the congress, in November.
What is the meeting of the West Virginia, and how do we look at it online?
A meeting of Trump Viiling Western Virginia was held for 7 hours. Today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow the track directly by tracking the channel link below.
At a large meeting, Trump presented the nomination of the Supreme Court Brut Kavanaup, which was involved in the conflict related to sexual violence in the last few days, which is investigated by the Federal Investigation Bureau.
But the main goal of these meetings is to gain certain confidence for November elections.
Therefore, the Trump Campaign office said that the next five meetings are aimed at strengthening and supporting the “intention and support of the Georgian work, because the republics try to protect the majoritarians and make them even more stronger at the Senate and representatives’ house,” Ratesers said.
“The establishment of control on the congress is important because the President is planning to move to more state during the current busy electoral campaign,” said the speaker of the Trump Campaign, who rejected that he was called Rotters.
According to the Western Virginia Metro Nius, the meeting will be held at the Vestbank Stadium in Vilnko, may be held in the Vilnko Stadium, and all this will be reflected by the media of the Pitsburg Media.”

“It is not a good sign for Moorei when the predecessor goes to attract supporters,” says Saymon Heder, a political scientist from West Virginia University.
Raider Cup 2018: The United States team is hoping to go to the individual tournament on Sunday
After the three-sided season, four-sided competitions on Saturday evening may be the same as the radar cup for so long.
The changing of Bidgg and fate is a completely profitable model in sport, but athletes still remain hopeful, especially in the competition like the Rayder Tattoo.
But what do they say now, where is their momentum?
"We had six-six advantages, and now four, so we think that's why we think that's a little bit older," says Jordan Spitt, if he went to the destination today.
Of course, Europe enjoys benefits, has four additional points and the chances of extracting 12 points.
Americans, as Spitt says, feel that they have a very little feeling of fear, because they have a very big motivation before the game, this shows the level of Spti and Jaistin Thomas game, who have won three points together and four.
The Spite was irresistible in the whole field, and that's what it's going to be.
After a solemn griam round, it became even more louder, because Thomas and Spite had two points.
In the 15th century, the winners of his arrival were also attracted by similar shouts, which indicated that Americans were not going to go out of the championship.
"One thing you're going to do is think about, and I'm worried about my own game," Spitt said.
That's what each player has for this moment.
They are left for 18 orthodox installation.
The only players who have more than a score of Spite and Thomas are Franchesco Molinar and Tom Flytwood, a rival story from the Raider Cup.
In Europe, there are no great advantages, but the wonderful couple put all four to four, and it is impossible to escape.
"Molywood" is the only place where they didn't shoot Bogei on Saturday evening, they hit themselves on Saturday morning, Friday evening and Friday morning at 9 pm.
Based on the above meeting, and according to the energy that both players have, it is obvious that there is not a funny presence of viewers that no player will cover European victory and the sun will definitely be on Le Golf National or Molinari.
Maybe both of them, but they're different.
But still talking about the European glory is still a long time.
Buba Wotson and web Vimpson performed a small work from Sergio გარსia, a four-year-old hero that began with Alex Noren.
Bogei and two double points gained Spanish and throw Sweden and never have been so close to obtaining advantages.
But on Sunday, there's no one who can use you to go out of your pit.
Four-sided and paired games are very interesting to watch, because they look at the relationship of couples, advice they give each other and strategy that can be changed suddenly.
Europe played a really better game as a team and a noticeable advantage for the last day, but the American team also showed that they have a perspective to fight and do not plan to stand on the page, so everything is still suspicious.
Europe gains 10-6 advantages for the Final Day of Raider Cup
Europe will take a huge advantage of the final day after they defeated the United States team during the weekend and won 10-6 victorys.
Tom Flyutwood and Franchesco Molinary won the victory on Taiger Wood, which tried to move on the couple, Le Golf National.
Thomas Bioin from Europe suspects that he will be able to return the cup that he won two years ago, because Europe dominated the game of morning pairs in America and won 3-1 wins.
The United States need more endurance, despite the two victorys they cannot reach to the end of their goal.
Jim Fari Team needs eight points from the 12th of the week to earn a cup.
Flytwood is the first European New Year, which was able to win four-year-olds after he and Molinar won a sensational victory in "Moliwood" and drew closer to the sensational victory of the Rayder Cup.
After the death of Woods and Patrick Rid, their main goal is to defeat the American New Year, Braison Dechembaus, as well as 5&4 points.
While Woods showed a great game on Saturday, he had 19 out of 29 games, where he was killed seven times a year.
Jastin Rose chose to enjoy the four-hour holidays, he is a partner of Henryk Sternson, with which he lost 2&1 in his work with Dan Johnson and Bruk Koeka in the first and third players in the world.
In the south of Paris, Europe had no simple games.
The winners of the three-way trips, Jordan Spite and Jattsen Thomas set a two-band limit after the game with Americans.
They won 2&1 victory with the Spanish, John Ram and Jan Poulter, and then returned to the poster and Rory Maqlari 4&3 account, where the couple took the first two two-months of the solvent.
During the whole history, only two times the team made a belt from the four-scale arrival, and it is also worth mentioning that the final team only needs to combine scores to win.
After two days of top-up stay, more than a week's contributor is expected.
North Korea claims that “no-like case” does not intend to separate one-sided, without gaining trust
During the conversation with the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said that the establishment of sanctions leads to more distrust toward the American and does not intend to deploy nuclear weapons.
R. Yong Hom told the general Assembly of the world that China took "bigal steps" for the past few years and stopped the testing of nuclear and military weapons, even more well studied their study and said that they would not spread the nuclear weapons and nuclear technology even more.
“But we don’t see the proper answer and action from the US.” he said
"We will not be confident in our state security and due to such conditions, we will not be the first to deployment of our country."
When R made a statement, about what resistance they have to take for the United States’s current "fast", in its statement, it seemed that he would not fully reject a single-sided act that was carried out two years ago.
Ry also noted the agreements and disadvantages of the three-tribe elections held on June 12, where Kim Tramp promised, "According to the Colrey Peninsula" when Trump promised him the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has been carrying to the formal end of the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States said that the fhenian nuclear weapons must first be put to the end.
Washington also avoided the conversation about the removal of sanctions in North Korea.
"American requires "Privacy" from Korean and increase the pressure in the form of sanctions, and also rely on "Discovering the end of the war," said Rim.
"I think the sanctions can be our reservation, is just a dream for those who have no idea about us.
But the problem is that the activity of the sanctions will enhance our distrust.
What does not explain about the plans planned between Kim and Trump, which American leader emphasized the United Nations meeting on the weekend.
Instead, the Minister emphasized the three meetings held with the South Korea leader of the South Korea and added: “The problem of deployment, instead of the South Korea, would not be the same as the Korean Peninsula.”
Despite what the Tony released, it was significantly different than what he had in the United Nations meeting last year. The General Assembly, aimed at the negotiations of the United States and North Korea, became uninterrupted after the “master of wicked President” Trump called “The Man of Raketti.”
This is a united meeting, a trump, which last year was promised with a full refund of Kim and North Korea, praised the leader of North Korea, but noted that even more work and sanctions will continue to affect more than Korea does not start the deployment process.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have time for "If it takes two years, three or five months -- no matter."
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Consultant should be awarded for the step towards the step of the purchasing.
When the United States Secretary told the United Nations Security Consultation on Thursday, that: “The Security Consultant must continue to implement the orders of one-on-one, without any failure, to finally confirm the penalty.”
The Security Consultant in 2006 has signed the sanctions of North Korea in order to limit and reduce funding in the development of atomic and firearms.
Pompeo met what the UN meeting was and told him that it would come to Florence for the next month to plan the next three.
PMOPOO North Korea has been visited three times this year, but his last meeting was not so well.
He left the plenary in July to say that the progress only reached the North Korea by creating his "depth Needs".
North Korea pledged to look at the process of detergenting in the current month and "to make necessary measures."
RMI said that Kim told him that the "right measures" that he had been running is security guarantees that the trump promised him to Singapore and where he promised to normalize his relationship with Washington.
Harvard Students took the course for a sufficient rest
Harvard University has raised all students in a special course that is concentrated on teaching students enough to relax, while the trend of the attitude towards the young generation is developing daily.
Academicians found that students who study the number of students at the first university do not even know how to treat themselves.
Charles Citsler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and Physician of Bregami and Women’s Hospice, created this course, which is the first one in the United States.
He decided to start a similar course after he learned how to break sleep on learning.
'After one meeting, one girl came to me and said, "Why do I talk to me about this now, at my end of the year?'
He said that no one told him about the need to sleep before he was born, which made me wonder, "He told me a televisionwriter.
The course, took root in the year, and its main goal is to explain to students how a good sleep manera has a profound impact on academic and sports performance, and also in general the condition of health.
Paul Barrier, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive at the University of Health Services, said that the university was presenting a similar course after he decided to see how many children had suffered during the week.
One hour course includes a set of interactive tasks.
One of the sections is the image of various colors such as coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books and love the impact of caffeine and solar rays, and how their result is reflected in the sports perspective, and what is the importance of having a sleep routine.
In another section, attendees will ask about how level of sleep can be developed in case of infrastructure, obesity and depression.
Map placed in campus, with its signs, gives students to think about their blog routine.
'We know that it's not changing the behavior of students at all.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as they know what the consequences of smoking,” said Professor Sosler.
'The culture of the night' still exists, he said, and added that the increased pressure of modern technologies and students helps to increase sleep disorder.
A good, quality sleep should be presented to the "the secret weapon of the studio" to fight stress, withdraw and irritation - also to avoid excessiness, because the lack of sleep in our body scares us and makes them constantly hungry.
Remond Sou, 19-year-old Kalympinian, who studied chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Szolner in order to create a course, after the soum had passed with him last year, as a newdemise passed a single class with professors.
He said that Taurus gave him the eyes of his eyes and gave the motivation to create a pharmaceutical concept course.
The next step in his hope is to ask all graduates to go to a similar course, rather than join in the training environment again.
Professor Sizler advises students to install the alarm before bedtime as well as wake up, and in his opinion, students should avoid ‘Lurj Shx’ which makes electrical screens and LED light reflects, and can change the rhythm of the heart, which causes further sleep violations.
Liwingston 1 - 0 Reinches: Minga Goli Jerrydridge's Boys
Reingerer tried another failure to visit Doli Minga Golo defeated Stephen Jerryd team score 1-0.
The IBRUX side expected to fix the first winning, after 4–1 victory at Seint Johnstoun last February, but the team of Gary Holt was able to run Germany and gave him the second failure on the position of the manager in 18 game and left his team with eight points back to the leader’s heart.
The wind blows seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the winding line, which was not at the height of the flight.
When the Reinders drop down in the sixth place, Liwingstson took the third place and only one goal is to take Hibernian.
And in addition, the reinsurgency may have an additional problem, since the player of their main composition was injured in the head with a shot from the outside.
During the game, the Gerard made eight changes to the team's only part of the game, which can run into the fourth final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, passed the same 11th of the same week, which took him to the score, and he is grateful for how his reaction leads to the form of players at each meeting.
Maybe the reintelligent has more possession of the ball, but Liwingstock made more than they did.
You should take two minutes before the reinchemistry is going to take two minutes before menga could take the ball for the first time, but the attack of the Reinches, the half of the opponents, broke up.
Kigan Jikoba's penalty shot reached the screenper Crega, but the defending player, Alan Letgoum was able to send the ball back.
Reingery was able to win the ball again, but finally they were not in hope but in faith.
Alfredo Morel believed that he was given a chance to hit the penalt, after Steven Loullie's defeated Stephen Loullie, but the judge asked for time.
Renaissances were hardly able to implement two shots in the first half of the game, but for the opponent team, Lia Kelly was not so difficult for Lasana and Oyye Ejaria.
At this time, Liwingston's solvent blow might have been crucial at the 34th minute, and no one rejects it.
Reindications were not able to deal with the deep protection of Jikia.
Côte d’Arfild did nothing for Dechelan Gallery gave the ball to Robinson, who was subject to the ball and gave the Minga to complete the attack.
Gerard changed the rating and changed a certain effect on the vial, but the bloc made by the defending player was allocated.
But Liwingstson was still able to keep the desired pace, and that's why it's the destruction of the opponent, using long passes of Lithuania and the hacket.
The Holt team was able to take advantage of the last time, but it was firmly standing in the McGregor Square and each man was not allowed to be taken away than the Lithuanian team was from far away.
The change of reingergers, Glen Medalon also requested a penalt to be appointed at the end of the game, but the judge refused to do so.
Almaty: Inventor of Gager Millel
And now page from our "Sunday Morning" Almania: 30 September, 1882, 136 years ago, and the counting process is going on...days when the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Han" was born in Germany.
Gigager invented a method of dissolution and discovery of radioactive activity, which laid the foundation of the Gager mountain.
Since then in science, the Giorgi mountainer has become part of the populousist, as well as in the 1950 film "Colorido call", where the dialogue of scientist Roy Rogers and Dil Evans is given:
Men: "What's the world?"
Rogers: This is a miger mountain, it is used to use radioactive minerals like Urinim.
When you do these headphones, you can understand the impact of the atoms of minerals, which is radioactive."
Evans: "You say, he really blows this moment!"
He died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
Cancer new vaccin teaches the discovery of the immune system of detergent cells
Cancer new vaccin teaches the immune system to discover and kill the broken cells.
Discovering cells with vaccin is part of treatment.
The method includes separation of immune cells from the patient’s body and their laboratory change.
After the change, you can find the proteins that are characteristic of many types of cancer, and then make their reintegration.
Experimental vaccination shows a satisfying result of cancer patients.
As a result of its use, one of the women’s ovaries has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes extraction of immune cells, their change in laboratory conditions in order to “search” the protein HER2, which is characteristic of many types of cancers. After that, their regeneration occurs.
Professor of the United States Department of Cancer in Maryland, J. Berzosch says: “The results show us that vaccination is a hope.”
“HER2 leads to increasing such a kind of symptom, such as chest, ovaries, lung and intestinal” - notes it.
A similar approach with immune cells is also used to treat leukemia.
Kenya West has launched protrampic adventures. It's broadcasting "Saturday Night Live" with the title: "Let America Again Great".
All this color didn't have a good time.
The report of the Cany West has led to a dissatisfaction in the transmission. In its perspective, he is the President of the United States Donald Trump, and he said that he is still buying a voting for President in 2020.
During the third song, during the performance of the third song, he jumped on the hat with the inscription: “Let America come back to the great.” His emotional speech was directed against democracy and was again confirmed by the support of the trump.
"How many times I'm talking to a white, they're saying, "How can you like a trump when he's a race?"
We said, "If I was worried about races, I've been going to be a long time ago from Amsterdam."
The program "Saturday Night Live" started with a scooter in which the Hollywood Star Meth Deidmon summarized the display of the Brat Cavano before the Legal Committee of Senate. Cavano Christine Fordde accused bets in sexual harassment.
While the West’s speech is not covered by TV, it’s uploaded to the social network by the Commissioner Chris Rock.
It's unknown if you tried to give Rock to West.
Vesta also was afraid that beyond the scene, he also faced problems with the hat.
"I'm substantiated beyond the stage.
They said, "Don't go to the stage with you."
They were humiliated!
And then they said that I was caught," - says Washington Examiner's West.

Kit believes that in order to increase this problem, some have contributed to the existence of massive heroes on TV.
He continues: "What are natural and what are the teachings?

Aids: China speaks about 14% of new cases
China announced that the number of people increased by 14% of AIDS virus.
More than 820,000 people are infected with the country, say representatives of the Ministry of Health.
About 40,000 new cases were recorded in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of them were given sex through which they differ from past experiences.
Traditionally, HIV virus spread quickly in different parts of China.
But the number of people suffering this way was almost zero, says the representatives of the Ministry of Health of China on the conference held in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people suffering from AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China since the year 2000.
The HIV virus transfer is a significant problem in the China LGBT community.
The Declaration of homosexuality occurred in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT individuals continues there.
Studies show that due to the conservative values of the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually get married to a woman.
Treatment of disease occurs due to the use of wrong ways in sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised that access to AIDS treatment will be universal in order to solve this problem.
Maxine Wotters refuses to leak the data of the Republican Party Senators from the Staff members, calling him “satisfactory lies” and “theories of the Recommendations.”
A member of the American Chamber of Commerce Maxine Wonders rejects the common charges on Saturday that the member of the Staff issued personal information of three republican Senators and placed it on the pages of Bitcoin.
He argued that accusations were ruled by ultra-right experts and websites.
"Teachers, lies, and even more contempt lie," says Wotters in his statement, published on the truck.
The common personal information included the addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator, Lindsey Greheim and Yutas Senators, Mike Lisa and Orn Hechi's House.
The information appeared on Thursdays by an unknown person in the online space. At this time, the Panel hearing was held on the candidate of the Uznasian Court of Justice, Brut Cavano’s sexual harassment.
The information was leaked after three Senators asked caavano questions.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState say that the post was uploaded from the IP address associated with the Veterinary Office.
"It's a fault, it's wrong and absolute," Walter continues.
“The member of my stadium is not in any way responsible for the leaking of this information. We have achieved a compromise that is about their identity, personal information and security.
"It's a fault, it's a false and absolute lie."
The Voter’s claim quickly followed critical assessments, including the former press-General Army of the White House.
"He's angry rejects it," Flasher writes.
"This fact tells us that Walter doesn't need a temperament for membership of the Congress.
When someone blames him for something he didn't commit, a person will not be angry.
A man is not stubborn.
A person does not ask questions about the motives of the defendant.
But he keeps calm and insufficient."
The flusher seems to compare the reaction of the owter’s reaction to the criticism of Democrats, who was charged against critics on the fact that during the Thursday hearing, it seemed very angry.
Omar Navaro, a candidate of the Republican, who will be able to take the lead in the intermediate elections, also called his views on the Trump.
"Great, if it's true" he said about the truck.
In its statement, U.S. said that his cabinet warned "Custom Services and Law enforcement bodies on this fraud."
“We will ensure that the blames were revealed,” he continued, “and that they are legally responsible for all their actions that are devastating and dangerous for any of my employees and all members of my employees.”
Johnny New Attacks in English - Rhine Atkinsson's weak party by spying
Now it's been a tradition to search for the importance of the Brexit in any new film by British trend and it seems that it's about this new version of John's English-Commediary Jean-Georgian Parliament François – which has started in 2003 with John Jings and was changed in 2011 by John John Jinning.
Ironic self-sacrifice should become a new opportunity to export our nation to the subject of what obvious garbage are we?
In any case, the tracks-screen, a fine non-competent Johnny English license has been updated to spoil everything. He's the name of other things is more than signaling that he is a wide comic creature that is designed for not English-speaking filmmate areas.
Of course, it is a silly secret agent that has a little bit of Club properties, Missor apartment bars, and an adult ultrasonic properties of the Jackel, which is contributed to the motto of the fire carriage, in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
It is also originally based on a traveler and an international secret man, who Atkinson played once in the Barclaycard TV Advertisements that were on his way.
One or two good moments are in the last part of Johnny New York.
I liked when John in English was dressed in the mid-scale book of midfielders, and the people of Rotors are constantly reintroduction to his muses.
The face is the talent of the physical comedy of Atkinson, but the humor seems to be slightly reduced and strange, especially when the brands of the "small" film, such as 007 and the unsupported mission itself are self-confidenced to offer the commission as a ingredient.
It's as if humor is designed for children not for adults, and for me John J. J. J. J. J. J. J. J. J., and for me, the foolish sufferings in England are not so creative and focus on as jokes of Atkinson's stupid films in Mr. Binn.
Currently, the constant current message is that the UK is a serious problem.
Cyber Hacker has introduced the super secret web site of UK spyers, revealed the identity of all UK field agents, before the next agent's concern - Kevin Eldon's small role.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a pseudonym and a fighter figure that has been experiencing the full creator of political inpulsion: Ema Tompson does the maximum for this quiz-terzea character, but there is nothing to work in the scenario.
His advisors are informed in the direction of intelligence, based on the fact that every spy is comproxed, he should be refunded from the pension.
This means that John himself is going to go into English, he is currently working as a teacher in some of the universities, but he does not necessarily teach how to become a secret spy: Here are some good jokes when he offers a school of spying Rocks.
In New York, they were brought back to Whithoh to the emergency Brong and were re-abunded by their former numerous suffering teams, who still play Ben Miler.
Bafi is now a married man, married to the head of the underwater boat, the role of cheerful hockey, where Wikip Peperdiine is slightly lost.
So, the secret of his excellence at the service, the betman and Robin are again in action, suddenly meet Olga Curleenko's beautiful predecessor woman, ophlia Buletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is threatened by the magic of the windism technology, which claims that the UK’s computer test is able to overcome: the criminal Jason Wolta, who plays Jack Les.
In English and Baffe of his odyses start with high-homes: scoring, they make fire in the cost of the French restaurant; they create a chaos and steal the voltage on the expensive yacht; and in English, it leads to the sacred anarchy when trying to use the virtual reality device to get acquainted with the volta’s home interior.
All stops, of course, have been pulled into this last order, but such a favorable and energetic, like that, is quite a little child's television.
It's quite a medium thing.
And as John in English, I couldn't think: can't the British film industry give Randen Athkinson the role that will really be fair for her talent?
The Labour Party refuses to make plans for Britishs to work four days a week and get five days refunds
Jeremy Corbiani's Labour Party considers a radical plan, according to which Britishs will work four days a week - but they will get five refunds.
According to the information, the Party should have the company’s heads to inform the savings received by artificial intelligence (AI) by revolution, to give them what they additional leisure day.
So the employees will be able to take three days - but return the same refund at home again.
Sources have reported that the idea of "better" is to establish a economic day of party and plans to spend the country in favor of employees.
Go to four-day weeks by the trade unions as a way to get the benefits from changing economy.
The source of high positions of the Labour Party told Sady Taimy: “It is expected to be an analysed of policy reviews until the end of this year.
'This doesn't happen suddenly, but the four-day working week is an aspiration that suits the approach of the party to balance the economy in favor of employees, as well as the common industrial strategy of the party.'
The Labour Party is not the first one who came to this idea, the Green Party in the 2017 General Election Campaign.
Aspiration is currently not fully endorsed by the Labour Party, however.
The Representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-day work week is not the political party and it is not considered by the party.”
Northwest Chancellor John McDonnell used the previous week of the Labour Party Conference to make its own vision in Economics on social economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was ready to set up power for the 'For Directors' and 'Specials' utility companies.
The North Chancellor plans also suggest that the current entrepreneurs of the water supply companies may not fully return their interests, since the LEBOTT government may be able to “detect” on the basis of the crime.
He also confirmed the plan to hold employees in the company's Council and create inclusive property funds to provide 10 percent of private sector companies to deliver employees, which is equal to the annual diversification of £500.

"I said I was hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Cavano.
I called after this, the charge was announced, I asked, "Do you have this chen?'
He was a firm, irreversible, pieces."
However, the voice of the Gremmy seems to be overwhelming.
"My mind is fully deployed in Brut Caucasus, and it will be like a dymium," he said.
"Doct. Ford, I know what happened, but I know the following: Brexit rejected it firmly," added Grammy, referring to what Christine Bladder Ford.
"And those who name it can't prove it.
This is 36 years old.
I don't see any new change."
What is the World Citizen Festival and did he do something to reduce poverty?
On this Saturday New York hosts the World Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an extremely impressive composition of the performer stars and is equally impressive to the mission; which must end the world poverty.
Now, in his seventh year, the World Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people in the central park, who will not only enjoy the Jenette Jexon, card B and Shanghai, but will be proud of the real purpose of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty in 2030.
The World Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a global poverty project, a global propagand group that hope to end poverty, to increase the number of people fighting against it.
To get free tickets (except if you want to purchase VIP tickets), the hosts would have to perform a number of tasks, or “Accessories” as a volunteer, write to the world leader, perform telephone calls, or any other important ways to raise awareness regarding the real purpose of the event, which is the end of poverty.
But, just how successful is the World Citizen Festival, 12 years before the end of the mission?
Is the idea of a free concert awarding for people to convince people to act if there is just another occasion called "clictivism" - when people think that they make a real difference with a signing online, or by posting a tremor?
Since 2011, the World Citizen has reported that he has scored more than 19 million "activity" from his supporters, making what different goals hosts.
He reported that these activities helped to overcome world leaders to declare the obligations and policy that equals more than 37 billion dollars in 2030 to affect more than 2,25 billion people’s lives.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had 390 commitments and quotes from its activities, from which at least 10 billion dollars have been distributed or collected.
By estimates of the group, the constituents had been directly influenced by more than 649 million people around the world.
Some of these obligations are the power of food, the partner of investors and performers based in the United Kingdom, committed to “to help the children to increase their full potential,” which makes up $35 million to help them end food failure in the country, after they received more than 4,700 trucks from world citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can take the social injustice of food failure,” said the Ambassador of Food Force, Tbilisi Ulman, hosted at the live concert held in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 activities were conducted, the government urged what the United Kingdom, to improve food for mothers and children, to fund the project, the food power that will reach 5 million women and children, providing food.
In response to one of the many questions that we ask, "Why do you think we can end the extreme poverty?"
The World Citizen responded: “This will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will beat and lose.
But as well as big civil rights and anti-party movements to us, we succeed because we are together with stronger.
Jenette Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendez, Karen B, Zanne Monney are among some of the activities performed in New York a year-long event, which will be held by Deborah-Lil Fernes Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use marine forces to reduce the energy export of Russia - Minister of Internal Affairs
"In case of need" Washington can apply its marine forces to promote Russian energy, hit the market, including the United States Minister of Internal Affairs, Ray Zinc, as a deployment of Washington travelmer.
Zenke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria – in particular, where it operates by invitation of legitimate government – is a blanket to study new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason for their stay in the Middle East is that they want to fight with energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, in the south of Europe,” he said.
And, with official data, there are ways and means to cope with it.
“The United States of America has the ability to ensure that we are open by sea and if necessary, we will pay the blockade to ensure that their energy will not be in the market,” he said.
Zinc addressed participants of the event who hosted the connection to consumer energy, the non-commercial group, which presents themselves as the "energy user's voice" in the USA.
He went to the Washington approach to Russia and Iran, and he said they were actually the same.
“The economic option for Russia and Iran, is a minimum of use and change of fuel leverage,” he said, “that Russia is “with one specialty,” whose economy depends on the milling fuel.
The news comes that the Trump administration aimed to increase its liquid gas export in Europe and change Russia, a much cheaper option for European users.
For this, representatives of the Trump Administration, including US President Donald Trump, try to convince Germany to refuse the #Red Strim 2 millennial project, which said by Trump, was an action of Berlin Moscow’s “word”.
Moscow repeatedly noted that 11 billion Nord Strim 2 miles, which is designed to double existing pipeline volume, up to 110 billion cubic meters, clean economic projects.
Cream believes that Washington’s heartfelt opposition towards the project is simply caused by economic reasons and is an example of a unfair competition.
“I believe we share the opinion that energy can not be allowed to carry pressure and that customers should choose suppliers,” said Russian Minister Alexander Novak, in Moscow with the Minister of Energy, Rick Peri in September.
The US position led to dissatisfaction from Germany, which confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany’s leading organization in industry, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called the US, to destroy the EU energypolicy and mutual agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a great problem when the third state goes into our energy supply,” said the German Chairman of the Federation of Industry (BDI), Diter KMPF, Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkellel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin after the last meeting between Vladimir Putin.

Treck Peilin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq, after the arrival of September.
He was arrested and taken away from the incident of domestic violence on Monday night

18 states, Colombian district supports new law on shelter
The fourteen states and the Columbia District supports a legal challenge towards the new US policy that does not give shelter to victims of gang or family violence.
On Friday, in Washington, 18 states and the Columbia District, the representatives of the USA and the United States have given a summary of the Court-Georgia to support shelter seekers, lead to what policy, reported the NBC News.
The full name of the claimer against Grace Sessin, which the American Civil Liberty Union presented against Federal Policy in August, has not been shown.
He said that his partner "and his violent gang member," he insulted him, but the US official officials refused him to request shelter on July 20, 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
State Representatives who support Grace, describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of applicants for the United States shelter, as these nations stand before gangs and domestic violence.
The U.S. New Asylum Policy has canceled the 2014 decision of the Agricultural Council of Georgia, which allowed irresistible immigrants to treat domestic violence and get shelter.
President of the Columbia District, Karl Russell said that the new Policy “will be insured for decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Perfect law requires that all shelter requests rely on specific facts and request circumstances, and this restriction violates this principle,” said Court-Georgia.
Representatives say that politics that prevent immigrants from entering the US policy, they say they are becoming more entrepreneurs, and they are "supporting us with the necessary work force."
The Representative Gepher Sessin ordered the judges of immigration in June to no longer take refuge for the victims of domestic and gang violence.
“The shelter is available for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of membership of a particular social group or political views,” SSSSN said on June 11, during policy anonymity.
Shelter has never been to reduce all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- which people are going to stop every day around the world.
A self-sacrificing attempt to rescue refugees in Palu, where the number of killed in the search race increases twice
For survival, the situation was becoming increasingly tense.
"It's very tension," said a 35-year-old mother in Rama Kusuma, before she was comforted by her so-called child in the center of the evacuation of the city of Pavlo.
“Every minute, the emergency vehicles flow the bodies of the bodies every minute.
Pure water is insufficient."
The population returns to their houses, refrigerating property in the water, trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals who were injured by 7.5 magnets were moved.
Some injured, including Dviv Hars, who has a waist and shoulder fracture, rested outside the Pavus Military Hospital, where patients were treated out of the hospital because of strong efferces.
The eyes are filled with tears when he again began to jump on the sensations when the intense earthquake broke the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, where his wife and daughter lived with him.
"It wasn't time to get rid of us.
I put in the walls of the wall, I think,"he said Harry Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city, in the wedding.
"I learned how my wife asked for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they're safe."
US Embassy accused China of ‘propagand Advertising’
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published four-page advertisements, where the US every day requests the common benefits of the US-China trade, the US Ambassador in China was accused of spreading the propagandation through the American press.
The U.S. President Donald Trump addressed Chaina Dali’s price supplement at Des Moines Register - Iowa State’s Top Selling newspaper - after the fact of the crime in China, while trying to interfere with the U.S. 6 November Congress elections, China rejects.
The Trump was accused that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections, which made it clear what the US representatives told Roiters became a new phase of campaigning in Washington to pressure China.
While it is normal to place ads by foreign governments in order to promote trade, now Beijing and Washington are in the Escalation of Trade War, where they raise tariffs on each other’s imported bill.
China’s response tariffs were created at the beginning of the trading war to bring a blow to the United States for exporters, such as Iowa, who supports the Republican Party of the Trump, say Chinese and American experts.
Terri Bronstead, China US Ambassador and Iowa former long governor, the main exporter of agriculture goods in China, says Beijing has affected American employees, farmers and businessmen.
Brandder at Des Moines Register on Monday, he wrote that China is now “foreigning this violence with the spread of propagand in our free press.”
“In the distribution of Propaganda, the Chinese government enjoys a warm and free word with a des Moines Register,” writes Brand.
“In contrast, here, in Beijing Street, you will find a limited understanding and you will not find a real different opinion, which can be found in China’s problematic economy tractor, which shows that media is under a heavy creator of the Chinese Communist Party,” he writes.
He added, "One of the most famous newspapers in China has refused to publish" his article, but he didn't say that the newspaper.
Cavano's failure, the republics are foreign before the intermediates of the female voters, warn us of analytics
As long as the republics of high-rise are in expectation mode and protect the candidates of the highest court of Brut Cavano, in front of several charges of sexual assault, analytics warned that during intermediate elections, they will receive a negative result, especially from women.
The emotions around it were extremely high, and most of the republics have already registered yo, and they feel they want to move forward to the voting.
In this regard, it is impossible to take the opinion back,” said Grant Riher, professor of political science at the University of Sirakus, Professor of the University of Sirakus, in the Saturday article.
Ryher said that he suspects that Senator Jack Fluic (Arazonna) in the last minute to investigate the federal bureau, it will be enough to calm down the voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget neither tomorrow nor November,” said Karlin Jean-Pier, head of the Progressive Group MoveOn Advisor and the National Speaker on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, during the demonstration at the Senate Hall, the participants of the act "November come!" when the republicans who control the Irdiian committee decided to take a stand against the Caucasus appointment, regardless of the doc. Christine Blaise Ford, reported Mic.
“The zeal and motivation of the Democrats will be very high,” said the news site St. Louis Rossenberg, a non-party political analyst.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can be higher, especially in the suburbs of women and young voters, from 18 to 29 years, despite the fact that the president does not like it, not often participate in elections."
Even before the public of the Ford, which reflects its accusations on the sexual attack, against the highest court candidate, analysts suggest that this will result in a negative result if the republics take the lead in evidence.
“This became a silly disorder for the Republicans,” said Michael Style, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the last week, NBC News reported.
“The job is not only in the polling, or to give the final sound, or to ask whether the Caucasus seat is also about how the Republicans followed it and how they treated it,” G. Seil, director of the US priorities, a group that helps to choose democracy, defined the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat open to someone who has to trust the Ford and Caucasus displays, and a little more support this latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are definitely or probably believes in Ford Displays when 35 states that they definitely or perhaps believe in Caucasus.
Additionally, 38 percent claim that Caucasus is likely or will surely be disappointed when it is only 30 percent of the same forum.
After the pressure from fluii, the Federal Bureau is currently looking for a Ford, as well as other other complaints, Deborah Ramyre's accusations, reported by Gudauri.
Ford gave him a statement on the previous week, before the Senate Legal Committee of the Senate, that Caavano was forced to leave him when he was 17 years old.
Ramyr says that the candidate of the Supreme Court showed him a genital body when they were in a party, during the years of teaching at the University of Iele in the 1980s.
World Network Inventor plans to create a new internet in order to swallow the guila and fesbrush
Tim Berners, a world-inventor of the world network, launches a new project that will resist Facebook, Amazon and Gugge.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is the company that builds the open platform of Berners-L. Solid.
Solid users allow users to choose where their data will be stored and what it is right for people to access any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the Inrupt purpose of Inrupt is “the world's lordship.”
"We have to do this now," he said about the beginning.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to give their own "personal online data storage", or POD.
This may include contact lists, list of cases, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and simultaneously.
What has a unique personal online data cover, is that the whole customer depends on whom information will be accessed.
The company calls it “the first authority through the data”.
According to the Director John Bryus, the idea of Inrupt is to promote resources, processes and relevant skills to promote Solid become available for everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Liss, Brussels, IBM-based security platform, several employees of the IBM, with whom the contract was signed to work on the project, and the association of volunteers.
Since this week, technology developers can create their own decentralized applications, through the tools placed on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team would not talk about "Fissubux and Google about whether they will make a full change, where all their business models will be fully self-sufficient in one day.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In the article on the Sabbath, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect integrity and quality of Solid is a new network.”
In 1994, Berners-Leim made the Internet transformation when he established the World Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last months, Berners-Le was a influential voice in the debates of network neutrality.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners will be the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this era of this network," added Berners-Lim.
Bernard Vani: Celebrated by a priest in the 1 World War I by Victoria Cross
In the first World War of England, the only clergy of the Church of England, as a fighter of Victoria, was marked in his native city, after 100 years.
Pokonik-Leittenist, the priest Bernard Wan won award on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellongliz and Lekut.
However, he killed Snaper after four days and never understood that he received the highest military honor.
On Saturday, on Pardad, his two grandsons erected a memorable stone in Rashden in Northampton.
One of his grandsons, Michael Wan, noted that it was “a symbolic” that the stone was held at the top of his babour's reward for 100 years.
According to the London newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Pokonik-Littenant Vani was led by his Battalion along the San Kentine Channel "as a heavy fire under a very thick tanissa and artillery and bullets."
Then he broke up with the fire line and "a great manly" led the line towards the artiller and said three of them.
Pokonik-Littenant van killed German snaper on October 4, 1918 - exactly one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72-year-old, said that his behavior was "what I couldn't do, but what's humble."
He and his brother, Doct. James Wan also played a crown, which led to the Imperial Youth band of Brindisi.
Michael Vanne said that he "he feels very appreciated, because he participates in parliament" and added "the courage of a real hero is seen with the support of a lot of people."
Mixed fighting art fans spent night to watch Bellator 206, instead of choosing Goch Pepa
Imagine the whole time you put it out to try Bellator 206 for 206, and you couldn't be able to test the main event.
San Jose scored 13 battles, including six main cards, and was displayed directly in the United Kingdom, on the 5 channel.
At 6 p.m., after Gerard Musas and Rori Mcdonald were prepared to meet each other, the audiences of the United Kingdom were amazed when the broadcasting was transferred to Goch Peppa.
Some of the heartless, after they spent all night specially for this night.
One fan switching to the customer's cartoon, described as "something sick jokes."
"This is the state regulation that this transmission was inappropriate at 6 pm, so they had to switch to the kindergarten "Director Schwarz, Bellator Marketing and Communications Head Vice President when he was asked about the transfer.
"Gog Pepa," Yes."
Bellator President, Scott Cocker said they work on his graphics to take into account the future of the United Kingdom watchers.
"I think when I think about repeats, I think maybe we might think something," said a cocker.
"But there's six hours in the morning, on Sunday, and we can't work on it until our time is Sunday, and their time will not be Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me when you changed, there were many texts going ahead and none of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't that, it was the government's case.
I promise, then it won't be repeated.
We have five battles instead of six -- as we do normally -- we tried to show us more about fans, and we just got extra.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Deli, due to sexual orientation, felt "inhumanly"
Olympian interministry Tom Deli says that he grew up in the feeling of the needy, because of his sexual orientation of others, but this gave him motivation to become successful.
24-year-old says he couldn't understand until he went to the secondary school, where "all is not like me."
For the first time, talking about the Desert Island Discs, leading Lauren Lavern, he said that he was talking about the right of gays to help others “to give me hope.”
He also said that since he became a parent, he is less interested in winning the Olympics.
The long show regulatory leading, Kirt Jangma, was released for a few months due to illness.
He was revealed in the first program of Lavern, that when he grew up, he felt “sufficiently” about others, because "he wasn't socially accepted when boys and girls would love you."
He said, "To the day, the sensations I felt less and differently than others, I was real who gave me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he did not give up hope when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The Medaloman of the Orzzz Olympics became a part of the LGBT campaign and used its appearance to play this year’s community in Australia to promote discrimination in the presence of more countries.
He said that he removed the voice because he found himself lucky to live openly without being an impetusing and wanted to give others "Immedi".
The World Samgori Champion said that a man loved me - the cinema creator of the U.S. Dan Len Blake, who met me in 2013, "I had to wait for the end."
Deil married with Ossetian, who is older than 20 years old, last year, but he said that age difference has never been a problem.
"When you've gone so far at your age," he was 14 years old at the first Olympic Olympics, and his father died three years later, he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who was similar to that of you.
The couple became their son’s parents in June, which was named Robert Ray Blake-Dece, and Dail says that his “full values” have changed.
"If you've been reading this year, the only thing I wanted was to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the medal of Olympic gold.
My gold medal Robia."
Her father's name is Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after brain cancer.
Deily said that his father didn't get the fact that he had to die and one last thing he asked if he had tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to stay in front of the lines.
"I couldn't tell him "You can't be in the first row, Father." He said.
“I gave her hand when she stopped breathing and it was not happened until she really stopped breathing and did not die, I finally did not realize that she was not immortal,” she said.
The following year, Deli won Yasparasia at the 2012 Olympics and Bronze.
"I knew that this is what I dreamed of all my life -- to throw my own fans in front of the Olympics, there was no better feeling about it," he said.
This also inspires to choose your first song - Proud by Heather Small, which led to the participation of the Olympics, and is still a structurer.
Desert Island Discs will be BBC radio on 4 weeks, 11:15.
Mikheilson was on Saturday at Rider Cup Application
The American film Micheelson will take a record on the 47th match on Rider's cup, but he must return the form to him as a stage of disaster.
Miqelson, who will participate in the two-year event in the 12th anniversary of the two-year event, took the application to the Captain Jim Shevak in the Saturday Forbilisi and Form.
Instead of being in the center of action, as he was often in the United States, five-day winners of fivegzas took their own day between being a bird and working on his game hoping to correct what he is suffering.
Never, the most correct driver, even in his career peak, is not ideal for Le Golf Nasionali course, for a long and rough continuous hit.
And if the course itself is not enough, Micheelson, on the 9th match of the week, is opposed to the exact British Open First Champion of Franchesco Molinar, which is a new-modeled volume with Flytwood to win four matches this week.
If the Americans start with four points below, the matches of 12 singles will start at the beginning of the hot start, the match of Michelson will be absolutely important.
She expressed confidence in her man, not that she could say much more.
"He's completely aware of the role that he's going to play today, he's on my shoulder, and he's on my arm, and he told me he's going to be ready tomorrow."
"It's very self-confidence.
He's in the hall of glory, and he's a lot of me with these teams in the past and this week.
I probably couldn't imagine it would play two matches.
I've done more, but that's what I've done, and that's the way I thought we should go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone."
On Sunday, Miqelson will attend the record of the most conducted matches on Nik Paldo, Reder Cup.
It can be noted at the end of the Rider Cup career, which never corresponds to the heights of its individual recordings.
Mikheelson has 18 profits, 20 failures and seven half, although he said that his presence brought some unsupported sensations.
"It's funny, it's a mirror, it's a language, she loves people jokes, and she's a good type that I need to be in your team," she explained.
"I think the young players joined him, as well as this week, which was a good sight.
It offers much more than just a game."
The European Captain Thomas Born knows that a great difference can soon be destroyed
Thomas Bren, a European captain, knows that being ahead of the last day at Rider’s Cup can easily happen as an uncomfortable race.
Denis had a debut on Valderam in 1997, on the side of Steve Balesteros, had five points of advantage for Americans, but the final line was closer to the minimum difference, won what 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a great difference on Valderam, and we had a great difference in Brooklyn, where we've been defeated, and Valderam, where we won, but only," Biohrer said, after the 5-3 victory of the 2018, took advantage of 10-6 Le Golf Nasion.
So history shows me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
Play tomorrow in full-time.
Get up and do everything you need.
It doesn't end until the points are written on the dashboard.
We have a goal, and that's what we're trying to win a bowl, and that's our focus.
I've been saying that I'm going to double the 12 players who are on our side, but we know what stands on the other side - the largest players of the world."
He was satisfied with how his players played on the game of tension golf, he added: "I couldn't imagine that.
We're waiting for another beast tomorrow.
We're waiting for individual studies tomorrow, and that's a different thing.
It's a cool feeling when you go there with a partner when everything goes fine, but when you go alone, then you check fully as a golf player.
This is the message you need to take before players, show your maximum tomorrow.
Now, you have your partner back and he has to go out and also reveal his maximum."
Unlike biorine, the opposite side is waiting for Jim Shelf to play with his players that they are individually better playing than pairs, exceptionally Jordan Spite and Jazzin Thomas, who took three points from four.
The sheet itself was both at the end of this previous day's big spins, there was a part of the winner team in Brooklyn, before it was defeated, when Europe gained "the wonders of medyna."
"I remember every circulating word from there," he responded when he asked how the captain addressed Ben Crensoum in 1999 when he led his players in the last day.
"We have 12 important matches, but you want to take such a quick start as you see in Brooklyn as you see in the media.
When this impetus takes one direction, it's a huge pressure on those middle matches.
We made our composition in accordance with our composition, and we put our boys out as fashionable as we felt, you know, we're trying to make a certain magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to resist and meet Rori Macelro's main match, Paul Kesi, Jattin Rose, John Rem, Tom Flewwood and Jan Pulter with other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of these guys, because I think it's all the way," Biorn said when choosing his single song.
Receiving a new warship in Germany once again
The German fleet had to be adopted in 2014 in order to replace the warships of the old cold war period, but it cannot be taken up until at least in the next year, due to defective systems and growing costs, the local media reported.
“Rheinland-Pfalz,” a leading aircraft of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of Friedrichs was delayed until the first half of 2019 as the newspaper Die Zeit quotes the words of military representative.
The ship was to join the Float in 2014, but after the problem-related issue, the issue was completed by the end of this ambitious project.
Four pieces of Baden-Wuerttemberg’s class vessel, which was ordered in 2007, must be a substitute for aging Bremen-class Freegates.
It is clear that they will have a strong submerge, a gastrointestinal and anti-war racks, as well as some stick technologies, such as radar reduction, infrared and acoustic technologies.
Other important features are long storage periods – it should be possible to place new fries away from home port for two years.
However, constant delays mean that the latest fighting ships – which is calculated to strengthen Germany’s marine force – will be deprecated when they engage in work, notes Die Zeit.
Avenue F125 Friedgat was treated in the last year's titles, when the German fleet officially rejected the ship receiving and returned it to Blohm & Voss ship factory in Hamburg.
This was the first case when the German Float ship builder returned to the ship after its departure.
The reason for returning back is less known, but German media pointed out a number of important "programming and hardware effects" that would make the fighting look useless if it was run in its fight mission.
The software defect was particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class has a crew of 120 sailers – only half of the old Bremen class’s personal composition.
It also turned out that the ship is dramaticly excess weight, which reduces its performance and blocks the possibility to add improvements in the future.
Thousands of tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" will be twice heavy than similar class ships that Germany used in the Second World War.
In addition to the problematic equipment, the price of the full project is the involvement of the crew – there is another issue.
As they say, it was amazingly reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) – from 2.2 billion euros.
The following problems of the latest Frequency are exceptionally important in the background of the last warning that the strength of the German fleet decreases.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peters Bartson, Chairman of the German Parliament Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet was actually “releases from the ability to lay down ships.”
The representative claims that the problem has been digested over time, since the old ships have been removed from the boat, but the replacement ships have not been sold.
He said that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class Friedrich could not join the Float.
National Trust Protection Protects the Secret Life of the Doomsday
The new research implemented, in the mountains of Scotland, aims to figure out how the fences use landscapes for hunting food.
They hope that discoveries will shed light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help us to overcome the activities of the future nature.
The Scottish National Trust Science Research tracks the usual and small vomiting as well as the brown large-scale vomiting and vomiting, invervee gardens, in the West Ross.
Special recorders will be installed along the main logins along the property to control the fence activities during the season.
NHS employees and volunteers also produce moving observations, using hand detectors.
Analysis of all the recordings by experts will determine the frequency of the vomiting and which type does this.
Then consists of habitite map and account to create a detailed picture of their behavior across the landscape.
Rob დევar, the Director of the National Trust in Scotland, hopes that the results will reveal, which areas of the habilet are the most important vomiting and how they will use each species.
This information will allow you to determine the advantages of the hambilet management work, such as creating steroids how to maintain lead places with vomiting and other, related species.
The popularity of the fences in Scotland and the United Kingdom has significantly decreased during the past century.
They are threatened by the construction and development works that affect their chest and destroys the habitat.
Wind turbines and elastics also contain risk, as well as adhesive paper and some chemical products of construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Dogs are actually not cracks.
However, because of their night hunt habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a victim.
They use sophisticated ecolociation techniques to determine the location and obstacles of insects on their flight path.
The National Trust of Scotland, responsible for more than 270 historical garbage, 38 important gardens and over 76,000 hectares across the country, is very serious.
The match has ten trained experts who regularly perform studies, perform inspections, and sometimes rescue works.
The organization also organized the territory of the Protected Area of Scotland for the first and only fences, on the Trivis land, in the Damper-endgalovi, which is the house of Tess from the face of Scotland.
The land manager, David Thomaspson says that the land is the ideal area for them.
"Here, in the triva, we have a big area for vomiting," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees a lot of good habilet.
But there are a lot of things we don't yet know about the pits, so the works we're doing here, and the other directions will help us to understand more about what they need to build."
It emphasizes the importance of inspection of vomiting, on ownerships before the protection of the work, as an incomprehensible destruction of a single home broom can kill up to 400 females and young people, which will likely cause total destruction of local population.
Dogs are protected and kill them, pressure, or anxiety, or destruction of their chest is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferel, a Scottish officer of the Trust of the Dog Protection of the Scottish Officer, the community is pleased to help them.
He said, "We have to learn a lot about our vomiting and our species, we just don't know how they live."
Robertd was released from rape accusations, and lawyers complain of German magazine
Crystalian Ronalddad called the protests against him "fast news," says that people "have to be self-sacrificing" using his name.
His lawyers are going to complain about the German news magazine, Der Spiegel, which has published accusations.
Portugal and Yuventus attacker are charged in the American woman's rape named Keitriin Mayorga, at Las Vegas Hotel in 2009.
It also happens to him to pay 375,000 dollars in order not to vote on the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Instagram, in the video of Tavv 142 medals, a few hours after the accusations were published, the 33-year-old Rolfndu called the accusations of "Black News".
"No, no, no, no.
What you said today is a fake news," says a gold ball in front of a five-distance winner camera.
"They need to advertise their name using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be well-known with my name, but this is part of their case.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine,” added the player with a smile.
The lawyers of Ronalddu are preparing for the defendant of Der Spiegel against the Der Spiegel, who called them “the unlimited report on disputes based on personal life,” reported Rotters.
Lawyer Christine Shertz says that the player’s compensation requires “for moral harm, in accordance with the appropriate amount of violation of the severity, which may be one of the most serious violations of the rights of personal life in recent years.”
According to the incident occurred in June 2009, Palms Hot and Las Vegas Casino.
After the meeting in the night club, Ronald and I found it back to the player's room, where he was accused of being accused of being charged by an initially, filled with sheets, in the Klark District Court in Nevada.
Iowa says that after the incident, Ronda went to the knees and told him that he was "99 percent" of the good boy, which would betray "one percent."
According to the documents, Ronalddo recognizes that the couple had sex, but it was in agreement.
It also says that he went to the police and showed him the images of his trams, but then agreed to solve the dispute without the court, because he felt “the fear of anger” and was afraid to become “inseparable.”
The 34-year-old says that he is now trying to overcome the dispute, because he is still traumatized from the incident.
Rolled was the Manchester from UNESCO to Madrid on the way to move to Madrid’s Real, when accused of attacking, and in this summer it was transferred to the Italian giant Yuve, with a 100 million euro agreement.
Brexit: Loss of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom.
Due to the loss of the status of the world leader in the vehicles of the United Kingdom, Grant Clark announces the business Secretary Grigol, after Brexit.
He added that the fact that Toyota UK told BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, this will result in a temporary delay in the production of production in Burston.
“We need a deal,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of border delays, in case of infringing the transaction, is related to the working areas of the Brexit.
Burston Plant (which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis, has released about 150,000 vehicles in the previous year, and their 90% have been exported to other EU countries.
“I think if the UK will come to the EU and at the end of March, we will see the termination of production in our factory,” said Toyota Manager Marvin Kuku.
The other vehicle manufacturers of the United Kingdom are afraid to leave the EU without agreement with the Transaban Trade Implementation, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its minifrastructure in Oxford after one month of Brexit.
The main issue relating to the views of vehicle manufacturers is the risk of creating a delivery chain in case of infringing Brexit transactions.
The production line of Toyota is operated on the basis of the so-called “Trolity”, where spare parts are delivered every 37 minutes for vehicles from EU and United Kingdom suppliers.
If the United Kingdom leaves without the EU deal on 29 March, the above may lead to violations on the border, which will lead to inconveniences and deficits of parts in the industry.
Toyota would not be able to stop the inventory for more than a day in its derbiser factory, with the company’s statement, and therefore the production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa Mei Checherts Plan on Future Relations with the EU "It is precisely designed for preventing such tests on the border."
“We need to get this deal. We want to get the best deal that will give us the opportunity, as I already said, to achieve success at this stage, and also to make this opportunity in the future,” says BBC Radio 4 today's program.
Based on the evidence received from other manufacturers of Toyota, we definitely need to continue doing the most successful activities of delivery networks.
Toyota did not make a comment during the period of the production, but warned that if it lasts for a long time, this will result in reducing the competitiveness of the factory and decrease the jobs at the end.
Peter Turvari, who worked on the Burnaton object for 24 years and is the head of the professional union in the factory, says that his members are very bored with this fact. “In my experience, it is already impossible to restore a lost job.
The government speaker said: “We have presented accurate and rational plan for our future relationships with the EU.”
By application of the White House, the Tram Meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again
According to the Sunday report, Donald Trump's high ranking meeting with the Deputy Minister of Justice, Rod Rozenshstein “can be delayed for the next week” because the struggle with the candidates of the Supreme Court is still continuing
Rozenshstein is looking at the work of a Special Defender Robert Muller, who seeks to issue the involvement of the Russian elections, links between traffic assistance and Russia, and the potential changes of the legislation by the President.
Whether the trump is the Deputy Minister of Justice and is a threat to the independence of the Multier, this gossip exceeds Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, during the interview with New York Time, Rosenstein said that he discussed the use of hearing aids in talking with the trump, and the possibility of installation of the President based on the 25th corrections.
Rozenstein refused to report this account (report).
On the last Monday, he arrived at the white home, and the account was planning to move.
So, meeting with a trump, which was held in the United Nations in New York, was appointed on Wednesday
Trump said he did not want to conflict with Rosenstein, but since then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid conflict with the Senate Legal Committee, which at that time listened to Kavnafi and one of the women, Cristin Blaise Ford on his sexual crimes.
On Friday, the trump issued an order to conduct a one-week investigation against the KGB, and then switched to the legislative session of the Senate.
On Sunday, the premium of Trump Sara Sanders was at Fox News.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: “The exact date is not yet set, the note may be prescribed this week, my opinion is to take the meeting into consideration about the current issues of the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and we're sure to know the news of media.
A few reporters are going to complain about evidence: the Sander has not been carried out by the Briefing in the White House after September 10.
The host was interested in the reason for this.
As he said, the failure of diamonds is not associated with the “act” of teletraporters, but he also added: “I agree that this “act” is designed to achieve a special effect.”
Later, he said that direct connection between traffic and media will grow.
“President conducts more Q&A sessions than its predecessor presidents,” added the respondent, and without the quote of evidence, adding: “We have looked at them for a rally.”
According to Sandders, the diamonds will be held in the future, but “If the press has a chance to directly ask the President of the United States, this is much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do a lot, and as you can see in the last few weeks, a great job has been done, and we also plan to conduct diamonds, where you will be given the opportunity to speak directly to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly listens to questions when leaving a white house, or participates in open sessions and high rating press conferences.
Special press conferences are rarely held.
This week in New York, the President is likely to demonstrate why the ideas are free to generate and show the original image in front of the reporters.

So I want to tell you again, and how I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Collegians from the EU and other regions share a very valuable experience and knowledge that enhances and improves health care areas, and the benefits are beneficial for patients and society.
Scotland, in fact, is your homeland, and we want you to stay here."

At this stage, new policy will be processed after Boris Johnson requested to reduce the grant fee in order to young people can purchase their first housing.
It hurts the large developer companies to maintain the price of high-quality prices, and calls on the lady May to cancel the quos on affordable housing.
Mr. Corbin made a statement on important reforms of the proposed real estate sector reforms, their hire control and the end of major settlements.
It also has a purpose to give consultations (advisors) more authority for building new houses.
Mrs. Mey said, "In the previous year, I've tried to take my entire premiere to the British Dream, and life will be better for the next generations.
And that means that we will respond to the faults of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it will not be right if we make a real estate purchase procedures for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, or foreign companies, who work in the UK residences.
Buying a house for many people stays unauthorized dream, and a deployment of night is a reality under the open sky."

We will use this opportunity only to manage the club's success."
The predecessors of Ross in Sanderland were a Dick lawyer, David Wind, Three Albards, Martin Oneli, Roy Kenya, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canyo.
The former of Alloa Athletic claims that he is not flowering in a discomfort when working with such famous faces in a big club, and he has previously refused to initiate Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success of me at this moment is due to the desire to return this club to the Prime League?"
If we look at the structure and infrastructure of this coupon, no doubt its place is in the prime League,” he says.

It's strange, but I feel good, I get rational income, and I reached some heights.
But the game is difficult.
You have to overcome lots of challenges for a week.
I'm fighting this stress and pressure that is characteristic of my activities, but I still think I'm not going to change my management.

The summer hot mask increased the income of British pabs, but it was heavy for restaurant networks.
The sales in the pabe and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July – but incoming restaurants decreased 4.8 percent according to the calculations conducted.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant who conducted this calculation, says: “The built-in warm weather and the world’s sudden World Cup would have been involved in the existence of the same indicators in July, which, when the revenue of clubs increased by 28 percent, while restaurants saw a greater loss.
In June, 1.8 percent of restaurant sales decreased in July.
Trading trader packages and bars have divided their positions into proportional variations of restaurants.
For food trader pabs have increased due to heat, but not too serious, compared to restaurant operators.

When the sales of drinks in packages and bars increased by 6.6 percent per month, food products were reduced to three percent.”
RSM's tourism analytics said: these results continue to be the trend set by the end of April.
The weather and the impact of the main social or sports events are important factors regarding sales in the inner market.
It is no doubt that the groups of restaurants will continue to fight because their sales are reduced by 4.8 percent per year, which is especially painful on the background of the current tax transfer.
The long hot summer is not a good time for food products for traders operators and time shows whether the expected moderate temperature in August is the basis of the absorption.

Gymboo company shared its opinion on the internet with ad that compares to breastfeeding mothers with cows
To celebrate the new start, it is said that it should be “the first chum in the world with chest pump”, the consumer technology company Elvie released a promotional video in the style of music that is used to show freedom, which gives a new pump to nursing mothers.
The four real mom who dances like the cows in the boutique, the song background, which includes the following words: "Yes, I'm Milk myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice it, these are not jeans, these are my breasts."
The team continues: "I'm saying, I'm saying, I'm going to do this with children, I'm saying, I'm telling you, I'm eating my ladies."
However, ads published on the company Facebook page led to confrontation online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reaction from the viewer, and many have said that it is clear about the layer of the dairy industry’s “inflammatory”.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows in this product advertising.
As a testimony, they have to get pregnant and get rid of milk in order to separate the milk, except for their children to repeat a few days after visiting it, - writes one
Elvie chest pump is insufficiently in the voltage lift (Elvie/mom)
Another comment was made: "We've been traumatized by both mother and child.
But why don't they use their chest pump to advertise, for those who show a child?"
Someone added, "Assistant advertisement."
Others defended the advertisement. One woman admits that she showed her song "intimatively".
"I think this is a genius idea.
I was going to be one of the breastfeeding.
I'd feel like a real cow.
Advertisement is a bit crazy, but I got it like it was.
This is a genius product,” writes one.
Another comment: "This is a fun advertisement, designed for mothers who burn milk (in their jobs or toilets) and feel like cows."
It's not ads that stocks or judge the milk industry."
At the end of the video, it shows that women are danced in the populous pumps.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that most women who are burning say they feel like cows.
And Elvie's pump is completely sound, there are no wires or pipes and indirectly flows into the elevator, which allows women to freely move, grab their hands, and even get out of the bus.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD mother makes comments: "Elvie pump is so revolutionary product that she deserves to play and provocative launch.
In the parallel between self-discipline and entrepreneurs, we wanted to sell milk from breastfeeding, and all its problems went into the center of attention, in which entertainment and interesting ways demonstrate an incredible freedom of feeling, which gives a new pump.
This is not the first case when Elvie's pump hit the tops of the news
During the London Fashion Week, two children's mother appeared on the podium designer Martha Ikubowski when using the product.
Hundreds of migrants moved to the camp of the tents in Texas
The number of busy migrants increased dramatically, although the crossing of monthly borders remained relatively unchanged, partially because the traffic administration introduced a strict rhetoric and policy that made it difficult to place children with sponsors
Traditionally, most sponsors were self-sufficient immigrants who were afraid to risk their stay in their country to move forward to the request of a child.
The risk has grown in June when the Federal Government announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their family had to submit fingerprints and their data were transferred to the immigration bodies.
Last week, Matt Albinis, Immigration and customs execution, the convention confirmed that the agency has forgiven tens of people who have requested sponsorship of non-patient minorities.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the prisoners had no previously committed crimes.
“about 80 percent of those who are members of sponsors or sponsors, are illegal in the country, and their significant part is criminal residents.
So we continue to endure these people," said Mr. Albins.
In order to accelerate the process of children, new rules were presented by officials, according to which some of them should be submitted to the court within one month after their arrest, and not after 60 days, which was provided according to the previous standards of shelter workers.
Many will be shown through the video conference, not personally, in order to reveal their legal status to the owner of immigration.
The one who is not subject to the help is urgently exported.
According to the report of shelter workers and reports, which has emerged over the last months from the system, the longer the children remain in custody, the greater the likelihood that they become anxious or depressed, which can cause violent manifestations or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that these problems have been strengthened in larger institutions, such as Tornol, where the signs of the child’s struggle are more ignored than its measurement.
They were also accused that without giving enough time and comfort to children without giving enough time and friends, transfering their tents to the city of their tents, it can make it easier for the trauma that most of them have been fighting.
Syria is commanding the U.S., France and Turkey’s "Occupational Forces" immediately to pull their troops.
Wald Al-Malem, Minister of Foreign Affairs, also called for Syrian refugees to return, despite the fact that the country's war has continued for eight years

He said that Damascus would continue to “in this holy battle until he will not release the entire Syrian area of Syria” from terrorist groups and “every illegal alien existence.”
In the United States, there are about 22,000 militaryes in Syria, which are mainly prepared and taught by both Kutaisi and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Basar al-Aasa.
France has over 1000 soldiers in the land of war.
As for the refugees, Mulem said that their return terms were good and he blamed the "some West Country", which "renownational fear" which prompted refugees to return to the country
“We call for international community and humanitarian organizations to promote their return,” he said.
"They're politicalizing what should be just a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the EU warn that Syria will not receive help for recovery until the political agreement of the end of the war between Asad and opposition.
UN Diplomatists claim that the recent agreement on creation of buffer zones between Russia and Turkey, in the last major rebel forces of Idlibian, create the opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkal Agreement canceled the Russian agreement, a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces, where three million people live.
However, Mumale emphasized that the agreement had a "sanctual dates" and expressed hope that military actions would be directed against the ghettos, including the fighters related to Al-Gaida, who would be “removed.”
The United Nations representative Shatana de Mestia hopes to invite the first meeting of the new committee in which the representatives of the Government and opposition will develop the following constitution of Syria to open the way of war and elections.
The municipality determined the conditions of participation in the Syrian government in the committee and stated that the Commission’s activities should be limited to the discussion of the articles of the “Current Constitution” and warned from the involvement.
Why the Trump wins the second term
With this logic, Mr. Trump will win a new election in 2020, if as many liberal viewers hope, impecy and scandal will not end its presidentship at the same time.
What's going to be, without all doubt, "the most dramatic final of the presidentiality!"
There are no signs of fatigue of the viewer at this moment.
Since 2014, Prague-Time ratings have doubled 1.05 million and increased nearly three times on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen’s data, there is an average of 2.4 million Praim-Time viewers on Fox News, which has 1.7 million compared to 4 years ago, and MSNBC "Rechell Medous Show" has exceeded 3.5 million in the ranking of cable channels.
"This is the fire for which people are drowning, because it's not what we understand." - says Nill Ber, the director of the ABC drama director, "Last Candidate", the Secretary of the Cabinet, which happens after the President's attack, which destroys the capital.

Of course, in addition to the rest of the TV, the story from Washington can determine the future of Ros W. W... W., whether it is possible to unite immigrant families and the health of global economy.

Beyond the money, it increased the strict intermediate elections of the Revolution House.
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania suffers the flow of money, thanks to the reconstruction of the electoral districts, which took two positions to fight for the same place.
This newly renovated Sakrebulo Pitsburg district is surrounded by a member of the Democracy Chamber of Representatives, Conor Lemb – who won the second round in the special elections last spring.
The Lamp goes against another positioning person, the Republican Keteu, which currently represents the 12th Olympics of the old Pennsylvania, which is partly matching the new 17th
Maps have been rebuilt when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court approved that the old Rayons were formed in favor of the Republicans.
On the 17th of the new 17th Tururri led to the reduction of funding of the campaign of the Party Financial Department, the Democratic Congress Commission (DCC) and the Committee of the Republicans (NRCC) campaign.
Lemb became famous in Pennsylvania, in March after a narrow victory in a broad election, in the 18th district of Pennsylvania
This place was held for decades, and President Donald Trump won 20 points.
Political experts gave a slight advantage of democracy.
The United States has canceled the fine for El Salvador due to the support of the United States
Diplomas noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing as a minor gift from Washington
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with the President Juan Karlo Varella in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama before the partners announced the management team of the Trump organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to secure the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Republic of Dominica and Panama, “The Last Decision on the Recognition of Taiwan’s Recognition”, said the Department of Speaker Hesper Navert at the beginning of this month.
But the fines were only provided for El Salvador, who received 140 million USD with the help of USD in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
Suggested fines, which include reducing financial aid and target visa restrictions, will be painful for Central America countries and its unemployment and high level of murder
Local meetings in accordance with the development of North America and Central America were transferred to a high-level conference focused on safety and economic well-being, after the last year, as a preliminary step to prevent migration in the US.
However, for the middle of September, the Highlands of Administration clearly concluded that they wanted to go forward to the conference and actually stopped discussing the issues of fines for El Salvador.
According to diplomats, Vice-President Mike Penis is now delivering a conference that is planned in the middle of October as a sign that the administration will change the places of assembly.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, the Republic of Panama and the Dominican Republic, without strict messages and punishment of Washington.
The speaker of the White House refused to make a comment on the details of debates, which was described by three American chips, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the conditions of anonymity.
Their reports have been confirmed by the third party analyst who is close to the administration and also talked about the conditions of anonymity.
Study History
The next step may be a special lawyer Robert Muller’s report on possible obstruction of Mr. Trump justices, which today is quite important evidence in public accounts.
Mr. Muler also reports that his investigation is beyond whether Mr. Trump's campaign was in conspiracy with Russia during our elections.
If the convention is on hand, then Mr. Trump himself will face an accountability, as well as he is preparing to talk to voters, and in the end, before his colleagues.
It's very much, and I don't mean that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable - just like its equivalents in Europe.
We all make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stop Hitler, only to resist the West, and to support the Armenian troops in Munich.
We've got it, and we've got it, and we've got the opportunity to avoid being killed.
The course of history spins around such inflation, and the democracy breaks down in the marsh or delays.
Americans are facing this turning point today.
What will you do if Mr. Trump will be released from the position of the General Prosecutor of Rod Rossenstein, who controls the fate of Mr. Muller?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since the newspaper reported that last year he decided to subscribe to the President and talked about his insufficient position.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times’ story is wrong.
“How to respond if the investigation of Brut Cavalo recently requested by the F.B.I. is not complete or fair - or if it was confirmed in the Supreme Court, despite the trusted accusations due to sexual violence and insufficient evidence?
And first of all, will there be a average vote for a convention that will bring a trump to justice?
If we survive this test, the democracy will continue with a long winter period.
But I believe we can learn from the lesson I went to Prague.
My mother was Czechoslovakia Jewish, who was deported by the same Nazi regime in Auishvili, which once held a house of Embassy.
He survived, Immigration to America, and after 60 years, I sent me to this studio table of Sabbath candles.
In this way, as a heritage, how can I not be about a optimistic future? "

Reingerer Greham Dorrans is optimistic about the match of Wine Rapid
On Thursday, Reinger hosted Ven Rapid, knowing that the victory with Australians, after the impressive flight to Spain from the beginning of this month, they would have built a place to get out of Europe from the League G Group.

“It was a good moment for us, because the violin is a good side,” said a 31-year-old footballer.
"We went to the game because we had to get something, and we got one score.
Perhaps we could do something at the end, but the end of the flight was a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we went to the second half and we'd love it.
Thursday, it's another great European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game, because they had good results in the last match, but with the fans, I am sure we can achieve success and bring positive results.
Last year it was really difficult to get out of my traumas, and it's now a optimistic factor.
The team is good and the boys really play well; the preparation is also good.
I hope we can move forward, leave the past season and succeed."

Russian Grand Prix: Luis Hamilton is approaching the world championship, after the team requires the victory of the Sebastian Festival.
The last moment it became known that Walter Botts attended Louis Hamilton on Saturday, and Mercedes' orders played a great role in the competition.
Bottas started well and almost uninstalled Hamilton, after he defended his position in the first two attacks, and led to the attack of his cognitives.
Wetley first entered the pistop and left Hamilton to drop into the track group's tail, which would have been crucial.

It was really bad gestures.
President Donald Trump was a Senator of Diana Feinstein that he did not hesitate to write a letter from Christina Blais Ford, in which the candidate of Supreme Court was accused by the accused of sexual violence by the Supreme Court of Bratino Cavano.
During the meeting in Western Virginia, the President did not directly address the Fordit Court Committee before the Forest Senate, instead of making a comment that the events in Senate showed that people were “care, deficient and liar.”
“One thing that can happen and a wonderful thing that lasts for the last few days in the Senate, when you see the rage when you see people who are angry and angry and hungry,” he said.
"When you see the releases and the information, and when they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do You Recall?
Diana Feinstein, did you share information?
Remember his answer... I don't know the letter - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I don't know."
Then, wait a minute.
We've distributed -- no, we're not surprised," he added to the impression received from the Senator.

The number of apostates in the North Korea “will fall” under the Kim
After Kim Ken Yin came to power seven years ago, the number of apostates decreased from North Korea to South Korea, said the South Korean MPs.
Park Byeong-seug, based on the data of the South United States, says that last year there were 1,127 apostates, compared to 2,706 apostates in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, tightening the border control between North Korea and China, and high tariffs made by counterbadists were important factors.
Pyongyang did not make public comments.
Most of the apostates from the North eventually offer the South Korean citizenship.
In Seoul, it is said that after the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 300,000 of the North Korean borders were illegally crossing.
Most of China through a mileage that has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to overcome than the two Koreans reliablely protected demilitated zone (DMZ).
China considers apostates as non-legal migrants, not refugees, and often responds to their internal reputation.
The relationship between North and South countries, which is still in the war, has improved significantly over the past months.
At the beginning of this month, the leader of two countries met each other for negotiations in Pionggan, which was concentrated on the nuclear detergent.
This happened in Singapore after the historic meeting of the President of the US President Donald Trump and Kim Johng-Yun June, when they generally agreed to work at the Ukrainian Peninsula.
But on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Ong-hom accused the US sanctions due to the lack of progress.

Nancy Petlos calls Brut Cavano "hisstery", and said that he did not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader Nancy Peloys Pelos, the candidate of the Supreme Court, called Brut Cavano, and said that he was not suited to work in the Supreme Court because of the temperament of the temperament.
Petlos made a comment on the Saturday in the Texas Festival in Ottoman.
"I couldn't, but I think if a woman was going to act as her mother, he was called "the Territory," - said Petlos on his reaction to the Candidate Views of the Senate Justice Committee.
Kawagna was emotionally rejected by the accusations that she had sexual intercourse with Dr. Christina Blade in her youth.
In his introduction to the speech, Cavano was very emotional, sometimes almost tired of talking about his family and school periods.
He also made democrats in the committee and called his father "the coordinated murder of the grotetic and characters", which was organized by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Palos said that Cavano's testimony was confirmed that the Supreme Court would not work, because it shows that he was biased against the democracy.
“I think he will improve his self-determination with these statements and in the way he went after clinton and democrats,” he said.
Pelos was amazed when he asked him whether he would seek the Cavano Impact if he was deficient, and whether the Democrats will receive the majority of the representatives in the chamber.
"I say so -- if he doesn't tell the truth at the convention or at the FBI, then he is not suitable not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which it is present," he said.
Caavano is currently a judge of the Court of Appeals of the Columbia District.
Pelos added that as a democracy, he is concerned about the law of medical assistance available to Cavano or Roy V. Wyd, because he is considered a conservative judge.
On hearing about approval on his position, Caavano gave himself questions about whether he will cancel any decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time when the hysterical, biased person will go to court and have the expectation that we will say "How wonderful it is," said Petlos.
And women should use this.
It's fair talking about, for months and years of rage, and it can't display it without crying.
"We're angry when we're angry," I told me acrylic. The stylishness after 45 years.
"I don't think this is unusual, you?"
He continued: “I was very helped by a woman who was somewhere in the government, who said she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed techniques that meant that when she was angry and began to cry, she told the man who was talking to:” You might think I'm sad because I'm watri.
I'm angry."
And then he just continued on his way.
And I thought it's wonderful."
Tears are allowed partially as an expression of anger, because it is fundamentally wrong.
One of my most bitter memories of my early work, where men dominated me, was when I once found out that I was a vet because of unreliable rage, one old woman came to me on the checho, one of the cold managers I was always afraid of - and she was tired of the stairs.
"Don't forget to cry," - he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy that they got what they wanted.

"You realized that clinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember, I thought, what do I put on my grave stone?
"He's a tit?"
